      "taught, as the phrase was, the size of his foot--their friend had launched\n",
      "his bolt quite out of the blue and had thereby so shaken them as to make\n",
      "them fear almost more than hope. The place had fallen vacant by the death\n",

      "duties for fifteen years; the daughter was staying on alone, to\n",
      "accommodate, but had found, though extremely mature, an opportunity of\n",
      "marriage that involved retirement, and the question of the new incumbents\n",
      "was not a little pressing. The want thus determined was of a united couple\n",
      "of some sort, of the right sort, a pair of educated and competent sisters\n",
      "possibly preferred, but a married pair having its advantages if other\n",
      "qualifications were marked. Applicants, candidates, besiegers of the door\n",
      "of every one supposed to have a voice in the matter, were already beyond\n",

      "waiting in silence--though absolutely, as happened, no busy body had\n",
      "brought them, far away in the North, a hint either of bliss or of danger;\n",
      "and the happy spell, for the rest, had obviously been wrought in him by a\n",

      "itself as their permanent portion. The little boy's death would, as they\n",
      "said, have done for them, yet his recovery hadn't saved them; with which it\n",
      "was doubtless also part of a shy but stiff candour in them that they didn't\n",
      "regard themselves as having in a more indirect manner laid up treasure.\n",
      "Treasure was not to be, in any form whatever, of their dreams or of their\n",
      "waking sense; and the years that followed had limped under their weight,\n",
      "had now and then rather grievously stumbled, had even barely escaped laying\n",
      "them in the dust. The school hadn't prospered, had but dwindled to a close.\n",
      "Gedge's health had failed and still more every sign in him of a capacity to\n",
      "publish himself as practical. He had tried several things, he had tried\n",
      "many, but the final appearance was of their having tried him not less. They\n",
      "mostly, at the time I speak of, were trying his successors, while he found\n",
      "himself, with an effect of dull felicity that had come in this case from\n",
      "the mere postponement of change, in charge of the grey town-library of\n",
      "Blackport-on-Dwindle, all granite, fog and female fiction. This was a\n",
      "situation in which his general intelligence--admittedly his strong\n",
      "point--was doubtless imaged, around him, as feeling less of a strain than\n",
      "that mastery of particulars in which he was recognised as weak.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at Blackport-on-Dwindle that the silver shaft reached and pierced\n",
      "him; it was as an alternative to dispensing dog's-eared volumes the very\n",
      "titles of which, on the lips of innumerable glib girls, were a challenge to\n",
      "his nerves, that the wardenship of so different a temple presented itself.\n",
      "The stipend named exceeded little the slim wage at present paid him, but\n",
      "even had it been less the interest and the honour would have struck him as\n",
      "determinant. The shrine at which he was to preside--though he had always\n",
      "lacked occasion to approach it--figured to him as the most sacred known to\n",
      "the steps of men, the early home of the supreme poet, the Mecca of the\n",
      "English-speaking race. The tears came into his eyes sooner still than into\n",
      "his wife's while he looked about with her at their actual narrow prison, so\n",
      "grim with enlightenment, so ugly with industry, so turned away from any\n",
      "dream, so intolerable to any taste. He felt as if a window had opened into\n",
      "a great green woodland, a woodland that had a name all glorious, immortal,\n",
      "that was peopled with vivid figures, each of them renowned, and that gave\n",
      "out a murmur, deep as the sound of the sea, which was the rustle in forest\n",
      "shade of all the poetry, the beauty, the colour of life. It would be\n",
      "prodigious that of this transfigured world _he_ should keep the key. No--he\n",
      "couldn't believe it, not even when Isabel, at sight of his face, came and\n",
      "helpfully kissed him. He shook his head with a strange smile. \"We shan't\n",
      "get it. Why should we? It's perfect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we don't he'll simply have been cruel; which is impossible when he has\n",
      "waited all this time to be kind.\" Mrs. Gedge did believe--she _would_;\n",
      "since the wide doors of the world of poetry had suddenly pushed back for\n",
      "them it was in the form of poetic justice that they were first to know it.\n",
      "She had her faith in their patron; it was sudden, but now complete. \"He\n",
      "remembers--that's all; and that's our strength.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what's _his_?\" Gedge asked. \"He may want to put us through, but that's\n",
      "a different thing from being able. What are our special advantages?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that we're just the thing.\" Her knowledge of the needs of the case\n",
      "was as yet, thanks to scant information, of the vaguest, and she had never,\n",
      "more than her husband, stood on the sacred spot; but she saw herself waving\n",
      "a nicely-gloved hand over a collection of remarkable objects and saying to\n",
      "a compact crowd of gaping awestruck persons: \"And now, please, _this_ way.\"\n",
      "She even heard herself meeting with promptness and decision an occasional\n",
      "inquiry from a visitor in whom audacity had prevailed over awe. She had\n",
      "once been with a cousin, years before, to a great northern castle, and that\n",
      "was the way the housekeeper had taken them round. And it was not moreover,\n",
      "either, that she thought of herself as a housekeeper: she was well above\n",
      "that, and the wave of her hand wouldn't fail to be such as to show it. This\n",
      "and much else she summed up as she answered her mate. \"Our special\n",
      "advantages are that you're a gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Gedge as if he had never thought of it, and yet as if too it\n",
      "were scarce worth thinking of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see it all,\" she went on; \"they've _had_ the vulgar--they find they\n",
      "don't do. We're poor and we're modest, but any one can see what we are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge wondered. \"Do you mean----?\" More modest than she, he didn't know quite\n",
      "what she meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're refined. We know how to speak.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do we?\"--he still, suddenly, wondered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she was from the first surer of everything than he; so that when a few\n",
      "weeks more had elapsed and the shade of uncertainty--though it was only a\n",
      "shade--had grown almost to sicken him, her triumph was to come with the\n",
      "news that they were fairly named. \"We're on poor pay, though we\n",
      "manage\"--she had at the present juncture contended for her point. \"But\n",
      "we're highly cultivated, and for them to get _that_, don't you see? without\n",
      "getting too much with it in the way of pretensions and demands, must be\n",
      "precisely their dream. We've no social position, but we don't _mind_ that\n",
      "we haven't, do we? a bit; which is because we know the difference between\n",
      "realities and shams. We hold to reality, and that gives us common sense,\n",
      "which the vulgar have less than anything and which yet must be wanted\n",
      "there, after all, as well as anywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her companion followed her, but musingly, as if his horizon had within a\n",
      "few moments grown so great that he was almost lost in it and required a new\n",
      "orientation. The shining spaces surrounded him; the association alone gave\n",
      "a nobler arch to the sky. \"Allow that we hold also a little to the romance.\n",
      "It seems to me that that's the beauty. We've missed it all our life, and\n",
      "now it's come. We shall be at headquarters for it. We shall have our fill\n",
      "of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at his face, at the effect in it of these prospects, and her own\n",
      "lighted as if he had suddenly grown handsome. \"Certainly--we shall live as\n",
      "in a fairy-tale. But what I mean is that we shall give, in a way--and so\n",
      "gladly--quite as much as we get. With all the rest of it we're for instance\n",
      "neat.\" Their letter had come to them at breakfast, and she picked a fly out\n",
      "of the butter-dish. \"It's the way we'll _keep_ the place\"--with which she\n",
      "removed from the sofa to the top of the cottage-piano a tin of biscuits\n",
      "that had refused to squeeze into the cupboard. At Blackport they were in\n",
      "lodgings--of the lowest description, she had been known to declare with a\n",
      "freedom felt by Blackport to be slightly invidious. The Birthplace--and\n",
      "that itself, after such a life, was exaltation--wouldn't be lodgings, since\n",
      "a house close beside it was set apart for the warden, a house joining on to\n",
      "it as a sweet old parsonage is often annexed to a quaint old church. It\n",
      "would all together be their home, and such a home as would make a little\n",
      "world that they would never want to leave. She dwelt on the gain, for that\n",
      "matter, to their income; as obviously, though the salary was not a change\n",
      "for the better, the house given them would make all the difference. He\n",
      "assented to this, but absently, and she was almost impatient at the range\n",
      "of his thoughts. It was as if something for him--the very swarm of\n",
      "them--veiled the view; and he presently of himself showed what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What I can't get over is its being such a man--!\" He almost, from inward\n",
      "emotion, broke down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such a man----?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Him, _him_, HIM----!\" It was too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grant-Jackson? Yes, it's a surprise, but one sees how he has been meaning,\n",
      "all the while, the right thing by us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean _Him_,\" Gedge returned more coldly; \"our becoming familiar and\n",
      "intimate--for that's what it will come to. We shall just live with Him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course--it _is_ the beauty.\" And she added quite gaily: \"The more we do\n",
      "the more we shall love Him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt--but it's rather awful. The more we _know_ Him,\" Gedge reflected,\n",
      "\"the more we shall love Him. We don't as yet, you see, know Him so very\n",
      "tremendously.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We do so quite as well, I imagine, as the sort of people they've had. And\n",
      "that probably isn't--unless you care, as we do--so awfully necessary. For\n",
      "there are the facts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--there are the facts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean the principal ones. They're all that the people--the people who\n",
      "come--want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--they must be all _they_ want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So that they're all that those who've been in charge have needed to know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" he said as if it were a question of honour, \"we must know\n",
      "everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She cheerfully acceded: she had the merit, he felt, of keeping the case\n",
      "within bounds. \"Everything. But about him personally,\" she added, \"there\n",
      "isn't, is there? so very very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More, I believe, than there used to be. They've made discoveries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a grand thought. \"Perhaps _we_ shall make some!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh I shall be content to be a little better up in what has been done.\" And\n",
      "his eyes rested on a shelf of books, half of which, little worn but much\n",
      "faded, were of the florid \"gift\" order and belonged to the house. Of those\n",
      "among them that were his own most were common specimens of the reference\n",
      "sort, not excluding an old Bradshaw and a catalogue of the town-library.\n",
      "\"We've not even a Set of our own. Of the Works,\" he explained in quick\n",
      "repudiation of the sense, perhaps more obvious, in which she might have\n",
      "taken it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a proof of their scant range of possessions this sounded almost abject,\n",
      "till the painful flush with which they met on the admission melted\n",
      "presently into a different glow. It was just for that kind of poorness that\n",
      "their new situation was, by its intrinsic charm, to console them. And Mrs.\n",
      "Gedge had a happy thought. \"Wouldn't the Library more or less have them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no, we've nothing of that sort: for what do you take us?\" This,\n",
      "however, was but the play of Gedge's high spirits: the form both depression\n",
      "and exhilaration most frequently took with him being a bitterness on the\n",
      "subject of the literary taste of Blackport. No one was so deeply acquainted\n",
      "with it. It acted with him in fact as so lurid a sign of the future that\n",
      "the charm of the thought of removal was sharply enhanced by the prospect of\n",
      "escape from it. The institution he served didn't of course deserve the\n",
      "particular reproach into which his irony had flowered; and indeed if the\n",
      "several Sets in which the Works were present were a trifle dusty, the dust\n",
      "was a little his own fault. To make up for that now he had the vision of\n",
      "immediately giving his time to the study of them; he saw himself indeed,\n",
      "inflamed with a new passion, earnestly commenting and collating. Mrs.\n",
      "Gedge, who had suggested that, till their move should come, they ought to\n",
      "read Him regularly of an evening--certain as they were to do it still more\n",
      "when in closer quarters with Him--Mrs. Gedge felt also, in her degree, the\n",
      "spell; so that the very happiest time of their anxious life was perhaps to\n",
      "have been the series of lamplight hours, after supper, in which,\n",
      "alternately taking the book, they declaimed, they almost performed, their\n",
      "beneficent author. He became speedily more than their author--their\n",
      "personal friend, their universal light, their final authority and divinity.\n",
      "Where in the world, they were already asking themselves, would they have\n",
      "been without Him? By the time their appointment arrived in form their\n",
      "relation to Him had immensely developed. It was amusing to Morris Gedge\n",
      "that he had so lately blushed for his ignorance, and he made this remark to\n",
      "his wife during the last hour they were able to give their study before\n",
      "proceeding, across half the country, to the scene of their romantic future.\n",
      "It was as if, in deep close throbs, in cool after-waves that broke of a\n",
      "sudden and bathed his mind, all possession and comprehension and sympathy,\n",
      "all the truth and the life and the story, had come to him, and come, as the\n",
      "newspapers said, to stay. \"It's absurd,\" he didn't hesitate to say, \"to\n",
      "talk of our not 'knowing.' So far as we don't it's because we're dunces.\n",
      "He's _in_ the thing, over His ears, and the more we get into it the more\n",
      "we're with Him. I seem to myself at any rate,\" he declared, \"to _see_ Him\n",
      "in it as if He were painted on the wall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh _doesn't_ one rather, the dear thing? And don't you feel where it is?\"\n",
      "Mrs. Gedge finely asked. \"We see Him because we love Him--that's what we\n",
      "do. How can we not, the old darling--with what He's doing for us? There's\n",
      "no light\"--she had a sententious turn--\"like true affection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I suppose that's it. And yet,\" her husband mused, \"I see, confound\n",
      "me, the faults.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's because you're so critical. You see them, but you don't mind them.\n",
      "You see them, but you forgive them. You mustn't mention them _there_. We\n",
      "shan't, you know, be there for _that_.\"\n",

      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "If the sweetness of the preliminary months had been great, great too,\n",
      "though almost excessive as agitation, was the wonder of fairly being housed\n",
      "with Him, of treading day and night in the footsteps He had worn, of\n",
      "touching the objects, or at all events the surfaces, the substances, over\n",
      "which His hands had played, which His arms, His shoulders had rubbed, of\n",
      "breathing the air--or something not too unlike it--in which His voice had\n",
      "sounded. They had had a little at first their bewilderments, their\n",
      "disconcertedness; the place was both humbler and grander than they had\n",
      "exactly prefigured, more at once of a cottage and of a museum, a little\n",
      "more archaically bare and yet a little more richly official. But the sense\n",
      "was strong with them that the point of view, for the inevitable ease of the\n",
      "connexion, patiently, indulgently awaited them; in addition to which, from\n",
      "the first evening, after closing-hour, when the last blank pilgrim had\n",
      "gone, the mere spell, the mystic presence--as if they had had it quite to\n",
      "themselves--were all they could have desired. They had received, at\n",
      "Grant-Jackson's behest and in addition to a table of instructions and\n",
      "admonitions by the number and in some particulars by the nature of which\n",
      "they found themselves slightly depressed, various little guides, manuals,\n",
      "travellers' tributes, literary memorials and other catch-penny\n",
      "publications; which, however, were to be for the moment swallowed up in the\n",
      "interesting episode of the induction or initiation appointed for them in\n",
      "advance at the hands of several persons whose relation to the establishment\n",
      "was, as superior to their own, still more official, and at those in\n",
      "especial of one of the ladies who had for so many years borne the brunt.\n",
      "About the instructions from above, about the shilling books and the\n",
      "well-known facts and the full-blown legend, the supervision, the\n",
      "subjection, the submission, the view as of a cage in which he should\n",
      "circulate and a groove in which he should slide, Gedge had preserved a\n",
      "certain play of mind; but all power of reaction appeared suddenly to desert\n",
      "him in the presence of his so visibly competent predecessor and as an\n",
      "effect of her good offices. He had not the resource, enjoyed by his wife,\n",
      "of seeing himself, with impatience, attired in black silk of a make\n",
      "characterised by just the right shade of austerity; so that this firm\n",
      "smooth expert and consummately respectable middle-aged person had him\n",
      "somehow, on the whole ground, completely at her mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evidently something of a rueful moment when, as a lesson--she being\n",
      "for the day or two still in the field--he accepted Miss Putchin's\n",
      "suggestion of \"going round\" with her and with the successive squads of\n",
      "visitors she was there to deal with. He appreciated her method--he saw\n",
      "there had to be one; he admired her as succinct and definite; for there\n",
      "were the facts, as his wife had said at Blackport, and they were to be\n",
      "disposed of in the time; yet he felt a very little boy as he dangled, more\n",
      "than once, with Mrs. Gedge, at the tail of the human comet. The idea had\n",
      "been that they should by this attendance more fully embrace the possible\n",
      "accidents and incidents, so to put it, of the relation to the great public\n",
      "in which they were to find themselves; and the poor man's excited\n",
      "perception of the great public rapidly became such as to resist any\n",
      "diversion meaner than that of the admirable manner of their guide. It\n",
      "wandered from his gaping companions to that of the priestess in black silk,\n",
      "whom he kept asking himself if either he or Isabel could hope by any\n",
      "possibility ever remotely to resemble; then it bounded restlessly back to\n",
      "the numerous persons who revealed to him as it had never yet been revealed\n",
      "the happy power of the simple to hang upon the lips of the wise. The great\n",
      "thing seemed to be--and quite surprisingly--that the business was easy and\n",
      "the strain, which as a strain they had feared, moderate; so that he might\n",
      "have been puzzled, had he fairly caught himself in the act, by his\n",
      "recognising as the last effect of the impression an odd absence of the\n",
      "power really to rest in it, an agitation deep within him that vaguely\n",
      "threatened to grow. \"It isn't, you see, so very complicated,\" the black\n",
      "silk lady seemed to throw off, with everything else, in her neat crisp\n",
      "cheerful way; in spite of which he already, the very first time--that is\n",
      "after several parties had been in and out and up and down--went so far as\n",
      "to wonder if there weren't more in it than she imagined. She was, so to\n",
      "speak, kindness itself--was all encouragement and reassurance; but it was\n",
      "just her slightly coarse redolence of these very things that, on\n",
      "repetition, before they parted, dimmed a little, as he felt, the light of\n",
      "his acknowledging smile. This again she took for a symptom of some pleading\n",
      "weakness in him--he could never be as brave as she; so that she wound up\n",
      "with a few pleasant words from the very depth of her experience. \"You'll\n",
      "get into it, never fear--it will _come_; and then you'll feel as if you had\n",
      "never done anything else.\" He was afterwards to know that, on the spot, at\n",
      "this moment, he must have begun to wince a little at such a menace; that he\n",
      "might come to feel as if he had never done anything but what Miss Putchin\n",
      "did loomed for him, in germ, as a penalty to pay. The support she offered,\n",
      "none the less, continued to strike him; she put the whole thing on so sound\n",
      "a basis when she said: \"You see they're so nice about it--they take such an\n",
      "interest. And they never do a thing they shouldn't. That was always every\n",
      "thing to mother and me.\" \"They,\" Gedge had already noticed, referred\n",
      "constantly and hugely, in the good woman's talk, to the millions who\n",
      "shuffled through the house; the pronoun in question was for ever on her\n",
      "lips, the hordes it represented filled her consciousness, the addition of\n",
      "their numbers ministered to her glory. Mrs. Gedge promptly fell in. \"It\n",
      "must be indeed delightful to see the effect on so many and to feel that one\n",
      "may perhaps do something to make it--well, permanent.\" But he was kept\n",
      "silent by his becoming more sharply aware that this was a new view, for\n",
      "him, of the reference made, that he had never thought of the quality of the\n",
      "place as derived from Them, but from Somebody Else, and that They, in\n",
      "short, seemed to have got into the way of crowding Him out. He found\n",
      "himself even a little resenting this for Him--which perhaps had something\n",
      "to do with the slightly invidious cast of his next inquiry.\n",

      "His wife stepped on his toe; she deprecated levity.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his mistake fortunately was lost on their friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just why they come, that they take such an interest. I sometimes\n",
      "think they take more than about anything else in the world.\" With which\n",
      "Miss Putchin looked about at the place. \"It _is_ pretty, don't you think,\n",
      "the way they've got it now?\" This, Gedge saw, was a different \"They\"; it\n",
      "applied to the powers that were--the people who had appointed him, the\n",
      "governing, visiting Body, in respect to which he was afterwards to remark\n",
      "to Mrs. Gedge that a fellow--it was the difficulty--didn't know \"where to\n",
      "have her.\" His wife, at a loss, questioned at that moment the necessity of\n",
      "having her anywhere, and he said, good-humouredly, \"Of course; it's all\n",
      "right.\" He was in fact content enough with the last touches their friend\n",
      "had given the picture. \"There are many who know all about it when they\n",
      "come, and the Americans often are tremendously up. Mother and me really\n",
      "enjoyed\"--it was her only slip--\"the interest of the Americans. We've\n",
      "sometimes had ninety a day, and all wanting to see and hear everything. But\n",
      "you'll work them off; you'll see the way--it's all experience.\" She came\n",
      "back for his comfort to that. She came back also to other things: she did\n",
      "justice to the considerable class who arrived positive and primed. \"There\n",
      "are those who know more about it than you do. But _that_ only comes from\n",
      "their interest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who know more about what?\" Gedge inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why about the place. I mean they have their ideas--of what everything is,\n",
      "and _where_ it is, and what it isn't and where it _should_ be. They do ask\n",
      "questions,\" she said, yet not so much in warning as in the complacency of\n",
      "being herself seasoned and sound; \"and they're down on you when they think\n",
      "you go wrong. As if you ever could! You know too much,\" she astutely\n",
      "smiled; \"or you _will_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh you mustn't know _too_ much, must you?\" And Gedge now smiled as well. He\n",
      "knew, he thought, what he meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you must know as much as anybody else. I claim at any rate that I\n",
      "do,\" Miss Putchin declared. \"They never really caught me out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm very certain of _that_\"--and Mrs. Gedge had an elation almost\n",
      "personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely,\" he said, \"I don't want to be caught out.\" She rejoined that in\n",
      "such a case he would have _Them_ down on him, and he saw that this time she\n",
      "meant the powers above. It quickened his sense of all the elements that\n",
      "were to reckon with, yet he felt at the same time that the powers above\n",
      "were not what he should most fear. \"I'm glad,\" he observed, \"that they ever\n",
      "ask questions; but I happened to notice, you know, that no one did to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you missed several--and no loss. There were three or four put to me\n",
      "too silly to remember. But of course they mostly _are_ silly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean the questions?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed with all her cheer. \"Yes, sir; I don't mean the answers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon, for a moment snubbed and silent, he felt like one of the crowd.\n",
      "Then it made him slightly vicious. \"I didn't know but you meant the people\n",

      "_they're_ wise, only occasionally breaking down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't really till then, he thought, that she lost patience; and he had\n",
      "had, much more than he meant no doubt, a cross-questioning air. \"You'll see\n",
      "for yourself.\" Of which he was sure enough. He was in fact so ready to take\n",
      "this that she came round to full accommodation, put it frankly that every\n",
      "now and then they broke out--not the silly, oh no, the intensely inquiring.\n",
      "\"We've had quite lively discussions, don't you know, about well-known\n",
      "points. They want it all _their_ way, and I know the sort that are going to\n",
      "as soon as I see them. That's one of the things you do--you get to know the\n",
      "sorts. And if it's what you're afraid of--their taking you up,\" she was\n",
      "further gracious enough to say, \"you needn't mind a bit. What _do_ they\n",
      "know, after all, when for us it's our life? I've never moved an inch,\n",
      "because, you see, I shouldn't have been here if I didn't know where I was.\n",
      "No more will _you_ be a year hence--you know what I mean, putting it\n",
      "impossibly--if you don't. I expect you do, in spite of your fancies.\" And\n",
      "she dropped once more to bed-rock. \"There are the facts. Otherwise where\n",
      "would any of us be? That's all you've got to go upon. A person, however\n",
      "cheeky, can't have them _his_ way just because he takes it into his head.\n",
      "There can only be _one_ way, and,\" she gaily added as she took leave of\n",

      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge not only assented eagerly--one way _was_ quite enough if it were the\n",
      "right one--but repeated it, after this conversation, at odd moments,\n",
      "several times over to his wife. \"There can only be one way, one way,\" he\n",
      "continued to remark--though indeed much as if it were a joke; till she\n",
      "asked him how many more he supposed she wanted. He failed to answer this\n",
      "question, but resorted to another repetition. \"There are the facts, the\n",
      "facts,\" which perhaps, however, he kept a little more to himself, sounding\n",
      "it at intervals in different parts of the house. Mrs. Gedge was full of\n",
      "comment on their clever introductress, though not restrictively save in the\n",
      "matter of her speech, \"Me and mother,\" and a general tone--which certainly\n",
      "was not their sort of thing. \"I don't know,\" he said, \"perhaps it comes\n",
      "with the place, since speaking in immortal verse doesn't seem to come. It\n",
      "must be, one seems to see, one thing or the other. I daresay that in a few\n",
      "months I shall also be at it--'me and the wife.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not 'me and the missus' at once?\" Mrs. Gedge resentfully inquired. \"I\n",
      "don't think,\" she observed at another time, \"that I quite know what's the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's only that I'm excited, awfully excited--as I don't see how one can't\n",

      "implication of the other possibility that was doubtless but part of his\n",
      "fine ecstasy, \"we shall live through it.\" The place acted on his\n",
      "imagination--how, surely, shouldn't it? And his imagination acted on his\n",
      "nerves, and these things together, with the general vividness and the new\n",
      "and complete immersion, made rest for him almost impossible, so that he\n",
      "could scarce go to bed at night and even during the first week more than\n",
      "once rose in the small hours to move about, up and down, with his\n",
      "lamp--standing, sitting, listening, wondering, in the stillness, as if\n",
      "positively to recover some echo, to surprise some secret, of the _genius\n",
      "loci_. He couldn't have explained it--and didn't in fact need to explain\n",

      "he felt himself on the way habitually to put it, predominant, insistent,\n",
      "all in the foreground--brought him, or ought to have brought him, he seemed\n",
      "to see, nearer to the enshrined Presence, enlarging the opportunity for\n",
      "communion and intensifying the sense of it. These nightly prowls, as he\n",
      "called them, were disquieting to his wife, who had no disposition to share\n",
      "in them, speaking with decision of the whole place as just the place to be\n",
      "forbidding after dark. She rejoiced in the distinctness, contiguous though\n",
      "it was, of their own little residence, where she trimmed the lamp and\n",
      "stirred the fire and heard the kettle sing, repairing the while the\n",
      "omissions of the small domestic who slept out; she foresaw her self, with\n",
      "some promptness, drawing rather sharply the line between her own precinct\n",
      "and that in which the great spirit might walk. It would be with them, the\n",
      "great spirit, all day--even if indeed on her making that remark, and in\n",
      "just that form, to her husband, he replied with a queer \"But will he\n",
      "though?\" And she vaguely imaged the development of a domestic antidote\n",
      "after a while, precisely, in the shape of curtains more markedly drawn and\n",
      "everything most modern and lively, tea, \"patterns,\" the newspapers, the\n",
      "female fiction itself that they had reacted against at Blackport, quite\n",
      "defiantly cultivated.\n",

      "These possibilities, however, were all right, as her companion said it was,\n",
      "all the first autumn--they had arrived at summer's end; and he might have\n",
      "been more than content with a special set of his own that he had access to\n",
      "from behind, passing out of their low door for the few steps between it and\n",
      "the Birthplace. With his lamp ever so carefully guarded and his nursed keys\n",
      "that made him free of treasures, he crossed the dusky interval so often\n",
      "that she began to qualify it as a habit that \"grew.\" She spoke of it almost\n",
      "as if he had taken to drink, and he humoured that view of it by allowing\n",
      "the cup to be strong. This had been in truth altogether his immediate sense\n",
      "of it; strange and deep for him the spell of silent sessions before\n",
      "familiarity and, to some small extent, disappointment had set in. The\n",
      "exhibitional side of the establishment had struck him, even on arrival, as\n",
      "qualifying too much its character; he scarce knew what he might best have\n",
      "looked for, but the three or four rooms bristled overmuch, in the garish\n",
      "light of day, with busts and relics, not even ostensibly always _His_, old\n",
      "prints and old editions, old objects fashioned in His likeness, furniture\n",
      "\"of the time\" and autographs of celebrated worshippers. In the quiet hours\n",
      "and the deep dusk, none the less, under the play of the shifted lamp and\n",

      "about the secret he asked them while he restlessly wandered. It wasn't till\n",
      "months had elapsed that he found how little they had to tell him, and he\n",
      "was quite at his ease with them when he knew they were by no means where\n",
      "his sensibility had first placed them. They were as out of it as he; only,\n",
      "to do them justice, they had made him immensely feel. And still, too, it\n",

      "they mostly found words--it was so pathetic; and pathetic because it\n",
      "was--well, really nothing else in the world that one could name, number or\n",

      "born, so Gedge, though little of a critic, clung to the square feet of\n",
      "space that connected themselves, however feebly, with the positive\n",
      "appearance. He was little of a critic--he was nothing of one; he hadn't\n",

      "luckily for him, he was seeing day by day how little use he could possibly\n",

      "a stumbling-block, and that he rejoiced, as the winter waned, in his\n",

      "more. An impression or two nevertheless remained with her from it, as he\n",
      "saw from a question she asked him on the morrow. \"What did you mean\n",
      "yesterday about Miss Putchin's simplicity--its keeping her 'straight'? Do\n",

      "reply, though with his look a little sad for her, might have denoted that,\n",
      "allowing for extravagance of statement, he saw there was something in it:\n",
      "\"Give up your prowls. Keep it for daylight. Keep it for _Them_.\"\n",

      "seasoning of the spirit--by which he meant a certain command of\n",
      "impenetrable patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patience was needed for the particular feature of the ordeal that, by\n",
      "the time the lively season was with them again, had disengaged itself as\n",
      "the sharpest--the immense assumption of veracities and sanctities, of the\n",
      "general soundness of the legend, with which every one arrived. He was well\n",
      "provided certainly for meeting it, and he gave all he had, yet he had\n",
      "sometimes the sense of a vague resentment on the part of his pilgrims at\n",
      "his not ladling out their fare with a bigger spoon. An irritation had begun\n",
      "to grumble in him during the comparatively idle months of winter when a\n",
      "pilgrim would turn up singly. The pious individual, entertained for the\n",
      "half-hour, had occasionally seemed to offer him the promise of beguilement\n",
      "or the semblance of a personal relation; it came back again to the few\n",
      "pleasant calls he had received in the course of a life almost void of\n",
      "social amenity. Sometimes he liked the person, the face, the speech: an\n",
      "educated man, a gentleman, not one of the herd; a graceful woman, vague,\n",
      "accidental, unconscious of him, but making him wonder, while he hovered,\n",
      "who she was. These chances represented for him light yearnings and faint\n",
      "flutters; they acted indeed within him to a special, an extraordinary tune.\n",
      "He would have liked to talk with such stray companions, to talk with them\n",
      "_really_, to talk with them as he might have talked had he met them where\n",
      "he couldn't meet them--at dinner, in the \"world,\" on a visit at a\n",
      "country-house. Then he could have said--and about the shrine and the idol\n",
      "always--things he couldn't say now. The form in which his irritation first\n",
      "came to him was that of his feeling obliged to say to them--to the single\n",
      "visitor, even when sympathetic, quite as to the gaping group--the\n",
      "particular things, a dreadful dozen or so, that they expected. If he had\n",
      "thus arrived at characterising these things as dreadful the reason touched\n",
      "the very point that, for a while turning everything over, he kept dodging,\n",
      "not facing, trying to ignore. The point was that he was on his way to\n",
      "become two quite different persons, the public and the private--as to which\n",
      "it would somehow have to be managed that these persons should live\n",
      "together. He was splitting into halves, unmistakably--he who, whatever else\n",
      "he had been, had at least always been so entire and in his way so solid.\n",
      "One of the halves, or perhaps even, since the split promised to be rather\n",
      "unequal, one of the quarters, was the keeper, the showman, the priest of\n",
      "the idol; the other piece was the poor unsuccessful honest man he had\n",
      "always been.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were moments when he recognised this primary character as he had\n",
      "never done before; when he in fact quite shook in his shoes at the idea\n",
      "that it perhaps had in reserve some supreme assertion of its identity. It\n",
      "was honest, verily, just by reason of the possibility. It was poor and\n",
      "unsuccessful because here it was just on the verge of quarrelling with its\n",
      "bread and butter. Salvation would be of course--the salvation of the\n",
      "showman--rigidly to _keep_ it on the verge; not to let it, in other words,\n",
      "overpass by an inch. He might count on this, he said to himself, if there\n",
      "weren't any public--if there weren't thousands of people demanding of him\n",
      "what he was paid for. He saw the approach of the stage at which they would\n",
      "affect him, the thousands of people--and perhaps even more the earnest\n",
      "individual--as coming really to see if he were earning his wage. Wouldn't\n",
      "he soon begin to fancy them in league with the Body, practically deputed by\n",
      "it--given, no doubt, a kindled suspicion--to look in and report\n",
      "observations? It was the way he broke down with the lonely pilgrim that led\n",
      "to his first heart-searchings--broke down as to the courage required for\n",
      "damping an uncritical faith. What they all most wanted was to feel that\n",
      "everything was \"just as it was\"; only the shock of having to part with that\n",
      "vision was greater than any individual could bear unsupported. The bad\n",
      "moments were upstairs in the Birthroom, for here the forces pressing on the\n",
      "very edge assumed a dire intensity. The mere expression of eye,\n",
      "all-credulous, omnivorous and fairly moistening in the act, with which many\n",
      "persons gazed about, might eventually make it difficult for him to remain\n",
      "fairly civil. Often they came in pairs--sometimes one had come before---and\n",
      "then they explained to each other. He in that case never corrected; he\n",
      "listened, for the lesson of listening: after which he would remark to his\n",
      "wife that there was no end to what he was learning. He saw that if he\n",
      "should really ever break down it would be with her he would begin. He had\n",
      "given her hints and digs enough, but she was so inflamed with appreciation\n",
      "that she either didn't feel them or pretended not to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the greater complication that, with the return of the spring and\n",
      "the increase of the public, her services were more required. She took the\n",
      "field with him from an early hour; she was present with the party above\n",
      "while he kept an eye, and still more an ear, on the party below; and how\n",
      "could he know, he asked himself, what she might say to them and what she\n",
      "might suffer _Them_ to say--or in other words, poor wretches, to\n",
      "believe--while removed from his control? Some day or other, and before too\n",
      "long, he couldn't but think, he must have the matter out with her--the\n",
      "matter, namely, of the _morality_ of their position. The morality of women\n",
      "was special--he was getting lights on that. Isabel's conception of her\n",
      "office was to cherish and enrich the legend. It was already, the legend,\n",
      "very taking, but what was she there for but to make it more so? She\n",
      "certainly wasn't there to chill any natural piety. If it was all in the\n",
      "air--all in their \"eye,\" as the vulgar might say--that He _had_ been born\n",
      "in the Birthroom, where was the value of the sixpences they took? where the\n",
      "equivalent they had engaged to supply? \"Oh dear, yes--just about _here_\";\n",
      "and she must tap the place with her foot. \"Altered? Oh dear, no--save in a\n",
      "few trifling particulars; you see the place--and isn't that just the charm\n",
      "of it?--quite as _He_ saw it. Very poor and homely, no doubt; but that's\n",
      "just what's so wonderful.\" He didn't want to hear her, and yet he didn't\n",
      "want to give her her head; he didn't want to make difficulties or to snatch\n",
      "the bread from her mouth. But he must none the less give her a warning\n",
      "before they had gone _too_ far. That was the way, one evening in June, he\n",
      "put it to her; the affluence, with the finest weather, having lately been\n",
      "of the largest and the crowd all day fairly gorged with the story. \"We\n",
      "mustn't, you know, go _too_ far.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The odd thing was that she had now ceased even to be conscious of what\n",
      "troubled him--she was so launched in her own career. \"Too far for what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To save our immortal souls. We mustn't, love, tell too many lies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him with dire reproach. \"Ah now are you going to begin\n",
      "again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never _have_ begun; I haven't wanted to worry you. But, you know, we\n",
      "don't know anything about it.\" And then as she stared, flushing: \"About His\n",
      "having been born up there. About anything really. Not the least little\n",
      "scrap that would weigh in any other connexion as evidence. So don't rub it\n",
      "in so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rub it in how?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That He _was_ born----\" But at sight of her face he only sighed. \"Oh dear,\n",
      "oh dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you think,\" she replied cuttingly, \"that He was born anywhere?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated--it was such an edifice to shake. \"Well, we don't know.\n",
      "There's very little _to_ know. He covered His tracks as no other human\n",
      "being has ever done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was still in her public costume and hadn't taken off the gloves she\n",
      "made a point of wearing as a part of that uniform; she remembered how the\n",
      "rustling housekeeper in the Border castle, on whom she had begun by\n",
      "modelling herself, had worn them. She seemed official and slightly distant.\n",
      "\"To cover His tracks He must have had to exist. Have we got to give\n",
      "_that_ up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't ask you to give it up _yet_. But there's very little to go\n",
      "upon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is that what I'm to tell Them in return for everything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge waited--he walked about. The place was doubly still after the bustle of\n",
      "the day, and the summer evening rested on it as a blessing, making it, in its\n",
      "small state and ancientry, mellow and sweet. It was good to be there and it\n",
      "would be good to stay. At the same time there was something incalculable in the\n",
      "effect on one's nerves of the great gregarious density. This was an attitude\n",
      "that had nothing to do with degrees and shades, the attitude of wanting all or\n",
      "nothing. And you couldn't talk things over with it. You could only do that with\n",
      "friends, and then but in cases where you were sure the friends wouldn't betray\n",
      "you. \"Couldn't you adopt,\" he replied at last, \"a slightly more discreet method?\n",
      "What we can say is that things have been _said_; that's all we have to do with.\n",
      "'And is this really'--when they jam their umbrellas into the floor--'the very\n",
      "_spot_ where He was born?' 'So it has, from a long time back, been described as\n",
      "being.' Couldn't one meet Them, to be decent a little, in some such way as\n",
      "that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him very hard. \"Is that the way _you_ meet them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I've kept on lying--without scruple, without shame.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why do you haul me up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it has seemed to me we might, like true companions, work it out a\n",
      "little together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not strong, he felt, as, pausing with his hands in his pockets, he\n",
      "stood before her; and he knew it as weaker still after she had looked at\n",
      "him a minute. \"Morris Gedge, I propose to be _your_ true companion, and\n",
      "I've come here to stay. That's all I've got to say.\" It was not, however,\n",
      "for \"You had better try yourself and see,\" she presently added. \"Give the\n",
      "place, give the story away, by so much as a look, and--well, I'd allow you\n",
      "about nine days. Then you'd see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He feigned, to gain time, an innocence. \"They'd take it so ill?\" And then\n",
      "as she said nothing: \"They'd turn and rend me? They'd tear me to pieces?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But she wouldn't make a joke of it. \"They wouldn't _have_ it, simply.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--They wouldn't. That's what I say. They won't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had better,\" she went on, \"begin with Grant-Jackson. But even that\n",
      "isn't necessary. It would get to him, it would get to the Body, like\n",
      "wildfire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see,\" said poor Gedge. And indeed for the moment he did see, while his\n",
      "companion followed up what she believed her advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you consider it's _all_ a fraud?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I grant you there was somebody. But the details are naught. The\n",
      "links are missing. The evidence--in particular about that room upstairs, in\n",
      "itself our Casa Santa--is _nil_. It was so awfully long ago.\" Which he knew\n",
      "again sounded weak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course it was awfully long ago--that's just the beauty and the\n",
      "interest. Tell Them, _tell_ Them,\" she continued, \"that the evidence is\n",
      "_nil_, and I'll tell Them something else.\" She spoke it with such meaning\n",
      "that his face seemed to show a question, to which she was on the spot of\n",
      "replying, \"I'll tell Them you're a----\" She stopped, however, changing it.\n",
      "\"I'll tell Them exactly the opposite. And I'll find out what you say--it\n",
      "won't take long--to do it. If we tell different stories _that_ possibly may\n",
      "save us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see what you mean. It would perhaps, as an oddity, have a success of\n",
      "curiosity. It might become a draw. Still, They but want broad masses.\" And\n",
      "he looked at her sadly. \"You're no more than one of Them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it's being no more than one of Them to love it,\" she answered, \"then I\n",
      "certainly am. And I'm not ashamed of my company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To love _what_?\" said Morris Gedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To love to think He was born there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think too much. It's bad for you.\" He turned away with his chronic\n",
      "moan. But it was without losing what she called after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I decline to let the place down.\" And what was there indeed to say? They\n",
      "_were_ there to keep it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "V\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept it up through the summer, but with the queerest consciousness, at times,\n",
      "of the want of proportion between his secret rage and the spirit of those from\n",
      "whom the friction came. He said to himself--so sore his sensibility had\n",
      "grown--that They were gregariously ferocious at the very time he was seeing Them\n",
      "as individually mild. He said to himself that They were mild only because _he_\n",
      "was--he flattered himself that he was divinely so, considering what he might be;\n",
      "and that he should, as his wife had warned him, soon enough have news of it were\n",
      "he to deflect by a hair's breadth from the line traced for him. _That_ was the\n",
      "collective fatuity--that it was capable of turning on the instant both to a\n",
      "general and to a particular resentment. Since the least breath of discrimination\n",
      "would get him the sack without mercy, it was absurd, he reflected, to speak of\n",
      "his discomfort as light. He was gagged, he was goaded, as in omnivorous\n",
      "companies he doubtless sometimes showed by a strange silent glare. They'd get\n",
      "him the sack for that as well, if he didn't look out; therefore wasn't it in\n",
      "effect ferocity when you mightn't even hold your tongue? They wouldn't let you\n",
      "off with silence--They insisted on your committing yourself. It was the pound of\n",
      "flesh--They _would_ have it; so under his coat he bled. But a wondrous peace, by\n",
      "exception, dropped on him one afternoon at the end of August. The pressure had,\n",
      "as usual, been high, but it had diminished with the fall of day, and the place\n",
      "was empty before the hour for closing. Then it was that, within a few minutes of\n",
      "this hour, there presented themselves a pair of pilgrims to whom in the ordinary\n",
      "course he would have remarked that they were, to his regret, too late. He was to\n",
      "wonder afterwards why the course had at sight of the visitors--a gentleman and a\n",
      "lady, appealing and fairly young--shown for him as other than ordinary; the\n",
      "consequence sprang doubtless from something rather fine and unnameable,\n",
      "something for example in the tone of the young man or in the light of his eye,\n",
      "after hearing the statement on the subject of the hour. \"Yes, we know it's late;\n",
      "but it's just, I'm afraid, _because_ of that. We've had rather a notion of\n",
      "escaping the crowd--as I suppose you mostly have one now; and it was really on\n",
      "the chance of finding you alone----!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These things the young man said before being quite admitted, and they were\n",
      "words any one might have spoken who hadn't taken the trouble to be punctual\n",
      "or who desired, a little ingratiatingly, to force the door. Gedge even\n",
      "guessed at the sense that might lurk in them, the hint of a special tip if\n",
      "the point were stretched. There were no tips, he had often thanked his\n",
      "stars, at the Birthplace; there was the charged fee and nothing more;\n",
      "everything else was out of order, to the relief of a palm not formed by\n",
      "nature as a scoop. Yet in spite of everything, in spite especially of the\n",
      "almost audible chink of the gentleman's sovereigns, which might in another\n",
      "case exactly have put him out, he presently found himself, in the\n",
      "Birthroom, access to which he had gracefully enough granted, almost\n",
      "treating the visit as personal and private. The reason--well, the reason\n",
      "would have been, if anywhere, in something naturally persuasive on the part\n",
      "of the couple; unless it had been rather again, in the way the young man,\n",
      "once he was in the place, met the caretaker's expression of face, held it a\n",
      "moment and seemed to wish to sound it. That they were Americans was\n",
      "promptly clear, and Gedge could very nearly have told what kind; he had\n",
      "arrived at the point of distinguishing kinds, though the difficulty might\n",
      "have been with him now that the case before him was rare. He saw it\n",
      "suddenly in the light of the golden midland evening which reached them\n",
      "through low old windows, saw it with a rush of feeling, unexpected and\n",
      "smothered, that made him a moment wish to keep it before him as a case of\n",
      "inordinate happiness. It made him feel old shabby poor, but he watched it\n",
      "no less intensely for its doing so. They were children of fortune, of the\n",
      "greatest, as it might seem to Morris Gedge, and they were of course lately\n",
      "married; the husband, smooth-faced and soft, but resolute and fine, several\n",
      "years older than the wife, and the wife vaguely, delicately, irregularly,\n",
      "but mercilessly pretty. Some how the world was theirs; they gave the person\n",
      "who took the sixpences at the Birthplace such a sense of the high luxury of\n",
      "freedom as he had never had. The thing was that the world was theirs not\n",
      "simply because they had money--he had seen rich people enough--but because\n",
      "they could in a supreme degree think and feel and say what they liked. They\n",
      "had a nature and a culture, a tradition, a facility of some sort--and all\n",
      "producing in them an effect of positive beauty--that gave a light to their\n",
      "liberty and an ease to their tone. These things moreover suffered nothing\n",
      "from the fact that they happened to be in mourning; this was probably worn\n",
      "for some lately-deceased opulent father--if not some delicate mother who\n",
      "would be sure to have been a part of the source of the beauty; and it\n",
      "affected Gedge, in the gathered twilight and at his odd crisis, as the very\n",
      "uniform of their distinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He couldn't quite have said afterwards by what steps the point had been\n",
      "reached, but it had become at the end of five minutes a part of their\n",
      "presence in the Birthroom, a part of the young man's look, a part of the\n",
      "charm of the moment, and a part above all of a strange sense within him of\n",
      "\"Now or never!\" that Gedge had suddenly, thrillingly, let himself go. He\n",
      "hadn't been definitely conscious of drifting to it; he had been, for that,\n",
      "too conscious merely of thinking how different, in all their range, were\n",
      "such a united couple from another united couple known to him. They were\n",
      "everything he and his wife weren't; this was more than anything else the\n",
      "first lesson of their talk. Thousands of couples of whom the same was true\n",
      "certainly had passed before him, but none of whom it was true with just\n",
      "that engaging intensity. And just _because_ of their transcendent freedom;\n",
      "that was what, at the end of five minutes, he saw it all come back to. The\n",
      "husband, who had been there at some earlier time, had his impression, which\n",
      "he wished now to make his wife share. But he already, Gedge could see,\n",
      "hadn't concealed it from her. A pleasant irony in fine our friend seemed to\n",
      "taste in the air--he who hadn't yet felt free to taste his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you weren't here four years ago\"--that was what the young man had\n",
      "almost begun by remarking. Gedge liked his remembering it, liked his\n",
      "frankly speaking to him; all the more that he had offered, as it were, no\n",
      "opening. He had let them look about below and then had taken them up, but\n",
      "without words, without the usual showman's song, of which he would have\n",
      "been afraid. The visitors didn't ask for it; the young man had taken the\n",
      "matter out of his hands by himself dropping for the benefit of the young\n",
      "woman a few detached remarks. What Gedge oddly felt was that these remarks\n",
      "were not inconsiderate of him; he had heard others, both of the priggish\n",
      "order and the crude, that might have been called so. And as the young man\n",
      "hadn't been aided to this cognition of him as new, it already began to make\n",
      "for them a certain common ground. The ground became immense when the\n",
      "visitor presently added with a smile: \"There was a good lady, I recollect,\n",
      "who had a great deal to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the gentleman's smile that had done it; the irony _was_ there. \"Ah\n",
      "there has been a great deal said.\" And Gedge's look at his interlocutor\n",
      "doubtless showed his sense of being sounded. It was extraordinary of course\n",
      "that a perfect stranger should have guessed the travail of his spirit,\n",
      "should have caught the gleam of his inner commentary. That probably leaked\n",
      "in spite of him out of his poor old eyes. \"Much of it, in such places as\n",
      "this,\" he heard himself adding, \"is of course said very irresponsibly.\"\n",
      "_Such places as this!_--he winced at the words as soon as he had uttered\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no wincing, however, on the part of his pleasant companions.\n",
      "\"Exactly so; the whole thing becomes a sort of stiff smug convention--like\n",

      "touch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A monster,\" Gedge assented, meeting his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man smiled, but he thought looking at him a little harder. \"A\n",
      "blasphemer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A blasphemer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to do his visitor good--he certainly _was_ looking at him harder.\n",

      "\n",
      "He had an identity for him, Gedge felt, that he couldn't have had for a\n",
      "Briton, and the impulse was quick in our friend to testify to this\n",
      "perception. \"I don't insist to _you_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man laughed. \"It really--I assure you if I may--wouldn't do any\n",
      "good. I'm too awfully interested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean,\" his wife lightly inquired, \"in--a--pulling it down? That's\n",
      "rather in what you've said to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has he said to you,\" Gedge intervened, though quaking a little, \"that he\n",
      "would like to pull it down?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The husband had laughed, but had now so completely ceased to look about him\n",
      "that there seemed nothing left for him but to talk avowedly with the\n",
      "caretaker. \"I'm interested,\" he explained, \"in what I think _the_\n",
      "interesting thing--or at all events the eternally tormenting one. The fact\n",
      "of the abysmally little that, in proportion, we know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In proportion to what?\" his companion asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, to what there must have been--to what in fact there _is_--to wonder\n",
      "about. That's the interest; it's immense. He escapes us like a thief at\n",
      "night, carrying off--well, carrying off everything. And people pretend to\n",
      "catch Him like a flown canary, over whom you can close your hand, and put\n",
      "Him back in the cage. He won't _go_ back; he won't _come_ back. He's\n",
      "not\"--the young man laughed--\"such a fool! It makes Him the happiest of all\n",
      "great men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had begun by speaking to his wife, but had ended, with his friendly, his\n",
      "easy, his indescribable competence, for Gedge--poor Gedge who quite held\n",
      "his breath and who felt, in the most unexpected way, that he had somehow\n",
      "never been in such good society. The young wife, who for herself meanwhile\n",
      "had continued to look about, sighed out, smiled out--Gedge couldn't have\n",
      "told which--her little answer to these remarks. \"It's rather a pity, you\n",
      "know, that He _isn't_ here. I mean as Goethe's at Weimar. For Goethe _is_\n",
      "at Weimar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear; that's Goethe's bad luck. There he sticks. _This_ man isn't\n",
      "anywhere. I defy you to catch him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not say, beautifully,\" the young woman laughed, \"that, like the wind,\n",
      "He's everywhere?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't of course the tone of discussion, it was the tone of pleasantry,\n",
      "though of better pleasantry, Gedge seemed to feel, and more within his own\n",
      "appreciation, than he had ever listened to; and this was precisely why the\n",
      "young man could go on without the effect of irritation, answering his wife\n",
      "but still with eyes for their companion. \"I'll be hanged if He's _here_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was almost as if he were taken--that is, struck and rather held--by\n",
      "their companion's unruffled state, which they hadn't meant to ruffle, but\n",
      "which suddenly presented its interest, perhaps even projected its light.\n",
      "The gentleman didn't know, Gedge was afterwards to say to himself, how that\n",
      "hypocrite was inwardly all of a tremble, how it seemed to him his fate was\n",
      "being literally pulled down on his head. He was trembling for the moment\n",
      "certainly too much to speak; abject he might be, but he didn't want his\n",
      "voice to have the absurdity of a quaver. And the young woman--charming\n",
      "creature!--still had another word. It was for the guardian of the spot, and\n",
      "she made it in her way delightful. They had remained in the Holy of Holies,\n",
      "where she had been looking for a minute, with a ruefulness just marked\n",
      "enough to be pretty, at the queer old floor. \"Then if you say it _wasn't_\n",
      "in this room He was born--well, what's the use?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the use of what?\" her husband asked. \"The use, you mean, of our\n",
      "coming here? Why the place is charming in itself. And it's also\n",
      "interesting,\" he added to Gedge, \"to know how you get on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge looked at him a moment in silence, but answering the young woman\n",
      "first. If poor Isabel, he was thinking, could only have been like\n",
      "that!--not as to youth, beauty, arrangement of hair or picturesque grace of\n",
      "hat--these things he didn't mind; but as to sympathy, facility, light\n",
      "perceptive, and yet not cheap, detachment! \"I don't say it wasn't--but I\n",
      "don't say it _was_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah but doesn't that,\" she returned, \"come very much to the same thing? And\n",
      "don't They want also to see where He had His dinner and where He had His\n",
      "tea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They want everything,\" said Morris Gedge. \"They want to see where He hung\n",
      "up His hat and where He kept His boots and where His mother boiled her\n",
      "pot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if you don't show them----?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They show _me_. It's in all their little books.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean,\" the husband asked, \"that you've only to hold your tongue?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I try to,\" said Gedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" his visitor smiled, \"I see you _can_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge hesitated. \"I can't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh well,\" said his friend, \"what does it matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do speak,\" he continued. \"I can't sometimes not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then how do you get on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge looked at him more abjectly, to his own sense, than ever at any\n",
      "one--even at Isabel when she frightened him. \"I don't get on. I speak,\" he\n",
      "said--\"since I've spoken to _you_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh _we_ shan't hurt you!\" the young man reassuringly laughed.\n",

      "The twilight meanwhile had sensibly thickened, the end of the visit was\n",
      "indicated. They turned together out of the upper room and came down the\n",
      "narrow stair. The words just exchanged might have been felt as producing an\n",
      "awkwardness which the young woman gracefully felt the impulse to dissipate.\n",
      "\"You must rather wonder why we've come.\" And it was the first note for\n",
      "Gedge of a further awkwardness--as if he had definitely heard it make the\n",
      "husband's hand, in a full pocket, begin to fumble.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was even a little awkwardly that the husband still held off. \"Oh we like\n",
      "it as it is. There's always _something_.\" With which they had approached\n",
      "the door of egress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is there, please?\" asked Morris Gedge, not yet opening the door,\n",
      "since he would fain have kept the pair on, and conscious only for a moment\n",
      "after he had spoken that his question was just having for the young man too\n",
      "dreadfully wrong a sound. This personage wondered yet feared, and had\n",
      "evidently for some minutes been putting himself a question; so that, with\n",
      "his preoccupation, the caretaker's words had represented to him inevitably:\n",
      "\"What is there, please, for _me_?\" Gedge already knew with it moreover\n",
      "that he wasn't stopping him in time. He had uttered that challenge to show\n",
      "he himself wasn't afraid, and he must have had in consequence, he was\n",
      "subsequently to reflect, a lamentable air of waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitor's hand came out. \"I hope I may take the liberty----?\" What\n",
      "afterwards happened our friend scarcely knew, for it fell into a slight\n",
      "confusion, the confusion of a queer gleam of gold--a sovereign fairly\n",
      "thrust at him; of a quick, almost violent motion on his own part, which, to\n",
      "make the matter worse, might well have sent the money roiling on the floor;\n",
      "and then of marked blushes all round and a sensible embarrassment;\n",
      "producing indeed in turn rather oddly and ever so quickly an increase of\n",
      "communion. It was as if the young man had offered him money to make up to\n",
      "him for having, as it were, led him on, and then, perceiving the mistake,\n",
      "but liking him the better for his refusal, had wanted to obliterate this\n",
      "aggravation of his original wrong. He had done so, presently, while Gedge\n",
      "got the door open, by saying the best thing, he could, and by saying it\n",
      "frankly and gaily. \"Luckily it doesn't at all affect the _work_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The small town-street, quiet and empty in the summer eventide, stretched to\n",
      "right and left, with a gabled and timbered house or two, and fairly seemed\n",
      "to have cleared itself to congruity with the historic void over which our\n",
      "friends, lingering an instant to converse, looked at each other. The young\n",
      "wife, rather, looked about a moment at all there wasn't to be seen, and\n",
      "then, before Gedge had found a reply to her husband's remark, uttered,\n",
      "evidently in the interest of conciliation, a little question of her own\n",
      "that she tried to make earnest. \"It's our unfortunate ignorance, you mean,\n",
      "that doesn't?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unfortunate or fortunate. I like it so,\" said the husband. \"'The play's\n",
      "the thing.' Let the author alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge, with his key on his forefinger, leaned against the door-post, took\n",
      "in the stupid little street and was sorry to see them go--they seemed so to\n",
      "abandon him. \"That's just what They won't do--nor let _me_ do. It's all I\n",
      "want--to let the author alone. Practically\"--he felt himself getting the\n",
      "last of his chance--\"there is no author; that is for us to deal with. There\n",
      "are all the immortal people--_in_ the work; but there's nobody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the young man--\"that's what it comes to. There should really,\n",
      "to clear the matter up, be no such Person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you say,\" Gedge returned, \"it's what it comes to. There _is_ no such\n",
      "Person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening air listened, in the warm thick midland stillness, while the\n",
      "wife's little cry rang out. \"But _wasn't_ there----?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was somebody,\" said Gedge against the door-post. \"But They've killed\n",
      "Him. And, dead as He is, They keep it up, They do it over again, They kill\n",
      "Him every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was aware of saying this so grimly--more than he wished--that his\n",
      "companions exchanged a glance and even perhaps looked as if they felt him\n",
      "extravagant. That was really the way Isabel had warned him all the others\n",
      "would be looking if he should talk to Them as he talked to _her_. He liked,\n",
      "however, for that matter, to hear how he should sound when pronounced\n",
      "incapable through deterioration of the brain. \"Then if there's no author,\n",
      "if there's nothing to be said but that there isn't anybody,\" the young\n",
      "woman smilingly asked, \"why in the world should there be a house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There shouldn't,\" said Morris Gedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decidedly, yes, he affected the young man. \"Oh, I don't say, mind you, that\n",
      "you should pull it down!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then where would you _go_?\" their companion sweetly inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what my wife asks,\" Gedge returned.\n",

      "\"Then keep it up, keep it up!\" And the husband held out his hand.\n",

      "their remarkable friend her handshake. \"Then mind your wife.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "It had made for him, all the same, an immense difference; it had given him\n",
      "an extraordinary lift, so that a certain sweet aftertaste of his freedom\n",
      "might a couple of months later have been suspected of aiding to produce for\n",
      "him another and really a more considerable adventure. It was an absurd way\n",
      "to reason, but he had been, to his imagination, for twenty minutes in good\n",
      "society--that being the term that best described for him the company of\n",
      "people to whom he hadn't to talk, as he phrased it, rot. It was his title\n",
      "to good society that he had, in his doubtless awkward way, affirmed; and\n",
      "the difficulty was just that, having affirmed it, he couldn't take back the\n",
      "affirmation. Few things had happened to him in life, that is few that were\n",
      "agreeable, but at least _this_ had, and he wasn't so constructed that he\n",
      "could go on as if it hadn't. It was going on as if it had, however, that\n",
      "landed him, alas! in the situation unmistakably marked by a visit from\n",
      "Grant-Jackson late one afternoon toward the end of October. This had been\n",
      "the hour of the call of the young Americans. Every day that hour had come\n",
      "round something of the deep throb of it, the successful secret, woke up;\n",
      "but the two occasions were, of a truth, related only by being so intensely\n",
      "opposed. The secret had been successful in that he had said nothing of it\n",
      "to Isabel, who, occupied in their own quarter while the incident lasted,\n",
      "had neither heard the visitors arrive nor seen them depart. It was on the\n",
      "other hand scarcely successful in guarding itself from indirect betrayals.\n",
      "There were two persons in the world at least who felt as he did; they were\n",
      "persons also who had treated him, benignly, as feeling after _their_ style;\n",
      "who had been ready in fact to overflow in gifts as a sign of it, and though\n",
      "they were now off in space they were still with him sufficiently in spirit\n",
      "to make him play, as it were, with the sense of their sympathy. This in\n",
      "turn made him, as he was perfectly aware, more than a shade or two\n",
      "reckless, so that, in his reaction from that gluttony of the public for\n",
      "false facts which had from the first tormented him, he fell into the habit\n",
      "of sailing, as he would have said, too near the wind, or in other\n",
      "words--all in presence of the people--of washing his hands of the legend.\n",
      "He had crossed the line--he knew it; he had struck wild--They drove him to\n",
      "it; he had substituted, by a succession of uncontrollable profanities, an\n",
      "attitude that couldn't be understood for an attitude that but too evidently\n",
      "_had_ been.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was of course the franker line, only he hadn't taken it, alas! for\n",
      "frankness--hadn't in the least really adopted it at all, but had been\n",
      "simply himself caught up and disposed of by it, hurled by his fate against\n",
      "the bedizened walls of the temple, quite in the way of a priest possessed\n",
      "to excess of the god, or, more vulgarly, that of a blind bull in a\n",
      "china-shop--an animal to which he often compared himself. He had let\n",
      "himself fatally go, in fine, just for irritation, for rage, having, in his\n",
      "predicament, nothing whatever to do with frankness--a luxury reserved for\n",
      "quite other situations. It had always been his view that one lived to\n",
      "learn; he had learned something every hour of his life, though people\n",
      "mostly never knew what, in spite of its having generally been--hadn't\n",
      "it?--at somebody's expense. What he was at present continually learning was\n",
      "the sense of a form of words heretofore so vain--the famous \"false\n",
      "position\" that had so often helped out a phrase. One used names in that way\n",
      "without knowing what they were worth; then of a sudden, one fine day, their\n",
      "meaning grew bitter in the mouth. This was a truth with the relish of which\n",
      "his fireside hours were occupied, and he was aware of how much it exposed a\n",
      "man to look so perpetually as if something had disagreed with him. The look\n",
      "to be worn at the Birthplace was properly the beatific, and when once it\n",
      "had fairly been missed by those who took it for granted, who indeed paid\n",
      "sixpence for it--like the table-wine in provincial France it was\n",
      "_compris_--one would be sure to have news of the remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "News accordingly was what Gedge had been expecting--and what he knew, above\n",
      "all, had been expected by his wife, who had a way of sitting at present as\n",
      "with an ear for a certain knock. She didn't watch him, didn't follow him\n",
      "about the house, at the public hours, to spy upon his treachery; and that\n",
      "could touch him even though her averted eyes went through him more than her\n",
      "fixed. Her mistrust was so perfectly expressed by her manner of showing she\n",
      "trusted that he never felt so nervous, never tried so to keep straight, as\n",
      "when she most let him alone. When the crowd thickened and they had of\n",
      "necessity to receive together he tried himself to get off by allowing her\n",
      "as much as possible the word. When people appealed to him he turned to\n",
      "her--and with more of ceremony than their relation warranted: he couldn't\n",
      "help _this_ either, if it seemed ironic--as to the person most concerned or\n",
      "most competent. He flattered himself at these moments that no one would\n",
      "have guessed her being his wife; especially as to do her justice, she met\n",
      "his manner with a wonderful grim bravado--grim, so to say, for himself,\n",
      "grim by its outrageous cheerfulness for the simple-minded. The lore she\n",
      "_did_ produce for them, the associations of the sacred spot she developed,\n",
      "multiplied, embroidered; the things in short she said and the stupendous\n",
      "way she said them! She wasn't a bit ashamed, since why need virtue be ever\n",
      "ashamed? It was virtue, for it put bread into his mouth--he meanwhile on\n",
      "his side taking it out of hers. He had seen Grant-Jackson on the October\n",
      "day in the Birthplace itself--the right setting of course for such an\n",
      "interview; and what had occurred was that, precisely, when the scene had\n",
      "ended and he had come back to their own sitting-room, the question she put\n",
      "to him for information was: \"Have you settled it that I'm to starve?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had for a long time said nothing to him so straight--which was but a proof\n",
      "of her real anxiety; the straightness of Grant-Jackson's visit, following on the\n",
      "very slight sinuosity of a note shortly before received from him, made tension\n",
      "show for what it was. By this time, really, however, his decision had been\n",
      "taken; the minutes elapsing between his reappearance at the domestic fireside\n",
      "and his having, from the other threshold, seen Grant-Jackson's broad well-fitted\n",
      "back, the back of a banker and a patriot, move away, had, though few, presented\n",
      "themselves to him as supremely critical. They formed, as it were, the hinge of\n",
      "his door, that door actually ajar so as to show him a possible fate beyond it,\n",
      "but which, with his hand, in a spasm, thus tightening on the knob, he might\n",
      "either open wide or close partly or altogether. He stood at autumn dusk in the\n",
      "little museum that constituted the vestibule of the temple, and there, as with a\n",
      "concentrated push at the crank of a windlass, he brought himself round. The\n",
      "portraits on the walls seemed vaguely to watch for it; it was in their august\n",
      "presence--kept dimly august for the moment by Grant-Jackson's impressive check\n",
      "of his application of a match to the vulgar gas--that the great man had uttered,\n",
      "as if it said all, his \"You know, my dear fellow, really----!\" He had managed it\n",
      "with the special tact of a fat man, always, when there _was_ any, very fine;\n",
      "he had got the most out of the time, the place, the setting, all the little\n",
      "massed admonitions and symbols; confronted there with his victim on the spot\n",
      "that he took occasion to name afresh as, to _his_ piety and patriotism, the most\n",
      "sacred on earth, he had given it to be understood that in the first place he was\n",
      "lost in amazement and that in the second he expected a single warning now to\n",
      "suffice. Not to insist too much moreover on the question of gratitude, he would\n",
      "let his remonstrance rest, if need be, solely on the question of taste. _As_ a\n",
      "matter of taste alone----! But he was surely not to be obliged to follow that\n",
      "up. Poor Gedge indeed would have been sorry to oblige him, for he saw it was\n",
      "exactly to the atrocious taste of unthankfulness the allusion was made. When he\n",
      "said he wouldn't dwell on what the fortunate occupant of the post owed him for\n",
      "the stout battle originally fought on his behalf, he simply meant he _would_.\n",
      "That was his tact--which, with everything else that has been mentioned, in the\n",
      "scene, to help, really had the ground to itself. The day _had_ been when Gedge\n",
      "couldn't have thanked him enough--though he had thanked him, he considered,\n",
      "almost fulsomely--and nothing, nothing that he could coherently or reputably\n",
      "name, had happened since then. From the moment he was pulled up, in short, he\n",
      "had no case, and if he exhibited, instead of one, only hot tears in his eyes,\n",
      "the mystic gloom of the temple either prevented his friend from seeing them or\n",
      "rendered it possible that they stood for remorse. He had dried them, with the\n",
      "pads formed by the base of his bony thumbs, before he went in to Isabel. This\n",
      "was the more fortunate as, in spite of her inquiry, prompt and pointed, he but\n",
      "moved about the room looking at her hard. Then he stood before the fire a little\n",
      "with his hands behind him and his coat-tails divided, quite as the person in\n",
      "permanent possession. It was an indication his wife appeared to take in; but she\n",
      "put nevertheless presently another question. \"You object to telling me what he\n",
      "said?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He said 'You know, my dear fellow, really----!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is that all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Practically. Except that I'm a thankless beast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" she responded, not with dissent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean that I _am_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are those the words he used?\" she asked with a scruple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge continued to think. \"The words he used were that I give away the Show\n",
      "and that, from several sources, it has come round to Them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As of course a baby would have known!\" And then as her husband said\n",
      "nothing: \"Were _those_ the words he used?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Absolutely. He couldn't have used better ones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he call it,\" Mrs. Gedge inquired, \"the 'Show'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course he did. The Biggest on Earth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She winced, looking at him hard--she wondered, but only for a moment.\n",
      "\"Well, it _is_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it's something,\" Gedge went on, \"to have given _that_ away. But,\" he\n",
      "added, \"I've taken it back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean you've been convinced?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean I've been scared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At last, at last!\" she gratefully breathed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh it was easily done. It was only two words. But here I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face was now less hard for him. \"And what two words?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'You know, Mr. Gedge, that it simply won't do.' That was all. But it was\n",
      "the way such a man says them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad then,\" Mrs. Gedge frankly averred, \"that he _is_ such a man. How\n",
      "did you ever think it _could_ do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it was my critical sense. I didn't ever know I had one--till They\n",
      "came and (by putting me here) waked it up in me. Then I had somehow, don't\n",
      "you see? to live with it; and I seemed to feel that, with one thing and\n",
      "another, giving it time and in the long run, it might, it _ought_ to, come\n",
      "out on top of the heap. Now that's where, he says, it simply won't 'do.' So\n",
      "I must put it--I _have_ put it--at the bottom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very good place then for a critical sense!\" And Isabel, more placidly\n",
      "now, folded her work. \"_If_, that is, you can only keep it there. If it\n",
      "doesn't struggle up again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It can't struggle.\" He was still before the fire, looking round at the\n",
      "warm low room, peaceful in the lamplight, with the hum of the kettle for\n",
      "the ear, with the curtain drawn over the leaded casement, a short moreen\n",
      "curtain artfully chosen by Isabel for the effect of the olden time, its\n",
      "virtue of letting the light within show ruddy to the street. \"It's dead,\"\n",
      "he went on; \"I killed it just now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He really spoke so that she wondered. \"Just now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There in the other place--I strangled it, poor thing, in the dark. If\n",
      "you'll go out and see, there must be blood. Which, indeed,\" he added, \"on\n",
      "an altar of sacrifice, is all right. But the place is for ever spattered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to go out and see.\" She locked her hands over the needlework\n",
      "folded on her knee, and he knew, with her eyes on him, that a look he had\n",
      "seen before was in her face. \"You're off your head, you know, my dear, in a\n",
      "way.\" Then, however, more cheeringly: \"It's a good job it hasn't been too\n",
      "late.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too late to get it under?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too late for Them to give you the second chance that I thank God you\n",
      "accept.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if it _had_ been----!\" And he looked away as through the ruddy curtain\n",
      "and into the chill street. Then he faced her again. \"I've scarcely got over\n",
      "my fright yet. I mean,\" he went on, \"for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I mean for _you_. Suppose what you had come to announce to me now were\n",
      "that we had _got_ the sack. How should I enjoy, do you think, seeing you turn\n",
      "out? Yes, out _there_!\" she added as his eyes again moved from their little\n",
      "warm circle to the night of early winter on the other side of the pane, to\n",
      "the rare quick footsteps, to the closed doors, to the curtains drawn like\n",
      "their own, behind which the small flat town, intrinsically dull, was\n",
      "sitting down to supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stiffened himself as he warmed his back; he held up his head, shaking\n",
      "himself a little as if to shake the stoop out of his shoulders, but he had\n",
      "to allow she was right. \"What would have become of us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What indeed? We should have begged our bread--or I should be taking in\n",
      "washing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was silent a little. \"I'm too old. I should have begun sooner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh God forbid!\" she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The pinch,\" he pursued, \"is that I can do nothing else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing whatever!\" she agreed with elation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whereas here--if I cultivate it--I perhaps _can_ still lie. But I must\n",
      "cultivate it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh you old dear!\" And she got up to kiss him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do my best,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VII\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you remember us?\" the gentleman asked and smiled--with the lady beside\n",
      "him smiling too; speaking so much less as an earnest pilgrim or as a\n",
      "tiresome tourist than as an old acquaintance. It was history repeating\n",
      "itself as Gedge had somehow never expected, with almost everything the same\n",
      "except that the evening was now a mild April-end, except that the visitors\n",
      "had put off mourning and showed all their bravery--besides showing, as he\n",
      "doubtless did himself, though so differently, for a little older; except,\n",
      "above all, that--oh seeing them again suddenly affected him not a bit as\n",
      "the thing he'd have supposed it. \"We're in England again and we were near;\n",
      "I've a brother at Oxford with whom we've been spending a day, so that we\n",
      "thought we'd come over.\" This the young man pleasantly said while our\n",
      "friend took in the queer fact that he must himself seem to them rather\n",
      "coldly to gape. They had come in the same way at the quiet close; another\n",
      "August had passed, and this was the second spring; the Birthplace, given\n",
      "the hour, was about to suspend operations till the morrow; the last\n",
      "lingerer had gone and the fancy of the visitors was once more for a look\n",
      "round by themselves. This represented surely no greater presumption than\n",
      "the terms on which they had last parted with him seemed to warrant; so that\n",
      "if he did inconsequently stare it was just in fact because he was so\n",
      "supremely far from having forgotten them. But the sight of the pair luckily\n",
      "had a double effect, and the first precipitated the second--the second\n",
      "being really his sudden vision that everything perhaps depended for him on\n",
      "his recognising no complication. He must go straight on, since it was what\n",
      "had for more than a year now so handsomely answered; he must brazen it out\n",
      "consistently, since that only was what his dignity was at last reduced to.\n",
      "He mustn't be afraid in one way any more than he had been in another;\n",
      "besides which it came over him to the point of his flushing for it that\n",
      "their visit, in its essence, must have been for himself. It was good\n",
      "society again, and _they_ were the same. It wasn't for him therefore to\n",
      "behave as if he couldn't meet them.\n",
      "\n",
      "These deep vibrations, on Gedge's part, were as quick as they were deep;\n",
      "they came in fact all at once, so that his response, his declaration that\n",
      "it was all right--\"Oh _rather_; the hour doesn't matter for _you_!\"--had\n",
      "hung fire but an instant; and when they were well across the threshold and\n",
      "the door closed behind them, housed in the twilight of the temple, where,\n",
      "as before, the votive offerings glimmered on the walls, he drew the long\n",
      "breath of one who might by a self-betrayal have done something too\n",
      "dreadful. For what had brought them back was indubitably not the glamour of\n",
      "the shrine itself--since he had had a glimpse of their analysis of that\n",
      "quantity; but their critical (not to say their sentimental) interest in the\n",
      "queer case of the priest. Their call was the tribute of curiosity, of\n",
      "sympathy, of a compassion really, as such things went, exquisite--a tribute\n",
      "_to_ that queerness which entitled them to the frankest welcome. They had\n",
      "wanted, for the generous wonder of it, to judge how he was getting on, how\n",
      "such a man in such a place _could_; and they had doubtless more than\n",
      "half-expected to see the door opened by somebody who had succeeded him.\n",
      "Well, somebody _had_--only with a strange equivocation; as they would have,\n",
      "poor things, to make out themselves, an embarrassment for which he pitied\n",
      "them. Nothing could have been more odd, but verily it was this troubled\n",
      "vision of their possible bewilderment, and this compunctious view of such a\n",
      "return for their amenity, that practically determined in him his tone. The\n",
      "lapse of the months had but made their name familiar to him; they had on\n",
      "the other occasion inscribed it, among the thousand names, in the current\n",
      "public register, and he had since then, for reasons of his own, reasons of\n",
      "feeling, again and again turned back to it. It was nothing in itself; it\n",
      "told him nothing--\"Mr. and Mrs. B. D. Hayes, New York\"--one of those\n",
      "American labels that were just like every other American label and that\n",
      "were precisely the most remarkable thing about people reduced to achieving\n",
      "an identity in such other ways. They could be Mr. and Mrs. B. D. Hayes and\n",
      "yet could be, with all presumptions missing--well, what these callers were.\n",
      "It had quickly enough indeed cleared the situation a little further that\n",
      "his friends had absolutely, the other time, as it came back to him, warned\n",
      "him of his original danger, their anxiety about which had been the last\n",
      "note sounded among them. What he was afraid of, with this reminiscence, was\n",
      "that, finding him still safe, they would, the next thing, definitely\n",
      "congratulate him and perhaps even, no less candidly, ask him how he had\n",
      "managed. It was with the sense of nipping some such inquiry in the bud\n",
      "that, losing no time and holding himself with a firm grip, he began on the\n",
      "spot, downstairs, to make plain to them how he had managed. He routed the\n",
      "possibility of the question in short by the assurance of his answer. \"Yes,\n",
      "yes, I'm still here; I suppose it _is_ in a manner to one's profit that one\n",
      "does, such as it is, one's best.\" He did his best on the present occasion,\n",
      "did it with the gravest face he had ever worn and a soft serenity that was\n",
      "like a large damp sponge passed over their previous meeting--over\n",
      "everything in it, that is, but the fact of its pleasantness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We stand here, you see, in the old living-room, happily still to be\n",
      "reconstructed in the mind's eye, in spite of the havoc of time, which we\n",
      "have fortunately of late years been able to arrest. It was of course rude\n",
      "and humble, but it must have been snug and quaint, and we have at least the\n",
      "pleasure of knowing that the tradition in respect to the features that do\n",
      "remain is delightfully uninterrupted. Across that threshold He habitually\n",
      "passed; through those low windows, in childhood, He peered out into the\n",
      "world that He was to make so much happier by the gift to it of His genius;\n",
      "over the boards of this floor--that is over _some_ of them, for we mustn't\n",
      "be carried away!--his little feet often pattered; and the beams of this\n",
      "ceiling (we must really in some places take care of _our_ heads!) he\n",
      "endeavoured, in boyish strife, to jump up and touch. It's not often that in\n",
      "the early home of genius and renown the whole tenor of existence is laid so\n",
      "bare, not often that we are able to retrace, from point to point and from\n",
      "step to step, its connexion with objects, with influences--to build it\n",
      "round again with the little solid facts out of which it sprang. This\n",
      "therefore, I need scarcely remind you, is what makes the small space\n",
      "between these walls--so modest to measurement, so insignificant of\n",
      "aspect--unique on all the earth. _There's nothing like it_,\" Morris Gedge\n",
      "went on, insisting as solemnly and softly, for his bewildered hearers, as\n",
      "over a pulpit-edge; \"there's nothing at all like it anywhere in the world.\n",
      "There's nothing, only reflect, for the combination of greatness and, as we\n",
      "venture to say, of intimacy. You may find elsewhere perhaps absolutely\n",
      "fewer changes, but where shall you find a _Presence_ equally diffused,\n",
      "uncontested and undisturbed? Where in particular shall you find, on the\n",
      "part of the abiding spirit, an equally towering eminence? You may find\n",
      "elsewhere eminence of a considerable order, but where shall you find _with_\n",
      "it, don't you see, changes after all so few and the contemporary element\n",
      "caught so, as it were, in the very fact?\" His visitors, at first confounded\n",
      "but gradually spellbound, were still gaping with the universal\n",
      "gape--wondering, he judged, into what strange pleasantry he had been\n",
      "suddenly moved to explode, and yet beginning to see in him an intention\n",
      "beyond a joke, so that they started, at this point, they almost jumped,\n",
      "when, by as rapid a transition, he made, toward the old fireplace, a dash\n",
      "that seemed to illustrate precisely the act of eager catching. \"It is in\n",

      "if we could look close enough, we should find the hearth stone scraped with\n",

      "It was, he even himself felt at this moment, wonderfully done; no auditors,\n",

      "abruptly been perpetrated, the painful reality of which stayed itself\n",
      "before coming home--the visible effect on his friends in fine wound him up\n",
      "as to the sense that _they_ were worth the trick. It came of itself now--he\n",
      "had got it so by heart; but perhaps really it had never come so well, with\n",
      "the staleness so disguised, the interest so renewed and the clerical\n",
      "unction demanded by the priestly character so successfully distilled. Mr.\n",
      "Hayes of New York had more than once looked at his wife, and Mrs. Hayes of\n",

      "did it better than he had done anything else in life; with so high and\n",
      "broad an effect, in truth, an inspiration so rich and free, that his poor\n",

      "hadn't simply adopted another, a different perversity. There would be more\n",
      "than one fashion of giving away the Show, and wasn't _this_ perhaps a\n",
      "question of giving it away by excess? He could dish them by too much\n",
      "romance as well as by too little; she hadn't hitherto fairly grasped that\n",
      "there might _be_ too much. It was a way like another, at any rate, of\n",
      "reducing the place to the absurd; which reduction, if he didn't look out,\n",
      "would reduce _them_ again to the prospect of the streets, and this time\n",
      "surely without appeal. It all depended indeed--he knew she knew that--on\n",

      "take. He knew she knew what he himself held it would take--that he\n",

      "piled up, and so did every one else; wherefore if no one reported him as\n",
      "before why were They to be uneasy? It was in consequence of idiots tempted\n",

      "positive that the winds were now at rest. How could they be more so?--he\n",

      "Hayes were from New York, but it was a little like singing, as he had heard\n",
      "one of his Americans once say about something, to a Boston audience. He did\n",
      "none the less what he could, and it was ever his practice to stop still at\n",
      "a certain spot in the room and, after having secured attention by look and\n",
      "gesture, suddenly shoot off: \"Here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They always understood, the good people--he could fairly love them now for it;\n",
      "they always said breathlessly and unanimously \"There?\" and stared down at the\n",
      "designated point quite as if some trace of the grand event were still to be made\n",
      "out. This movement produced he again looked round. \"Consider it well: _the_ spot\n",
      "of earth----!\" \"Oh but it isn't _earth_!\" the boldest spirit--there was always a\n",
      "boldest--would generally pipe out. Then the guardian of the Birthplace would be\n",
      "truly superior--as if the unfortunate had figured the Immortal coming up, like a\n",
      "potato, through the soil. \"I'm not suggesting that He was born on the bare\n",
      "ground. He was born _here_!\"--with an uncompromising dig of his heel. \"There\n",
      "ought to be a brass, with an inscription, let in.\" \"Into the floor?\"--it always\n",
      "came. \"Birth and burial: seedtime, summer, autumn!\"--that always, with its\n",
      "special right cadence, thanks to his unfailing spring, came too. \"Why not as\n",
      "well as into the pavement of the church?--you've _seen_ our grand old church?\"\n",
      "The former of which questions nobody ever answered--abounding, on the other\n",
      "hand, to make up, in relation to the latter. Mr. and Mrs. Hayes even were at\n",
      "first left dumb by it--not indeed, to do them justice, having uttered the word\n",
      "that called for it. They had uttered no word while he kept the game up, and\n",
      "(though that made it a little more difficult) he could yet stand triumphant\n",
      "before them after he had finished with his flourish. Only then it was that Mr.\n",
      "Hayes of New York broke silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if we wanted to see I think I may say we're quite satisfied. As my\n",
      "wife says, it _would_ seem your line.\" He spoke now, visibly, with more\n",
      "ease, as if a light had come: though he made no joke of it, for a reason\n",
      "that presently appeared. They were coming down the little stair, and it was\n",
      "on the descent that his companion added her word.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know what we half _did_ think----?\" And then to her husband: \"Is it\n",
      "dreadful to tell him?\" They were in the room below, and the young woman,\n",
      "also relieved, expressed the feeling with gaiety. She smiled as before at\n",
      "Morris Gedge, treating him as a person with whom relations were possible,\n",
      "yet remaining just uncertain enough to invoke Mr. Hayes's opinion. \"We\n",
      "_have_ awfully wanted--from what we had heard.\" But she met her husband's\n",
      "graver face; he was not quite out of the wood. At this she was slightly\n",
      "flurried--but she cut it short. \"You must know--don't you?--that, with the\n",
      "crowds who listen to you, we'd have heard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked from one to the other, and once more again, with force, something\n",
      "came over him. They had kept him in mind, they were neither ashamed nor\n",
      "afraid to show it, and it was positively an interest on the part of this\n",
      "charming creature and this keen cautious gentleman, an interest resisting\n",
      "oblivion and surviving separation, that had governed their return. Their\n",
      "other visit had been the brightest thing that had ever happened to him, but\n",
      "this was the gravest; so that at the end of a minute something broke in him\n",
      "and his mask dropped of itself. He chucked, as he would have said,\n",
      "consistency; which, in its extinction, left the tears in his eyes. His\n",
      "smile was therefore queer. \"Heard how I'm going it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man, though still looking at him hard, felt sure, with this, of\n",
      "his own ground. \"Of course you're tremendously talked about. You've gone\n",
      "round the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've heard of me in America?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why almost of nothing else!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was what made us feel----!\" Mrs. Hayes contributed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you must see for yourselves?\" Again he compared, poor Gedge, their\n",
      "faces. \"Do you mean I excite--a--scandal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear no! Admiration. You renew so,\" the young man observed, \"the\n",
      "interest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah there it is!\" said Gedge with eyes of adventure that seemed to rest\n",
      "beyond the Atlantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They listen, month after month, when they're out here, as you must have\n",
      "seen; then they go home and talk. But they sing your praise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Our friend could scarce take it in. \"Over _there_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Over there. I think you must be even in the papers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Without abuse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh we don't abuse every one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hayes, in her beauty, it was clear, stretched the point. \"They rave\n",
      "about you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then they _don't_ know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nobody knows,\" the young man declared; \"it wasn't any one's knowledge, at\n",
      "any rate, that made us uneasy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was your own? I mean your own sense?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, call it that. We remembered, and we wondered what had happened. So,\"\n",
      "Mr. Hayes now frankly laughed, \"we came to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge stared through his film of tears. \"Came from America to see _me_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh a part of the way. But we wouldn't, in England, have missed you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now we _haven't_!\" the young woman soothingly added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge still could only gape at the candour of the tribute. But he tried to\n",
      "meet them--it was what was least poor for him--in their own key. \"Well, how\n",
      "do you like it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hayes, he thought--if their answer were important--laughed a little\n",
      "nervously. \"Oh you see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more he looked from one to the other. \"It's too beastly easy, you\n",
      "know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband raised his eyebrows. \"You conceal your art. The emotion--yes;\n",
      "that must be easy; the general tone must flow. But about your facts--you've\n",
      "so many: how do you get _them_ through?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge wondered. \"You think I get too many----?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this they were amused together. \"That's just what we came to see!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you know, I've felt my way; I've gone step by step; you wouldn't\n",
      "believe how I've tried it on. _This_--where you see me--is where I've come\n",
      "out.\" After which, as they said nothing: \"You hadn't thought I _could_ come\n",
      "out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again they just waited, but the husband spoke: \"Are you so awfully sure you\n",
      "are out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge drew himself up in the manner of his moments of emotion, almost\n",
      "conscious even that, with his sloping shoulders, his long lean neck and his\n",
      "nose so prominent in proportion to other matters, he resembled the more a\n",
      "giraffe. It was now at last he really caught on. \"I _may_ be in danger\n",
      "again--and the danger is what has moved you? Oh!\" the poor man fairly\n",
      "moaned. His appreciation of it quite weakened him, yet he pulled himself\n",
      "together. \"You've your view of my danger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was wondrous how, with that note definitely sounded, the air was\n",
      "cleared. Lucid Mr. Hayes, at the end of a minute, had put the thing in a\n",
      "nutshell. \"I don't know what you'll think of us--for being so beastly\n",
      "curious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think,\" poor Gedge grimaced, \"you're only too beastly kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all your own fault,\" his friend returned, \"for presenting us (who are\n",
      "not idiots, say) with so striking a picture of a crisis. At our other\n",
      "visit, you remember,\" he smiled, \"you created an anxiety for the opposite\n",
      "reason. Therefore if _this_ should again be a crisis for you, you'd really\n",
      "give us the case with an ideal completeness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You make me wish,\" said Morris Gedge, \"that it might be one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, don't try--for our amusement--to bring one on. I don't see, you\n",
      "know, how you can have much margin. Take care--take care.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge did it pensive justice. \"Yes, that was what you said a year ago. You\n",
      "did me the honour to be uneasy--as my wife was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which determined on the young woman's part an immediate question. \"May I\n",
      "ask then if Mrs. Gedge is now at rest?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--since you do ask. _She_ fears at least that I go too far; she doesn't\n",
      "believe in my margin. You see we _had_ our scare after your visit. They\n",
      "came down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His friends were all interest. \"Ah! They came down?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heavy. They brought _me_ down. That's _why_--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why you _are_ down?\" Mrs. Hayes sweetly demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah but my dear man,\" her husband interposed, \"you're not down; you're\n",
      "_up_! You're only up a different tree, but you're up at the tip-top.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean I take it too high?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's exactly the question,\" the young man answered; \"and the\n",
      "possibility, as matching your first danger, is just what we felt we\n",
      "couldn't, if you didn't mind, miss the measure of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge gazed at him. \"I feel that I know what you at bottom _hoped_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We at bottom 'hope,' surely, that you're all right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In spite of the fool it makes of every one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hayes of New York smiled. \"Say _because_ of that. We only ask to\n",
      "believe every one _is_ a fool!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only you haven't been, without reassurance, able to imagine fools of the\n",
      "size that my case demands?\" And Gedge had a pause while, as if on the\n",
      "chance of some proof, his companion waited. \"Well, I won't pretend to you\n",
      "that your anxiety hasn't made me, doesn't threaten to make me, a bit\n",
      "nervous; though I don't quite understand it if, as you say, people but rave\n",
      "about me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh _that_ report was from the other side; people in our country so very\n",
      "easily rave. You've seen small children laugh to shrieks when tickled in a\n",
      "new place. So there are amiable millions with us who are but small\n",
      "shrieking children. They perpetually present new places for the tickler.\n",
      "What we've seen in further lights,\" Mr. Hayes good-humouredly pursued, \"is\n",
      "your people _here_--the Committee, the Board, or whatever the powers to\n",
      "whom you're responsible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Call them my friend Grant-Jackson then--my original backer, though I admit\n",
      "for that reason perhaps my most formidable critic. It's with him\n",
      "practically I deal; or rather it's by him I'm dealt with--_was_ dealt with\n",
      "before. I stand or fall by him. But he has given me my head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mayn't he then want you,\" Mrs. Hayes inquired, \"just to show as flagrantly\n",
      "running away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course--I see what you mean. I'm riding, blindly, for a fall, and\n",
      "They're watching (to be tender of me!) for the smash that may come of\n",
      "itself. It's Machiavellic--but everything's possible. And what did you just\n",
      "now mean,\" Gedge asked--\"especially if you've only heard of my\n",
      "prosperity--by your 'further lights'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His friends for an instant looked embarrassed, but Mr. Hayes came to the\n",
      "point. \"We've heard of your prosperity, but we've also, remember, within a\n",
      "few minutes, heard _you_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was determined you _should_,\" said Gedge. \"I'm good then--but I overdo?\"\n",
      "His strained grin was still sceptical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus challenged, at any rate, his visitor pronounced. \"Well, if you don't;\n",
      "if at the end of six months more it's clear that you haven't overdone;\n",
      "then, _then_----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it's great.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it _is_ great--greater than anything of the sort ever was. I overdo,\n",
      "thank goodness, yes; or I would if it were a thing you _could_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh well, if there's _proof_ that you can't----!\" With which and an\n",
      "expressive gesture Mr. Hayes threw up his fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife, however, for a moment seemed unable to let them go. \"Don't They\n",
      "want then _any_ truth?--none even for the mere look of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The look of it,\" said Morris Gedge, \"is what I give!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It made them, the others, exchange a look of their own. Then she smiled.\n",
      "\"Oh, well, if they think so----!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You at least don't? You're like my wife--which indeed, I remember,\" Gedge\n",
      "added, \"is a similarity I expressed a year ago the wish for! At any rate I\n",
      "frighten _her_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young husband, with an \"Ah wives are terrible!\" smoothed it over, and\n",
      "their visit would have failed of further excuse had not at this instant a\n",
      "movement at the other end of the room suddenly engaged them. The evening\n",
      "had so nearly closed in, though Gedge, in the course of their talk, had\n",
      "lighted the lamp nearest them, that they had not distinguished, in\n",
      "connexion with the opening of the door of communication to the warden's\n",
      "lodge, the appearance of another person, an eager woman who in her\n",
      "impatience had barely paused before advancing. Mrs. Gedge--her identity\n",
      "took but a few seconds to become vivid--was upon them, and she had not been\n",
      "too late for Mr. Hayes's last remark. Gedge saw at once that she had come\n",
      "with news; no need even, for that certitude, of her quick retort to the\n",
      "words in the air--\"You may say as well, sir, that they're often, poor\n",
      "wives, terrified!\" She knew nothing of the friends whom, at so unnatural an\n",
      "hour, he was showing about; but there was no livelier sign for him that\n",
      "this didn't matter than the possibility with which she intensely charged\n",
      "her \"Grant-Jackson, to see you at once!\"--letting it, so to speak, fly in\n",
      "his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has been with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only a minute--he's there. But it's you he wants to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the others. \"And what does he want, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God knows! There it is. It's his horrid hour--it _was_ that other time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had nervously turned to the others, overflowing to them, in her dismay,\n",
      "for all their strangeness--quite, as he said to himself, like a woman of\n",
      "the people. She was the bareheaded good wife talking in the street about\n",
      "the row in the house, and it was in this character that he instantly\n",
      "introduced her: \"My dear doubting wife, who will do her best to entertain\n",
      "you while I wait upon our friend.\" And he explained to her as he could his\n",
      "now protesting companions--\"Mr. and Mrs. Hayes of New York, who have been\n",
      "here before.\" He knew, without knowing why, that her announcement chilled\n",
      "him; he failed at least to see why it should chill him so much. His good\n",
      "friends had themselves been visibly affected by it, and heaven knew that\n",
      "the depths of brooding fancy in him were easily stirred by contact. If they\n",
      "had wanted a crisis they accordingly had found one, albeit they had already\n",
      "asked leave to retire before it. This he wouldn't have. \"Ah no, you must\n",
      "really see!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we shan't be able to bear it, you know,\" said the young woman, \"if it\n",
      "_is_ to turn you out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her crudity attested her sincerity, and it was the latter, doubtless, that\n",
      "instantly held Mrs. Gedge. \"It _is_ to turn us out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has he told you that, madam?\" Mr. Hayes inquired of her--it being wondrous\n",
      "how the breath of doom had drawn them together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not told me; but there's something in him there--I mean in his awful\n",
      "manner--that matches too well with other things. We've seen,\" said the poor\n",
      "pale lady, \"other things enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young woman almost clutched her. \"Is his manner very awful?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's simply the manner,\" Gedge interposed, \"of a very great man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, very great men,\" said his wife, \"are very awful things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's exactly,\" he laughed, \"what we're finding out! But I mustn't keep him\n",
      "waiting. Our friends here,\" he went on, \"are directly interested. You\n",
      "mustn't, mind you, let them go until we know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hayes, however, held him; he found himself stayed. \"We're so directly\n",
      "interested that I want you to understand this. If anything happens----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes?\" said Gedge, all gentle as he faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, _we_ must set you up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hayes quickly abounded. \"Oh _do_ come to us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he could but take them in. They were really wonderful folk. And with\n",
      "it all but Mr. and Mrs. Hayes! It affected even Isabel through her alarm;\n",
      "though the balm, in a manner, seemed to foretell the wound. He had reached\n",
      "the threshold of his own quarters; he stood there as at the door of the\n",
      "chamber of judgement. But he laughed; at least he could be gallant in going\n",
      "up for sentence. \"Very good then--I'll come to you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was very well, but it didn't prevent his heart, a minute later, at the\n",
      "end of the passage, from thumping with beats he could count. He had paused\n",
      "again before going in; on the other side of this second door his poor\n",
      "future was to be let loose at him. It was broken, at best, and spiritless,\n",
      "but wasn't Grant-Jackson there like a beast-tamer in a cage, all tights and\n",
      "spangles and circus attitudes, to give it a cut with the smart official\n",
      "whip and make it spring at him? It was during this moment that he fully\n",
      "measured the effect for his nerves of the impression made on his so oddly\n",
      "earnest friends--whose earnestness he verily, in the spasm of this last\n",
      "effort, came within an ace of resenting. They had upset him by contact; he\n",
      "was afraid literally of meeting his doom on his knees; it wouldn't have\n",
      "taken much more, he absolutely felt, to make him approach with his forehead\n",
      "in the dust the great man whose wrath was to be averted. Mr. and Mrs. Hayes\n",
      "of New York had brought tears to his eyes, but was it to be reserved for\n",
      "Grant-Jackson to make him cry like a baby? He wished, yes, while he\n",
      "palpitated, that Mr. and Mrs. Hayes of New York hadn't had such an\n",
      "eccentricity of interest, for it seemed somehow to come from _them_ that he\n",
      "was going so fast to pieces. Before he turned the knob of the door,\n",
      "however, he had another queer instant; making out that it had been,\n",
      "strictly, his case that was interesting, his funny power, however\n",
      "accidental, to show as in a picture the attitude of others--not his poor\n",
      "pale personality. It was this latter quantity, none the less, that was\n",
      "marching to execution. It is to our friend's credit that he _believed_, as\n",
      "he prepared to turn the knob, that he was going to be hanged; and it's\n",
      "certainly not less to his credit that his wife, on the chance, had his\n",
      "supreme thought. Here it was that--possibly with his last articulate\n",
      "breath--he thanked his stars, such as they were, for Mr. and Mrs. Hayes of\n",
      "New York. At least they would take care of her.\n",

      "Intending to sail for America in the early part of June, I determined to\r\n",
      "spend the interval of six weeks in England, to which country my mind's\r\n",
      "eye only had as yet been introduced. I had formed in Italy and France a\r\n",
      "resolute preference for old inns, considering that what they sometimes\r\n",
      "cost the ungratified body they repay the delighted mind. On my arrival\r\n",
      "in London, therefore, I lodged at a certain antique hostelry, much\r\n",
      "to the east of Temple Bar, deep in the quarter that I had inevitably\r\n",
      "figured as the Johnsonian. Here, on the first evening of my stay, I\r\n",
      "descended to the little coffee-room and bespoke my dinner of the genius\r\n",
      "of \"attendance\" in the person of the solitary waiter. No sooner had\r\n",
      "I crossed the threshold of this retreat than I felt I had cut a\r\n",
      "golden-ripe crop of English \"impressions.\" The coffee-room of the Red\r\n",
      "Lion, like so many other places and things I was destined to see in the\r\n",
      "motherland, seemed to have been waiting for long years, with just that\r\n",
      "sturdy sufferance of time written on its visage, for me to come and\r\n",
      "extract the romantic essence of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The latent preparedness of the American mind even for the most\r\n",
      "characteristic features of English life was a matter I meanwhile failed\r\n",
      "to get to the bottom of. The roots of it are indeed so deeply buried\r\n",
      "in the soil of our early culture that, without some great upheaval\r\n",
      "of feeling, we are at a loss to say exactly when and where and how it\r\n",
      "begins. It makes an American's enjoyment of England an emotion more\r\n",
      "searching than anything Continental. I had seen the coffee-room of\r\n",
      "the Red Lion years ago, at home--at Saragossa Illinois--in books, in\r\n",
      "visions, in dreams, in Dickens, in Smollett, in Boswell. It was small\r\n",
      "and subdivided into six narrow compartments by a series of perpendicular\r\n",
      "screens of mahogany, something higher than a man's stature, furnished\r\n",
      "on either side with a meagre uncushioned ledge, denominated in ancient\r\n",
      "Britain a seat. In each of these rigid receptacles was a narrow table--a\r\n",
      "table expected under stress to accommodate no less than four pairs of\r\n",
      "active British elbows. High pressure indeed had passed away from the\r\n",
      "Red Lion for ever. It now knew only that of memories and ghosts and\r\n",
      "atmosphere. Round the room there marched, breast-high, a magnificent\r\n",
      "panelling of mahogany, so dark with time and so polished with unremitted\r\n",
      "friction that by gazing a while into its lucid blackness I made out\r\n",
      "the dim reflexion of a party of wigged gentlemen in knee-breeches just\r\n",
      "arrived from York by the coach. On the dark yellow walls, coated by\r\n",
      "the fumes of English coal, of English mutton, of Scotch whiskey, were a\r\n",
      "dozen melancholy prints, sallow-toned with age--the Derby favourite of\r\n",
      "the year 1807, the Bank of England, her Majesty the Queen. On the floor\r\n",
      "was a Turkey carpet--as old as the mahogany almost, as the Bank\r\n",
      "of England, as the Queen--into which the waiter had in his lonely\r\n",
      "revolutions trodden so many massive soot-flakes and drops of overflowing\r\n",
      "beer that the glowing looms of Smyrna would certainly not have\r\n",
      "recognised it. To say that I ordered my dinner of this archaic type\r\n",
      "would be altogether to misrepresent the process owing to which, having\r\n",
      "dreamed of lamb and spinach and a salade de saison, I sat down in\r\n",
      "penitence to a mutton-chop and a rice pudding. Bracing my feet against\r\n",
      "the cross-beam of my little oaken table, I opposed to the mahogany\r\n",
      "partition behind me the vigorous dorsal resistance that must have\r\n",
      "expressed the old-English idea of repose. The sturdy screen refused even\r\n",
      "to creak, but my poor Yankee joints made up the deficiency.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I was waiting there for my chop there came into the room a person\r\n",
      "whom, after I had looked at him a moment, I supposed to be a fellow\r\n",
      "lodger and probably the only one. He seemed, like myself, to have\r\n",
      "submitted to proposals for dinner; the table on the other side of my\r\n",
      "partition had been prepared to receive him. He walked up to the fire,\r\n",
      "exposed his back to it and, after consulting his watch, looked directly\r\n",
      "out of the window and indirectly at me. He was a man of something less\r\n",
      "than middle age and more than middle stature, though indeed you would\r\n",
      "have called him neither young nor tall. He was chiefly remarkable for\r\n",
      "his emphasised leanness. His hair, very thin on the summit of his head,\r\n",
      "was dark short and fine. His eye was of a pale turbid grey, unsuited,\r\n",
      "perhaps, to his dark hair and well-drawn brows, but not altogether out\r\n",
      "of harmony with his colourless bilious complexion. His nose was aquiline\r\n",
      "and delicate; beneath it his moustache languished much rather than\r\n",
      "bristled. His mouth and chin were negative, or at the most provisional;\r\n",
      "not vulgar, doubtless, but ineffectually refined. A cold fatal\r\n",
      "gentlemanly weakness was expressed indeed in his attenuated person. His\r\n",
      "eye was restless and deprecating; his whole physiognomy, his manner of\r\n",
      "shifting his weight from foot to foot, the spiritless droop of his head,\r\n",
      "told of exhausted intentions, of a will relaxed. His dress was neat and\r\n",
      "\"toned down\"--he might have been in mourning. I made up my mind on three\r\n",
      "points: he was a bachelor, he was out of health, he was not indigenous\r\n",
      "to the soil. The waiter approached him, and they conversed in accents\r\n",
      "barely audible. I heard the words \"claret,\" \"sherry\" with a tentative\r\n",
      "inflexion, and finally \"beer\" with its last letter changed to \"ah.\"\r\n",
      "Perhaps he was a Russian in reduced circumstances; he reminded me\r\n",
      "slightly of certain sceptical cosmopolite Russians whom I had met on the\r\n",
      "Continent. While in my extravagant way I followed this train--for\r\n",
      "you see I was interested--there appeared a short brisk man with\r\n",
      "reddish-brown hair, with a vulgar nose, a sharp blue eye and a red\r\n",
      "beard confined to his lower jaw and chin. My putative Russian, still in\r\n",
      "possession of the rug, let his mild gaze stray over the dingy ornaments\r\n",
      "of the room. The other drew near, and his umbrella dealt a playful\r\n",
      "poke at the concave melancholy waistcoat. \"A penny ha'penny for your\r\n",
      "thoughts!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My friend, as I call him, uttered an exclamation, stared, then laid\r\n",
      "his two hands on the other's shoulders. The latter looked round at me\r\n",
      "keenly, compassing me in a momentary glance. I read in its own vague\r\n",
      "light that this was a transatlantic eyebeam; and with such confidence\r\n",
      "that I hardly needed to see its owner, as he prepared, with his\r\n",
      "companion, to seat himself at the table adjoining my own, take from his\r\n",
      "overcoat-pocket three New York newspapers and lay them beside his\r\n",
      "plate. As my neighbours proceeded to dine I felt the crumbs of their\r\n",
      "conversation scattered pretty freely abroad. I could hear almost all\r\n",
      "they said, without straining to catch it, over the top of the partition\r\n",
      "that divided us. Occasionally their voices dropped to recovery of\r\n",
      "discretion, but the mystery pieced itself together as if on purpose to\r\n",
      "entertain me. Their speech was pitched in the key that may in English\r\n",
      "air be called alien in spite of a few coincidences. The voices were\r\n",
      "American, however, with a difference; and I had no hesitation in\r\n",
      "assigning the softer and clearer sound to the pale thin gentleman, whom\r\n",
      "I decidedly preferred to his comrade. The latter began to question him\r\n",
      "about his voyage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Horrible, horrible! I was deadly sick from the hour we left New York.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you do look considerably reduced,\" said the second-comer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Reduced! I've been on the verge of the grave. I haven't slept six hours\r\n",
      "for three weeks.\" This was said with great gravity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I've made the voyage for the last time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The plague you have! You mean to locate here permanently?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it won't be so very permanent!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a pause; after which: \"You're the same merry old boy, Searle.\r\n",
      "Going to give up the ghost to-morrow, eh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I almost wish I were.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're not so sweet on England then? I've heard people say at home that\r\n",
      "you dress and talk and act like an Englishman. But I know these people\r\n",
      "here and I know you. You're not one of this crowd, Clement Searle, not\r\n",
      "you. You'll go under here, sir; you'll go under as sure as my name's\r\n",
      "Simmons.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Following this I heard a sudden clatter as of the drop of a knife and\r\n",
      "fork. \"Well, you're a delicate sort of creature, if it IS your ugly\r\n",
      "name! I've been wandering about all day in this accursed city, ready\r\n",
      "to cry with homesickness and heartsickness and every possible sort of\r\n",
      "sickness, and thinking, in the absence of anything better, of meeting\r\n",
      "you here this evening and of your uttering some sound of cheer and\r\n",
      "comfort and giving me some glimmer of hope. Go under? Ain't I under now?\r\n",
      "I can't do more than get under the ground!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Simmons's superior brightness appeared to flicker a moment in this\r\n",
      "gust of despair, but the next it was burning steady again. \"DON'T 'cry,'\r\n",
      "Searle,\" I heard him say. \"Remember the waiter. I've grown Englishman\r\n",
      "enough for that. For heaven's sake don't let's have any nerves. Nerves\r\n",
      "won't do anything for you here. It's best to come to the point. Tell me\r\n",
      "in three words what you expect of me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I heard another movement, as if poor Searle had collapsed in his\r\n",
      "chair. \"Upon my word, sir, you're quite inconceivable. You never got my\r\n",
      "letter?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I got your letter. I was never sorrier to get anything in my\r\n",
      "life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this declaration Mr. Searle rattled out an oath, which it was well\r\n",
      "perhaps that I but partially heard. \"Abijah Simmons,\" he then cried,\r\n",
      "\"what demon of perversity possesses you? Are you going to betray me here\r\n",
      "in a foreign land, to turn out a false friend, a heartless rogue?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go on, sir,\" said sturdy Simmons. \"Pour it all out. I'll wait till\r\n",
      "you've done. Your beer's lovely,\" he observed independently to the\r\n",
      "waiter. \"I'll have some more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For God's sake explain yourself!\" his companion appealed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a pause, at the end of which I heard Mr. Simmons set down his\r\n",
      "empty tankard with emphasis. \"You poor morbid mooning man,\" he resumed,\r\n",
      "\"I don't want to say anything to make you feel sore. I regularly pity\r\n",
      "you. But you must allow that you've acted more like a confirmed crank\r\n",
      "than a member of our best society--in which every one's so sensible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle seemed to have made an effort to compose himself. \"Be so good\r\n",
      "as to tell me then what was the meaning of your letter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you had got on MY nerves, if you want to know, when I wrote it.\r\n",
      "It came of my always wishing so to please folks. I had much better have\r\n",
      "let you alone. To tell you the plain truth I never was so horrified in\r\n",
      "my life as when I found that on the strength of my few kind words you\r\n",
      "had come out here to seek your fortune.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What then did you expect me to do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I expected you to wait patiently till I had made further enquiries and\r\n",
      "had written you again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you've made further enquiries now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Enquiries! I've committed assaults.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you find I've no claim?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No claim that one of THESE big bugs will look at. It struck me at first\r\n",
      "that you had rather a neat little case. I confess the look of it took\r\n",
      "hold of me--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thanks to your liking so to please folks!\" Mr. Simmons appeared for\r\n",
      "a moment at odds with something; it proved to be with his liquor. \"I\r\n",
      "rather think your beer's too good to be true,\" he said to the waiter. \"I\r\n",
      "guess I'll take water. Come, old man,\" he resumed, \"don't challenge me\r\n",
      "to the arts of debate, or you'll have me right down on you, and then you\r\n",
      "WILL feel me. My native sweetness, as I say, was part of it. The idea\r\n",
      "that if I put the thing through it would be a very pretty feather in\r\n",
      "my cap and a very pretty penny in my purse was part of it. And the\r\n",
      "satisfaction of seeing a horrid low American walk right into an old\r\n",
      "English estate was a good deal of it. Upon my word, Searle, when I think\r\n",
      "of it I wish with all my heart that, extravagant vain man as you are, I\r\n",
      "COULD, for the charm of it, put you through! I should hardly care what\r\n",
      "you did with the blamed place when you got it. I could leave you alone\r\n",
      "to turn it into Yankee notions--into ducks and drakes as they call 'em\r\n",
      "here. I should like to see you tearing round over it and kicking up its\r\n",
      "sacred dust in their very faces!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't know me one little bit,\" said Mr. Searle, rather shirking,\r\n",
      "I thought, the burden of this tribute and for all response to the\r\n",
      "ambiguity of the compliment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should be very glad to think I didn't, sir. I've been to no small\r\n",
      "amount of personal inconvenience for you. I've pushed my way right up\r\n",
      "to the headspring. I've got the best opinion that's to be had. The best\r\n",
      "opinion that's to be had just gives you one leer over its spectacles. I\r\n",
      "guess that look will fix you if you ever get it straight. I've been\r\n",
      "able to tap, indirectly,\" Mr. Simmons went on, \"the solicitor of your\r\n",
      "usurping cousin, and he evidently knows something to be in the wind. It\r\n",
      "seems your elder brother twenty years ago put out a feeler. So you're\r\n",
      "not to have the glory of even making them sit up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I never made any one sit up,\" I heard Mr. Searle plead. \"I shouldn't\r\n",
      "begin at this time of day. I should approach the subject like a\r\n",
      "gentleman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if you want very much to do something like a gentleman you've got\r\n",
      "a capital chance. Take your disappointment like a gentleman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had finished my dinner and had become keenly interested in poor Mr.\r\n",
      "Searle's unencouraging--or unencouraged--claim; so interested that I\r\n",
      "at last hated to hear his trouble reflected in his voice without being\r\n",
      "able--all respectfully!--to follow it in his face. I left my place, went\r\n",
      "over to the fire, took up the evening paper and established a post of\r\n",
      "observation behind it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His cold counsellor was in the act of choosing a soft chop from the\r\n",
      "dish--an act accompanied by a great deal of prying and poking with that\r\n",
      "gentleman's own fork. My disillusioned compatriot had pushed away his\r\n",
      "plate; he sat with his elbows on the table, gloomily nursing his head\r\n",
      "with his hands. His companion watched him and then seemed to wonder--to\r\n",
      "do Mr. Simmons justice--how he could least ungracefully give him up.\r\n",
      "\"I say, Searle,\"--and for my benefit, I think, taking me for a native\r\n",
      "ingenuous enough to be dazzled by his wit, he lifted his voice a little\r\n",
      "and gave it an ironical ring--\"in this country it's the inestimable\r\n",
      "privilege of a loyal citizen, under whatsoever stress of pleasure or of\r\n",
      "pain, to make a point of eating his dinner.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle gave his plate another push. \"Anything may happen now. I\r\n",
      "don't care a straw.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You ought to care. Have another chop and you WILL care. Have some\r\n",
      "better tipple. Take my advice!\" Mr. Simmons went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My friend--I adopt that name for him--gazed from between his two hands\r\n",
      "coldly before him. \"I've had enough of your advice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A little more,\" said Simmons mildly; \"I shan't trouble you again. What\r\n",
      "do you mean to do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing, nothing, nothing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing but starve. How about meeting expenses?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do you ask?\" said my friend. \"You don't care.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear fellow, if you want to make me offer you twenty pounds you set\r\n",
      "most clumsily about it. You said just now I don't know you,\" Mr. Simmons\r\n",
      "went on. \"Possibly. Come back with me then,\" he said kindly enough, \"and\r\n",
      "let's improve our acquaintance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I won't go back. I shall never go back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Simmons thought it shrewdly over. \"Well, you ARE sick!\" he exclaimed\r\n",
      "presently. \"All I can say is that if you're working out a plan for cold\r\n",
      "poison, or for any other act of desperation, you had better give it\r\n",
      "right up. You can't get a dose of the commonest kind of cold poison\r\n",
      "for nothing, you know. Look here, Searle\"--and the worthy man made what\r\n",
      "struck me as a very decent appeal. \"If you'll consent to return home\r\n",
      "with me by the steamer of the twenty-third I'll pay your passage down.\r\n",
      "More than that, I'll pay for your beer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My poor gentleman met it. \"I believe I never made up my mind to anything\r\n",
      "before, but I think it's made up now. I shall stay here till I take my\r\n",
      "departure for a newer world than any patched-up newness of ours. It's an\r\n",
      "odd feeling--I rather like it! What should I do at home?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You said just now you were homesick.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I meant I was sick for a home. Don't I belong here? Haven't I longed to\r\n",
      "get here all my life? Haven't I counted the months and the years till I\r\n",
      "should be able to 'go' as we say? And now that I've 'gone,' that is that\r\n",
      "I've come, must I just back out? No, no, I'll move on. I'm much obliged\r\n",
      "to you for your offer. I've enough money for the present. I've about my\r\n",
      "person some forty pounds' worth of British gold, and the same amount,\r\n",
      "say, of the toughness of the heaven-sent idiot. They'll see me through\r\n",
      "together! After they're gone I shall lay my head in some English\r\n",
      "churchyard, beside some ivied tower, beneath an old gnarled black yew.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had so far distinctly followed the dialogue; but at this point the\r\n",
      "landlord entered and, begging my pardon, would suggest that number 12,\r\n",
      "a most superior apartment, having now been vacated, it would give him\r\n",
      "pleasure if I would look in. I declined to look in, but agreed for\r\n",
      "number 12 at a venture and gave myself again, with dissimulation, to\r\n",
      "my friends. They had got up; Simmons had put on his overcoat; he stood\r\n",
      "polishing his rusty black hat with his napkin. \"Do you mean to go down\r\n",
      "to the place?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Possibly. I've thought of it so often that I should like to see it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shall you call on Mr. Searle?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heaven forbid!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Something has just occurred to me,\" Simmons pursued with a grin that\r\n",
      "made his upper lip look more than ever denuded by the razor and jerked\r\n",
      "the ugly ornament of his chin into the air. \"There's a certain Miss\r\n",
      "Searle, the old man's sister.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\" my gentleman quavered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, sir!--you talk of moving on. You might move on the damsel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle frowned in silence and his companion gave him a tap on the\r\n",
      "stomach. \"Line those ribs a bit first!\" He blushed crimson; his eyes\r\n",
      "filled with tears. \"You ARE a coarse brute,\" he said. The scene\r\n",
      "quite harrowed me, but I was prevented from seeing it through by the\r\n",
      "reappearance of the landlord on behalf of number 12. He represented to\r\n",
      "me that I ought in justice to him to come and see how tidy they HAD\r\n",
      "made it. Half an hour afterwards I was rattling along in a hansom toward\r\n",
      "Covent Garden, where I heard Madame Bosio in The Barber of Seville. On\r\n",
      "my return from the opera I went into the coffee-room; it had occurred\r\n",
      "to me I might catch there another glimpse of Mr. Searle. I was not\r\n",
      "disappointed. I found him seated before the fire with his head sunk on\r\n",
      "his breast: he slept, dreaming perhaps of Abijah Simmons. I watched him\r\n",
      "for some moments. His closed eyes, in the dim lamplight, looked even\r\n",
      "more helpless and resigned, and I seemed to see the fine grain of his\r\n",
      "nature in his unconscious mask. They say fortune comes while we sleep,\r\n",
      "and, standing there, I felt really tender enough--though otherwise most\r\n",
      "unqualified--to be poor Mr. Searle's fortune. As I walked away I noted\r\n",
      "in one of the little prandial pews I have described the melancholy\r\n",
      "waiter, whose whiskered chin also reposed on the bulge of his\r\n",
      "shirt-front. I lingered a moment beside the old inn-yard in which, upon\r\n",
      "a time, the coaches and post-chaises found space to turn and disgorge.\r\n",
      "Above the dusky shaft of the enclosing galleries, where lounging lodgers\r\n",
      "and crumpled chambermaids and all the picturesque domesticity of a\r\n",
      "rattling tavern must have leaned on their elbows for many a year, I made\r\n",
      "out the far-off lurid twinkle of the London constellations. At the foot\r\n",
      "of the stairs, enshrined in the glittering niche of her well-appointed\r\n",
      "bar, the landlady sat napping like some solemn idol amid votive brass\r\n",
      "and plate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next morning, not finding the subject of my benevolent curiosity in\r\n",
      "the coffee-room, I learned from the waiter that he had ordered breakfast\r\n",
      "in bed. Into this asylum I was not yet prepared to pursue him. I spent\r\n",
      "the morning in the streets, partly under pressure of business, but\r\n",
      "catching all kinds of romantic impressions by the way. To the searching\r\n",
      "American eye there is no tint of association with which the great grimy\r\n",
      "face of London doesn't flush. As the afternoon approached, however,\r\n",
      "I began to yearn for some site more gracefully classic than what\r\n",
      "surrounded me, and, thinking over the excursions recommended to the\r\n",
      "ingenuous stranger, decided to take the train to Hampton Court. The day\r\n",
      "was the more propitious that it yielded just that dim subaqueous light\r\n",
      "which sleeps so fondly upon the English landscape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the end of an hour I found myself wandering through the apartments of\r\n",
      "the great palace. They follow each other in infinite succession, with no\r\n",
      "great variety of interest or aspect, but with persistent pomp and a fine\r\n",
      "specific effect. They are exactly of their various times. You pass from\r\n",
      "painted and panelled bedchambers and closets, anterooms, drawing-rooms,\r\n",
      "council-rooms, through king's suite, queen's suite, prince's suite,\r\n",
      "until you feel yourself move through the appointed hours and stages\r\n",
      "of some rigid monarchical day. On one side are the old monumental\r\n",
      "upholsteries, the big cold tarnished beds and canopies, with the\r\n",
      "circumference of disapparelled royalty symbolised by a gilded\r\n",
      "balustrade, and the great carved and yawning chimney-places where\r\n",
      "dukes-in-waiting may have warmed their weary heels; on the other,\r\n",
      "in deep recesses, rise the immense windows, the framed and draped\r\n",
      "embrasures where the sovereign whispered and favourites smiled, looking\r\n",
      "out on terraced gardens and misty park. The brown walls are dimly\r\n",
      "illumined by innumerable portraits of courtiers and captains, more\r\n",
      "especially with various members of the Batavian entourage of William\r\n",
      "of Orange, the restorer of the palace; with good store too of the\r\n",
      "lily-bosomed models of Lely and Kneller. The whole tone of this\r\n",
      "processional interior is singularly stale and sad. The tints of all\r\n",
      "things have both faded and darkened--you taste the chill of the place\r\n",
      "as you walk from room to room. It was still early in the day and in\r\n",
      "the season, and I flattered myself that I was the only visitor. This\r\n",
      "complacency, however, dropped at sight of a person standing motionless\r\n",
      "before a simpering countess of Sir Peter Lely's creation. On hearing\r\n",
      "my footstep this victim of an evaporated spell turned his head and I\r\n",
      "recognised my fellow lodger of the Red Lion. I was apparently recognised\r\n",
      "as well; he looked as if he could scarce wait for me to be kind to him,\r\n",
      "and in fact didn't wait. Seeing I had a catalogue he asked the name of\r\n",
      "the portrait. On my satisfying him he appealed, rather timidly, as to my\r\n",
      "opinion of the lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said I, not quite timidly enough perhaps, \"I confess she strikes\r\n",
      "me as no great matter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He remained silent and was evidently a little abashed. As we strolled\r\n",
      "away he stole a sidelong glance of farewell at his leering shepherdess.\r\n",
      "To speak with him face to face was to feel keenly that he was no less\r\n",
      "interesting than infirm. We talked of our inn, of London, of the palace;\r\n",
      "he uttered his mind freely, but seemed to struggle with a weight of\r\n",
      "depression. It was an honest mind enough, with no great cultivation but\r\n",
      "with a certain natural love of excellent things. I foresaw that I\r\n",
      "should find him quite to the manner born--to ours; full of glimpses and\r\n",
      "responses, of deserts and desolations. His perceptions would be fine and\r\n",
      "his opinions pathetic; I should moreover take refuge from his sense of\r\n",
      "proportion in his sense of humour, and then refuge from THAT, ah me!--in\r\n",
      "what? On my telling him that I was a fellow citizen he stopped short,\r\n",
      "deeply touched, and, silently passing his arm into my own, suffered me\r\n",
      "to lead him through the other apartments and down into the gardens. A\r\n",
      "large gravelled platform stretches itself before the basement of the\r\n",
      "palace, taking the afternoon sun. Parts of the great structure are\r\n",
      "reserved for private use and habitation, occupied by state-pensioners,\r\n",
      "reduced gentlewomen in receipt of the Queen's bounty and other deserving\r\n",
      "persons. Many of the apartments have their dependent gardens, and here\r\n",
      "and there, between the verdure-coated walls, you catch a glimpse of\r\n",
      "these somewhat stuffy bowers. My companion and I measured more than once\r\n",
      "this long expanse, looking down on the floral figures of the rest of the\r\n",
      "affair and on the stoutly-woven tapestry of creeping plants that muffle\r\n",
      "the foundations of the huge red pile. I thought of the various images of\r\n",
      "old-world gentility which, early and late, must have strolled in front\r\n",
      "of it and felt the protection and security of the place. We peeped\r\n",
      "through an antique grating into one of the mossy cages and saw an old\r\n",
      "lady with a black mantilla on her head, a decanter of water in one hand\r\n",
      "and a crutch in the other, come forth, followed by three little dogs and\r\n",
      "a cat, to sprinkle a plant. She would probably have had an opinion on\r\n",
      "the virtue of Queen Caroline. Feeling these things together made us\r\n",
      "quickly, made us extraordinarily, intimate. My companion seemed to ache\r\n",
      "with his impression; he scowled, all gently, as if it gave him pain. I\r\n",
      "proposed at last that we should dine somewhere on the spot and take\r\n",
      "a late train to town. We made our way out of the gardens into the\r\n",
      "adjoining village, where we entered an inn which I pronounced, very\r\n",
      "sincerely, exactly what we wanted. Mr. Searle had approached our board\r\n",
      "as shyly as if it had been a cold bath; but, gradually warming to his\r\n",
      "work, he declared at the end of half an hour that for the first time in\r\n",
      "a month he enjoyed his victuals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you're rather out of health,\" I risked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, sir--I'm an incurable.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little village of Hampton Court stands clustered about the entrance\r\n",
      "of Bushey Park, and after we had dined we lounged along into the\r\n",
      "celebrated avenue of horse-chestnuts. There is a rare emotion, familiar\r\n",
      "to every intelligent traveller, in which the mind seems to swallow the\r\n",
      "sum total of its impressions at a gulp. You take in the whole place,\r\n",
      "whatever it be. You feel England, you feel Italy, and the sensation\r\n",
      "involves for the moment a kind of thrill. I had known it from time to\r\n",
      "time in Italy and had opened my soul to it as to the spirit of the\r\n",
      "Lord. Since my landing in England I had been waiting for it to arrive. A\r\n",
      "bottle of tolerable Burgundy, at dinner, had perhaps unlocked to it the\r\n",
      "gates of sense; it arrived now with irresistible force. Just the scene\r\n",
      "around me was the England of one's early reveries. Over against us, amid\r\n",
      "the ripeness of its gardens, the dark red residence, with its formal\r\n",
      "facings and its vacant windows, seemed to make the past definite and\r\n",
      "massive; the little village, nestling between park and palace, around\r\n",
      "a patch of turfy common, with its taverns of figurative names, its\r\n",
      "ivy-towered church, its mossy roofs, looked like the property of a\r\n",
      "feudal lord. It was in this dark composite light that I had read the\r\n",
      "British classics; it was this mild moist air that had blown from the\r\n",
      "pages of the poets; while I seemed to feel the buried generations in the\r\n",
      "dense and elastic sod. And that I must have testified in some form or\r\n",
      "other to what I have called my thrill I gather, remembering it, from a\r\n",
      "remark of my companion's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've the advantage over me in coming to all this with an educated\r\n",
      "eye. You already know what old things can be. I've never known it but by\r\n",
      "report. I've always fancied I should like it. In a small way at home, of\r\n",
      "course, I did try to stand by my idea of it. I must be a conservative by\r\n",
      "nature. People at home used to call me a cockney and a fribble. But it\r\n",
      "wasn't true,\" he went on; \"if it had been I should have made my way over\r\n",
      "here long ago: before--before--\" He paused, and his head dropped sadly\r\n",
      "on his breast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bottle of Burgundy had loosened his tongue; I had but to choose my\r\n",
      "time for learning his story. Something told me that I had gained his\r\n",
      "confidence and that, so far as attention and attitude might go, I was\r\n",
      "\"in\" for responsibilities. But somehow I didn't dread them. \"Before you\r\n",
      "lost your health,\" I suggested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Before I lost my health,\" he answered. \"And my property--the little I\r\n",
      "had. And my ambition. And any power to take myself seriously.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come!\" I cried. \"You shall recover everything. This tonic English\r\n",
      "climate will wind you up in a month. And THEN see how you'll take\r\n",
      "yourself--and how I shall take you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he gratefully smiled, \"I may turn to dust in your hands! I should\r\n",
      "like,\" he presently pursued, \"to be an old genteel pensioner, lodged\r\n",
      "over there in the palace and spending my days in maundering about these\r\n",
      "vistas. I should go every morning, at the hour when it gets the sun,\r\n",
      "into that long gallery where all those pretty women of Lely's are\r\n",
      "hung--I know you despise them!--and stroll up and down and say something\r\n",
      "kind to them. Poor precious forsaken creatures! So flattered and courted\r\n",
      "in their day, so neglected now! Offering up their shoulders and ringlets\r\n",
      "and smiles to that musty deadly silence!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I laid my hand on my friend's shoulder. \"Oh sir, you're all right!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just at this moment there came cantering down the shallow glade of the\r\n",
      "avenue a young girl on a fine black horse--one of those little budding\r\n",
      "gentlewomen, perfectly mounted and equipped, who form to alien eyes one\r\n",
      "of the prettiest incidents of English scenery. She had distanced her\r\n",
      "servant and, as she came abreast of us, turned slightly in her saddle\r\n",
      "and glanced back at him. In the movement she dropped the hunting-crop\r\n",
      "with which she was armed; whereupon she reined up and looked shyly at\r\n",
      "us and at the implement. \"This is something better than a Lely,\" I\r\n",
      "said. Searle hastened forward, picked up the crop and, with a particular\r\n",
      "courtesy that became him, handed it back to the rider. Fluttered and\r\n",
      "blushing she reached forward, took it with a quick sweet sound, and the\r\n",
      "next moment was bounding over the quiet turf. Searle stood watching her;\r\n",
      "the servant, as he passed us, touched his hat. When my friend turned\r\n",
      "toward me again I saw that he too was blushing. \"Oh sir, you're all\r\n",
      "right,\" I repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a short distance from where we had stopped was an old stone bench. We\r\n",
      "went and sat down on it and, as the sun began to sink, watched the light\r\n",
      "mist powder itself with gold. \"We ought to be thinking of the train back\r\n",
      "to London, I suppose,\" I at last said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh hang the train!\" sighed my companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Willingly. There could be no better spot than this to feel the English\r\n",
      "evening stand still.\" So we lingered, and the twilight hung about us,\r\n",
      "strangely clear in spite of the thickness of the air. As we sat there\r\n",
      "came into view an apparition unmistakeable from afar as an immemorial\r\n",
      "vagrant--the disowned, in his own rich way, of all the English ages. As\r\n",
      "he approached us he slackened pace and finally halted, touching his cap.\r\n",
      "He was a man of middle age, clad in a greasy bonnet with false-looking\r\n",
      "ear-locks depending from its sides. Round his neck was a grimy red\r\n",
      "scarf, tucked into his waistcoat; his coat and trousers had a remote\r\n",
      "affinity with those of a reduced hostler. In one hand he had a stick; on\r\n",
      "his arm he bore a tattered basket, with a handful of withered\r\n",
      "vegetables at the bottom. His face was pale haggard and degraded beyond\r\n",
      "description--as base as a counterfeit coin, yet as modelled somehow as\r\n",
      "a tragic mask. He too, like everything else, had a history. From what\r\n",

      "in the immortality of the soul. The soul is immortal, certainly--if\r\n",
      "you've got one; but most people haven't. Pleasure would be right if it\r\n",
      "were pleasure straight through; but it never is. My taste was to be the\r\n",
      "best in the world; well, perhaps it was. I had a little money; it went\r\n",

      "without composition, as they say of pictures, without the lovely mystery\r\n",
      "of colour. To furnish colour I melted down the very substance of my own\r\n",

      "of. How it was I never got free is more than I can say. It might have\r\n",
      "cut the knot, but the knot was too tight. I was always out of health or\r\n",
      "in debt or somehow desperately dangling. Besides, I had a horror of the\r\n",
      "great black sickening sea. A year ago I was reminded of the existence of\r\n",
      "an old claim to an English estate, which has danced before the eyes of\r\n",
      "my family, at odd moments, any time these eighty years. I confess it's a\r\n",
      "bit of a muddle and a tangle, and am by no means sure that to this hour\r\n",
      "I've got the hang of it. You look as if you had a clear head: some other\r\n",
      "time, if you consent, we'll have a go at it, such as it is, together.\r\n",

      "'points' of our case to memory, as I used to get nine-times-nine by\r\n",

      "up some fine morning and hear through a latticed casement the cawing of\r\n",
      "an English rookery. A couple of months ago there came out to England on\r\n",
      "business of his own a man who once got me out of a dreadful mess (not\r\n",
      "that I had hurt anyone but myself), a legal practitioner in our courts,\r\n",
      "a very rough diamond, but with a great deal of FLAIR, as they say in New\r\n",
      "York. It was with him yesterday you saw me dining. He undertook, as\r\n",
      "he called it, to 'nose round' and see if anything could be made of our\r\n",
      "questionable but possible show. The matter had never seriously been\r\n",
      "taken up. A month later I got a letter from Simmons assuring me that it\r\n",
      "seemed a very good show indeed and that he should be greatly surprised\r\n",
      "if I were unable to do something. This was the greatest push I had ever\r\n",
      "got in my life; I took a deliberate step, for the first time; I sailed\r\n",
      "for England. I've been here three days: they've seemed three months.\r\n",
      "After keeping me waiting for thirty-six hours my legal adviser makes his\r\n",
      "appearance last night and states to me, with his mouth full of mutton,\r\n",
      "that I haven't a leg to stand on, that my claim is moonshine, and that\r\n",
      "I must do penance and take a ticket for six more days of purgatory\r\n",
      "with his presence thrown in. My friend, my friend--shall I say I was\r\n",
      "disappointed? I'm already resigned. I didn't really believe I had\r\n",
      "any case. I felt in my deeper consciousness that it was the crowning\r\n",
      "illusion of a life of illusions. Well, it was a pretty one. Poor legal\r\n",
      "adviser!--I forgive him with all my heart. But for him I shouldn't be\r\n",
      "sitting in this place, in this air, under these impressions. This is a\r\n",
      "world I could have got on with beautifully. There's an immense charm in\r\n",
      "its having been kept for the last. After it nothing else would have been\r\n",
      "tolerable. I shall now have a month of it, I hope, which won't be long\r\n",
      "enough for it to \"go back on me. There's one thing!\"--and here, pausing,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "we were looking at it for the first or the last time, made it arrest us\r\n",
      "at every step. The countryside, in the full warm rains of the last\r\n",
      "of April, had burst into sudden perfect spring. The dark walls of the\r\n",
      "hedgerows had turned into blooming screens, the sodden verdure of lawn\r\n",
      "and meadow been washed over with a lighter brush. We went forth without\r\n",
      "loss of time for a long walk on the great grassy hills, smooth arrested\r\n",
      "central billows of some primitive upheaval, from the summits of which\r\n",
      "you find half England unrolled at your feet. A dozen broad counties,\r\n",

      "in it only a refinement of art. The sky never was empty and never idle;\r\n",
      "the clouds were continually at play for our benefit. Over against\r\n",
      "us, from our station on the hills, we saw them piled and dissolved,\r\n",
      "condensed and shifted, blotting the blue with sullen rain-spots,\r\n",
      "stretching, breeze-fretted, into dappled fields of grey, bursting into\r\n",
      "an explosion of light or melting into a drizzle of silver. We made our\r\n",
      "way along the rounded ridge of the downs and reached, by a descent,\r\n",
      "through slanting angular fields, green to cottage-doors, a russet\r\n",
      "village that beckoned us from the heart of the maze in which the hedges\r\n",
      "wrapped it up. Close beside it, I admit, the roaring train bounces out\r\n",
      "of a hole in the hills; yet there broods upon this charming hamlet an\r\n",
      "old-time quietude that makes a violation of confidence of naming it so\r\n",
      "far away. We struck through a narrow lane, a green lane, dim with its\r\n",
      "barriers of hawthorn; it led us to a superb old farmhouse, now rather\r\n",
      "rudely jostled by the multiplied roads and by-ways that have reduced its\r\n",
      "ancient appanage. It stands there in stubborn picturesqueness, doggedly\r\n",
      "submitting to be pointed out and sketched. It is a wonderful image of\r\n",
      "the domiciliary conditions of the past--cruelly complete; with bended\r\n",
      "beams and joists, beneath the burden of gables, that seem to ache and\r\n",
      "groan with memories and regrets. The short low windows, where lead and\r\n",
      "glass combine equally to create an inward gloom, retain their opacity as\r\n",
      "a part of the primitive idea of defence. Such an old house provokes on\r\n",
      "the part of an American a luxury of respect. So propped and patched, so\r\n",
      "tinkered with clumsy tenderness, clustered so richly about its central\r\n",
      "English sturdiness, its oaken vertebrations, so humanised with ages\r\n",

      "grateful eyes a small rude symbol of the great English social order.\r\n",
      "Passing out upon the highroad, we came to the common browsing-patch,\r\n",
      "the \"village-green\" of the tales of our youth. Nothing was absent: the\r\n",
      "shaggy mouse-coloured donkey, nosing the turf with his mild and huge\r\n",
      "proboscis, the geese, the old woman--THE old woman, in person, with\r\n",
      "her red cloak and her black bonnet, frilled about the face and\r\n",
      "double-frilled beside her decent placid cheeks--the towering ploughman\r\n",
      "with his white smock-frock puckered on chest and back, his short\r\n",
      "corduroys, his mighty calves, his big red rural face. We greeted these\r\n",
      "things as children greet the loved pictures in a storybook lost and\r\n",
      "mourned and found again. We recognised them as one recognises the\r\n",
      "handwriting on letter-backs. Beside the road we saw a ploughboy straddle\r\n",
      "whistling on a stile, and he had the merit of being not only a ploughboy\r\n",
      "but a Gainsborough. Beyond the stile, across the level velvet of a\r\n",
      "meadow, a footpath wandered like a streak drawn by a finger over a\r\n",
      "surface of fine plush. We followed it from field to field and from\r\n",
      "stile to stile; it was all adorably the way to church. At the church we\r\n",
      "finally arrived, lost in its rook-haunted churchyard, hidden from the\r\n",
      "workday world by the broad stillness of pastures--a grey, grey tower, a\r\n",
      "huge black yew, a cluster of village-graves with crooked headstones and\r\n",
      "protrusions that had settled and sunk. The place seemed so to ache with\r\n",
      "consecration that my sensitive companion gave way to the force of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must bury me here, you know\"--he caught at my arm. \"It's the first\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It took the Church, we agreed, to make churches, but we had the sense\r\n",
      "the next day of seeing still better why. We walked over some seven\r\n",
      "miles, to the nearer of the two neighbouring seats of that lesson; and\r\n",
      "all through such a mist of local colour that we felt ourselves a pair\r\n",
      "of Smollett's pedestrian heroes faring tavernward for a night of\r\n",
      "adventures. As we neared the provincial city we saw the steepled mass of\r\n",
      "the cathedral, long and high, rise far into the cloud-freckled blue; and\r\n",
      "as we got closer stopped on a bridge and looked down at the reflexion of\r\n",
      "the solid minster in a yellow stream. Going further yet we entered\r\n",
      "the russet town--where surely Miss Austen's heroines, in chariots\r\n",
      "and curricles, must often have come a-shopping for their sandals and\r\n",
      "mittens; we lounged in the grassed and gravelled precinct and gazed\r\n",
      "insatiably at that most soul-soothing sight, the waning wasting\r\n",
      "afternoon light, the visible ether that feels the voices of the chimes\r\n",
      "cling far aloft to the quiet sides of the cathedral-tower; saw it linger\r\n",
      "and nestle and abide, as it loves to do on all perpendicular spaces,\r\n",
      "converting them irresistibly into registers and dials; tasted too, as\r\n",
      "deeply, of the peculiar stillness of this place of priests; saw a rosy\r\n",
      "English lad come forth and lock the door of the old foundation-school\r\n",
      "that dovetailed with cloister and choir, and carry his big responsible\r\n",
      "key into one of the quiet canonical houses: and then stood musing\r\n",
      "together on the effect on one's mind of having in one's boyhood gone and\r\n",
      "come through cathedral-shades as a King's scholar, and yet kept ruddy\r\n",
      "with much cricket in misty river meadows. On the third morning we betook\r\n",
      "ourselves to Lackley, having learned that parts of the \"grounds\" were\r\n",
      "open to visitors, and that indeed on application the house was sometimes\r\n",
      "shown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Within the range of these numerous acres the declining spurs of the\r\n",
      "hills continued to undulate and subside. A long avenue wound and circled\r\n",
      "from the outermost gate through an untrimmed woodland, whence you\r\n",
      "glanced at further slopes and glades and copses and bosky recesses--at\r\n",
      "everything except the limits of the place. It was as free and untended\r\n",
      "as I had found a few of the large loose villas of old Italy, and I was\r\n",
      "still never to see the angular fact of English landlordism muffle itself\r\n",
      "in so many concessions. The weather had just become perfect; it was one\r\n",
      "of the dozen exquisite days of the English year--days stamped with a\r\n",
      "purity unknown in climates where fine weather is cheap. It was as if the\r\n",
      "mellow brightness, as tender as that of the primroses which starred the\r\n",
      "dark waysides like petals wind-scattered over beds of moss, had been\r\n",
      "meted out to us by the cubic foot--distilled from an alchemist's\r\n",
      "crucible. From this pastoral abundance we moved upon the more composed\r\n",
      "scene, the park proper--passed through a second lodge-gate, with\r\n",
      "weather-worn gilding on its twisted bars, to the smooth slopes where the\r\n",
      "great trees stood singly and the tame deer browsed along the bed of\r\n",
      "a woodland stream. Here before us rose the gabled grey front of the\r\n",

      "prince who has come back on tiptoe and hovers about the dominion of the\r\n",
      "usurper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To think of 'others' having hugged this all these years!\" he answered.\r\n",
      "\"I know what I am, but what might I have been? What do such places make\r\n",
      "of a man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I dare say he gets stupidly used to them,\" I said. \"But I dare say too,\r\n",
      "even then, that when you scratch the mere owner you find the perfect\r\n",
      "lover.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What a perfect scene and background it forms!\" my friend, however,\r\n",
      "had meanwhile gone on. \"What legends, what histories it knows! My heart\r\n",
      "really breaks with all I seem to guess. There's Tennyson's Talking Oak!\r\n",
      "What summer days one could spend here! How I could lounge the rest of my\r\n",
      "life away on this turf of the middle ages! Haven't I some maiden-cousin\r\n",
      "in that old hall, or grange, or court--what in the name of enchantment\r\n",
      "do you call the thing?--who would give me kind leave?\" And then he\r\n",
      "turned almost fiercely upon me. \"Why did you bring me here? Why did you\r\n",
      "drag me into this distraction of vain regrets?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment there passed within call a decent lad who had emerged\r\n",
      "from the gardens and who might have been an underling in the stables. I\r\n",
      "hailed him and put the question of our possible admittance to the house.\r\n",
      "He answered that the master was away from home, but that he thought it\r\n",
      "probable the housekeeper would consent to do the honours. I passed my\r\n",
      "arm into Searle's. \"Come,\" I said; \"drain the cup, bitter-sweet though\r\n",
      "it be. We must go in.\" We hastened slowly and approached the fine front.\r\n",
      "The house was one of the happiest fruits of its freshly-feeling era,\r\n",
      "a multitudinous cluster of fair gables and intricate chimneys, brave\r\n",
      "projections and quiet recesses, brown old surfaces weathered to silver\r\n",
      "and mottled roofs that testified not to seasons but to centuries. Two\r\n",
      "broad terraces commanded the wooded horizon. Our appeal was answered by\r\n",
      "a butler who condescended to our weakness. He renewed the assertion that\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle was away from home, but he would himself lay our case before\r\n",
      "the housekeeper. We would be so good, however, as to give him our cards.\r\n",
      "This request, following so directly on the assertion that Mr. Searle\r\n",
      "was absent, was rather resented by my companion. \"Surely not for the\r\n",
      "housekeeper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The butler gave a diplomatic cough. \"Miss Searle is at home, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yours alone will have to serve,\" said my friend. I took out a card and\r\n",
      "pencil and wrote beneath my name NEW YORK. As I stood with the pencil\r\n",
      "poised a temptation entered into it. Without in the least considering\r\n",
      "proprieties or results I let my implement yield--I added above my name\r\n",
      "that of Mr. Clement Searle. What would come of it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before many minutes the housekeeper waited upon us--a fresh rosy little\r\n",
      "old woman in a clean dowdy cap and a scanty sprigged gown; a quaint\r\n",
      "careful person, but accessible to the tribute of our pleasure, to say\r\n",
      "nothing of any other. She had the accent of the country, but the manners\r\n",
      "of the house. Under her guidance we passed through a dozen apartments,\r\n",
      "duly stocked with old pictures, old tapestry, old carvings, old armour,\r\n",
      "with a hundred ornaments and treasures. The pictures were especially\r\n",
      "valuable. The two Vandykes, the trio of rosy Rubenses, the sole and\r\n",
      "sombre Rembrandt, glowed with conscious authenticity. A Claude, a\r\n",
      "Murillo, a Greuze, a couple of Gainsboroughs, hung there with high\r\n",
      "complacency. Searle strolled about, scarcely speaking, pale and grave,\r\n",
      "with bloodshot eyes and lips compressed. He uttered no comment on what\r\n",
      "we saw--he asked but a question or two. Missing him at last from my side\r\n",
      "I retraced my steps and found him in a room we had just left, on a faded\r\n",
      "old ottoman and with his elbows on his knees and his face buried in\r\n",
      "his hands. Before him, ranged on a great credence, was a magnificent\r\n",
      "collection of old Italian majolica; plates of every shape, with their\r\n",
      "glaze of happy colour, jugs and vases nobly bellied and embossed. There\r\n",
      "seemed to rise before me, as I looked, a sudden vision of the young\r\n",
      "English gentleman who, eighty years ago, had travelled by slow stages to\r\n",
      "Italy and been waited on at his inn by persuasive toymen. \"What is it,\r\n",
      "my dear man?\" I asked. \"Are you unwell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He uncovered his haggard face and showed me the flush of a consciousness\r\n",
      "sharper, I think, to myself than to him. \"A memory of the past!\r\n",
      "There comes back to me a china vase that used to stand on the parlour\r\n",
      "mantel-shelf when I was a boy, with a portrait of General Jackson\r\n",
      "painted on one side and a bunch of flowers on the other. How long do you\r\n",
      "suppose that majolica has been in the family?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A long time probably. It was brought hither in the last century, into\r\n",
      "old, old England, out of old, old Italy, by some contemporary dandy with\r\n",
      "a taste for foreign gimcracks. Here it has stood for a hundred years,\r\n",
      "keeping its clear firm hues in this quiet light that has never sought to\r\n",
      "advertise it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle sprang to his feet. \"I say, for mercy's sake, take me away! I\r\n",
      "can't stand this sort of thing. Before I know it I shall do something\r\n",
      "scandalous. I shall steal some of their infernal crockery. I shall\r\n",
      "proclaim my identity and assert my rights. I shall go blubbering to Miss\r\n",
      "Searle and ask her in pity's name to 'put me up.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If he could ever have been said to threaten complications he rather\r\n",
      "visibly did so now. I began to regret my officious presentation of\r\n",
      "his name and prepared without delay to lead him out of the house. We\r\n",
      "overtook the housekeeper in the last room of the series, a small unused\r\n",
      "boudoir over whose chimney-piece hung a portrait of a young man in a\r\n",
      "powdered wig and a brocaded waistcoat. I was struck with his resemblance\r\n",
      "to my companion while our guide introduced him. \"This is Mr. Clement\r\n",
      "Searle, Mr. Searle's great-uncle, by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He died young,\r\n",
      "poor gentleman; he perished at sea, going to America.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He was the young buck who brought the majolica out of Italy,\" I\r\n",
      "supplemented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed, sir, I believe he did,\" said the housekeeper without wonder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's the image of you, my dear Searle,\" I further observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's remarkably like the gentleman, saving his presence,\" said the\r\n",
      "housekeeper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My friend stood staring. \"Clement Searle--at sea--going to America--?\"\r\n",
      "he broke out. Then with some sharpness to our old woman: \"Why the devil\r\n",
      "did he go to America?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why indeed, sir? You may well ask. I believe he had kinsfolk there. It\r\n",
      "was for them to come to him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle broke into a laugh. \"It was for them to come to him! Well, well,\"\r\n",
      "he said, fixing his eyes on our guide, \"they've come to him at last!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She blushed like a wrinkled rose-leaf. \"Indeed, sir, I verily believe\r\n",
      "you're one of US!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My name's the name of that beautiful youth,\" Searle went on. \"Dear\r\n",
      "kinsman I'm happy to meet you! And what do you think of this?\" he\r\n",
      "pursued as he grasped me by the arm. \"I have an idea. He perished at\r\n",
      "sea. His spirit came ashore and wandered about in misery till it got\r\n",
      "another incarnation--in this poor trunk!\" And he tapped his hollow\r\n",
      "chest. \"Here it has rattled about these forty years, beating its wings\r\n",
      "against its rickety cage, begging to be taken home again. And I never\r\n",
      "knew what was the matter with me! Now at last the bruised spirit can\r\n",
      "escape!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our old lady gaped at a breadth of appreciation--if not at the\r\n",
      "disclosure of a connexion--beyond her. The scene was really\r\n",
      "embarrassing, and my confusion increased as we became aware of another\r\n",
      "presence. A lady had appeared in the doorway and the housekeeper dropped\r\n",
      "just audibly: \"Miss Searle!\" My first impression of Miss Searle was that\r\n",
      "she was neither young nor beautiful. She stood without confidence on the\r\n",
      "threshold, pale, trying to smile and twirling my card in her fingers.\r\n",
      "I immediately bowed. Searle stared at her as if one of the pictures had\r\n",
      "stepped out of its frame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I'm not mistaken one of you gentlemen is Mr. Clement Searle,\" the\r\n",
      "lady adventured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My friend's Mr. Clement Searle,\" I took upon myself to reply. \"Allow me\r\n",
      "to add that I alone am responsible for your having received his name.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should have been sorry not to--not to see him,\" said Miss Searle,\r\n",
      "beginning to blush. \"Your being from America has led me--perhaps to\r\n",
      "intrude!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The intrusion, madam, has been on our part. And with just that\r\n",
      "excuse--that we come from so far away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Searle, while I spoke, had fixed her eyes on my friend as he stood\r\n",
      "silent beneath Sir Joshua's portrait. The housekeeper, agitated and\r\n",
      "mystified, fairly let herself go. \"Heaven preserve us, Miss! It's your\r\n",
      "great-uncle's picture come to life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not mistaken then,\" said Miss Searle--\"we must be distantly\r\n",
      "related.\" She had the air of the shyest of women, for whom it was almost\r\n",
      "anguish to make an advance without help. Searle eyed her with gentle\r\n",
      "wonder from head to foot, and I could easily read his thoughts. This\r\n",
      "then was his maiden-cousin, prospective mistress of these hereditary\r\n",
      "treasures. She was of some thirty-five years of age, taller than was\r\n",
      "then common and perhaps stouter than is now enjoined. She had small\r\n",
      "kind grey eyes, a considerable quantity of very light-brown hair and a\r\n",
      "smiling well-formed mouth. She was dressed in a lustreless black\r\n",
      "satin gown with a short train. Disposed about her neck was a blue\r\n",
      "handkerchief, and over this handkerchief, in many convolutions, a string\r\n",
      "of amber beads. Her appearance was singular; she was large yet somehow\r\n",
      "vague, mature yet undeveloped. Her manner of addressing us spoke of all\r\n",
      "sorts of deep diffidences. Searle, I think, had prefigured to himself\r\n",
      "some proud cold beauty of five-and-twenty; he was relieved at finding\r\n",
      "the lady timid and not obtrusively fair. He at once had an excellent\r\n",
      "tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We're distant cousins, I believe. I'm happy to claim a relationship\r\n",
      "which you're so good as to remember. I hadn't counted on your knowing\r\n",
      "anything about me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps I've done wrong.\" And Miss Searle blushed and smiled anew. \"But\r\n",
      "I've always known of there being people of our blood in America, and\r\n",
      "have often wondered and asked about them--without ever learning much.\r\n",
      "To-day, when this card was brought me and I understood a Clement Searle\r\n",
      "to be under our roof as a stranger, I felt I ought to do something. But,\r\n",
      "you know, I hardly knew what. My brother's in London. I've done what I\r\n",
      "think he would have done. Welcome as a cousin.\" And with a resolution\r\n",
      "that ceased to be awkward she put out her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm welcome indeed if he would have done it half so graciously!\" Again\r\n",
      "Searle, taking her hand, acquitted himself beautifully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've seen what there is, I think,\" Miss Searle went on. \"Perhaps now\r\n",
      "you'll have luncheon.\" We followed her into a small breakfast-room where\r\n",
      "a deep bay window opened on the mossy flags of a terrace. Here, for some\r\n",
      "moments, she remained dumb and abashed, as if resting from a measurable\r\n",
      "effort. Searle too had ceased to overflow, so that I had to relieve the\r\n",
      "silence. It was of course easy to descant on the beauties of park and\r\n",
      "mansion, and as I did so I observed our hostess. She had no arts, no\r\n",
      "impulses nor graces--scarce even any manners; she was queerly, almost\r\n",
      "frowsily dressed; yet she pleased me well. She had an antique sweetness,\r\n",
      "a homely fragrance of old traditions. To be so simple, among those\r\n",
      "complicated treasures, so pampered and yet so fresh, so modest and yet\r\n",
      "so placid, told of just the spacious leisure in which Searle and I had\r\n",
      "imagined human life to be steeped in such places as that. This figure\r\n",
      "was to the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood what a fact is to a fairy-tale,\r\n",
      "an interpretation to a myth. We, on our side, were to our hostess\r\n",
      "subjects of a curiosity not cunningly veiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should like so to go abroad!\" she exclaimed suddenly, as if she meant\r\n",
      "us to take the speech for an expression of interest in ourselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you never been?\" one of us asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only once. Three years ago my brother took me to Switzerland. We\r\n",
      "thought it extremely beautiful. Except for that journey I've always\r\n",
      "lived here. I was born in this house. It's a dear old place indeed, and\r\n",
      "I know it well. Sometimes one wants a change.\" And on my asking her\r\n",
      "how she spent her time and what society she saw, \"Of course it's very\r\n",
      "quiet,\" she went on, proceeding by short steps and simple statements, in\r\n",
      "the manner of a person called upon for the first time to analyse to that\r\n",
      "extent her situation. \"We see very few people. I don't think there are\r\n",
      "many nice ones hereabouts. At least we don't know them. Our own family's\r\n",
      "very small. My brother cares for nothing but riding and books. He had\r\n",
      "a great sorrow ten years ago. He lost his wife and his only son, a dear\r\n",
      "little boy, who of course would have had everything. Do you know that\r\n",
      "that makes me the heir, as they've done something--I don't quite\r\n",
      "know what--to the entail? Poor old me! Since his loss my brother has\r\n",
      "preferred to be quite alone. I'm sorry he's away. But you must wait till\r\n",
      "he comes back. I expect him in a day or two.\" She talked more and more,\r\n",
      "as if our very strangeness led her on, about her circumstances, her\r\n",
      "solitude, her bad eyes, so that she couldn't read, her flowers, her\r\n",
      "ferns, her dogs, and the vicar, recently presented to the living by\r\n",
      "her brother and warranted quite safe, who had lately begun to light his\r\n",
      "altar candles; pausing every now and then to gasp in self-surprise, yet,\r\n",
      "in the quaintest way in the world, keeping up her story as if it were\r\n",
      "a slow rather awkward old-time dance, a difficult pas seul in which\r\n",
      "she would have been better with more practice, but of which she must\r\n",
      "complete the figure. Of all the old things I had seen in England this\r\n",
      "exhibited mind of Miss Searle's seemed to me the oldest, the most handed\r\n",
      "down and taken for granted; fenced and protected as it was by convention\r\n",
      "and precedent and usage, thoroughly acquainted with its subordinate\r\n",
      "place. I felt as if I were talking with the heroine of a last-century\r\n",
      "novel. As she talked she rested her dull eyes on her kinsman with\r\n",
      "wondering kindness. At last she put it to him: \"Did you mean to go away\r\n",
      "without asking for us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I had thought it over, Miss Searle, and had determined not to trouble\r\n",
      "you. You've shown me how unfriendly I should have been.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you knew of the place being ours, and of our relationship?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just so. It was because of these things that I came down here--because\r\n",
      "of them almost that I came to England. I've always liked to think of\r\n",
      "them,\" said my companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You merely wished to look then? We don't pretend to be much to look\r\n",
      "at.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waited; her words were too strange. \"You don't know what you are,\r\n",
      "Miss Searle.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You like the old place then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle looked at her again in silence. \"If I could only tell you!\" he\r\n",
      "said at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do tell me. You must come and stay with us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It moved him to an oddity of mirth. \"Take care, take care--I should\r\n",
      "surprise you! I'm afraid I should bore you. I should never leave you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you'd get homesick--for your real home!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this he was still more amused. \"By the way, tell Miss Searle about\r\n",
      "our real home,\" he said to me. And he stepped, through the window, out\r\n",
      "upon the terrace, followed by two beautiful dogs, a setter and a young\r\n",
      "stag-hound who from the moment we came in had established the fondest\r\n",
      "relation with him. Miss Searle looked at him, while he went, as if she\r\n",
      "vaguely yearned over him; it began to be plain that she was interested\r\n",
      "in her exotic cousin. I suddenly recalled the last words I had heard\r\n",
      "spoken by my friend's adviser in London and which, in a very crude form,\r\n",
      "had reference to his making a match with this lady. If only Miss Searle\r\n",
      "could be induced to think of that, and if one had but the tact to put it\r\n",
      "in a light to her! Something assured me that her heart was virgin-soil,\r\n",
      "that the flower of romantic affection had never bloomed there. If I\r\n",
      "might just sow the seed! There seemed to shape itself within her the\r\n",
      "perfect image of one of the patient wives of old.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has lost his heart to England,\" I said. \"He ought to have been born\r\n",
      "here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet he doesn't look in the least an Englishman,\" she still rather\r\n",
      "guardedly prosed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it isn't his looks, poor fellow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course looks aren't everything. I never talked with a foreigner\r\n",
      "before; but he talks as I have fancied foreigners.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, he's foreign enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is he married?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His wife's dead and he's all alone in the world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has he much property?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"None to speak of.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But he has means to travel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I meditated. \"He has not expected to travel far,\" I said at last. \"You\r\n",
      "know, he's in very poor health.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Poor gentleman! So I supposed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But there's more of him to go on with than he thinks. He came here\r\n",
      "because he wanted to see your place before he dies.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear me--kind man!\" And I imagined in the quiet eyes the hint of a\r\n",
      "possible tear. \"And he was going away without my seeing him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's very modest, you see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's very much the gentleman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I couldn't but smile. \"He's ALL--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment we heard on the terrace a loud harsh cry. \"It's the great\r\n",
      "peacock!\" said Miss Searle, stepping to the window and passing out while\r\n",
      "I followed her. Below us, leaning on the parapet, stood our appreciative\r\n",
      "friend with his arm round the neck of the setter. Before him on\r\n",
      "the grand walk strutted the familiar fowl of gardens--a splendid\r\n",
      "specimen--with ruffled neck and expanded tail. The other dog had\r\n",
      "apparently indulged in a momentary attempt to abash the gorgeous biped,\r\n",
      "but at Searle's summons had bounded back to the terrace and leaped upon\r\n",
      "the ledge, where he now stood licking his new friend's face. The scene\r\n",
      "had a beautiful old-time air: the peacock flaunting in the foreground\r\n",
      "like the genius of stately places; the broad terrace, which flattered\r\n",
      "an innate taste of mine for all deserted walks where people may have sat\r\n",
      "after heavy dinners to drink coffee in old Sevres and where the stiff\r\n",
      "brocade of women's dresses may have rustled over grass or gravel; and\r\n",
      "far around us, with one leafy circle melting into another, the timbered\r\n",
      "acres of the park. \"The very beasts have made him welcome,\" I noted as\r\n",
      "we rejoined our companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The peacock has done for you, Mr. Searle,\" said his cousin, \"what he\r\n",
      "does only for very great people. A year ago there came here a great\r\n",
      "person--a grand old lady--to see my brother. I don't think that since\r\n",
      "then he has spread his tail as wide for any one else--not by a dozen\r\n",
      "feathers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's not alone the peacock,\" said Searle. \"Just now there came slipping\r\n",
      "across my path a little green lizard, the first I ever saw, the lizard\r\n",
      "of literature! And if you've a ghost, broad daylight though it be,\r\n",
      "I expect to see him here. Do you know the annals of your house, Miss\r\n",
      "Searle?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear, no! You must ask my brother for all those things.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You ought to have a collection of legends and traditions. You ought to\r\n",
      "have loves and murders and mysteries by the roomful. I shall be ashamed\r\n",
      "of you if you haven't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Mr. Searle! We've always been a very well-behaved family,\" she quite\r\n",
      "seriously pleaded. \"Nothing out of the way has ever happened, I think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing out of the way? Oh that won't do! We've managed better than\r\n",
      "that in America. Why I myself!\"--and he looked at her ruefully enough,\r\n",
      "but enjoying too his idea that he might embody the social scandal or\r\n",
      "point to the darkest drama of the Searles. \"Suppose I should turn out\r\n",
      "a better Searle than you--better than you nursed here in romance and\r\n",
      "extravagance? Come, don't disappoint me. You've some history among you\r\n",
      "all, you've some poetry, you've some accumulation of legend. I've been\r\n",
      "famished all my days for these things. Don't you understand? Ah you\r\n",
      "can't understand! Tell me,\" he rambled on, \"something tremendous. When\r\n",
      "I think of what must have happened here; of the lovers who must have\r\n",
      "strolled on this terrace and wandered under the beeches, of all the\r\n",
      "figures and passions and purposes that must have haunted these walls!\r\n",
      "When I think of the births and deaths, the joys and sufferings, the\r\n",
      "young hopes and the old regrets, the rich experience of life--!\" He\r\n",
      "faltered a moment with the increase of his agitation. His humour of\r\n",
      "dismay at a threat of the commonplace in the history he felt about him\r\n",
      "had turned to a deeper reaction. I began to fear however that he was\r\n",
      "really losing his head. He went on with a wilder play. \"To see it all\r\n",
      "called up there before me, if the Devil alone could do it I'd make a\r\n",
      "bargain with the Devil! Ah Miss Searle,\" he cried, \"I'm a most unhappy\r\n",
      "man!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear, oh dear!\" she almost wailed while I turned half away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look at that window, that dear little window!\" I turned back to see him\r\n",
      "point to a small protruding oriel, above us, relieved against the purple\r\n",
      "brickwork, framed in chiselled stone and curtained with ivy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's my little room,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course it's a woman's room. Think of all the dear faces--all of them\r\n",
      "so mild and yet so proud--that have looked out of that lattice, and of\r\n",
      "all the old-time women's lives whose principal view of the world has\r\n",
      "been this quiet park! Every one of them was a cousin of mine. And you,\r\n",
      "dear lady, you're one of them yet.\" With which he marched toward her and\r\n",
      "took her large white hand. She surrendered it, blushing to her eyes\r\n",
      "and pressing her other hand to her breast. \"You're a woman of the past.\r\n",
      "You're nobly simple. It has been a romance to see you. It doesn't matter\r\n",
      "what I say to you. You didn't know me yesterday, you'll not know me\r\n",
      "to-morrow. Let me to-day do a mad sweet thing. Let me imagine in you the\r\n",
      "spirit of all the dead women who have trod the terrace-flags that lie\r\n",
      "here like sepulchral tablets in the pavement of a church. Let me say I\r\n",
      "delight in you!\"--he raised her hand to his lips. She gently withdrew it\r\n",
      "and for a moment averted her face. Meeting her eyes the next instant I\r\n",
      "saw the tears had come. The Sleeping Beauty was awake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There followed an embarrassed pause. An issue was suddenly presented by\r\n",
      "the appearance of the butler bearing a letter. \"A telegram, Miss,\" he\r\n",
      "announced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh what shall I do?\" cried Miss Searle. \"I can't open a telegram.\r\n",
      "Cousin, help me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle took the missive, opened it and read aloud: \"I shall be home to\r\n",
      "dinner. Keep the American.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"KEEP the American!\" Miss Searle, in compliance with the injunction\r\n",
      "conveyed in her brother's telegram (with something certainly of\r\n",
      "telegraphic curtness), lost no time in expressing the pleasure it would\r\n",
      "give her that our friend should remain. \"Really you must,\" she said;\r\n",
      "and forthwith repaired to the house-keeper to give orders for the\r\n",
      "preparation of a room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how in the world did he know of my being here?\" my companion put to\r\n",
      "me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I answered that he had probably heard from his solicitor of the other's\r\n",
      "visit. \"Mr. Simmons and that gentleman must have had another interview\r\n",
      "since your arrival in England. Simmons, for reasons of his own, has\r\n",
      "made known to him your journey to this neighbourhood, and Mr. Searle,\r\n",
      "learning this, has immediately taken for granted that you've formally\r\n",
      "presented yourself to his sister. He's hospitably inclined and wishes\r\n",
      "her to do the proper thing by you. There may even,\" I went on, \"be more\r\n",
      "in it than that. I've my little theory that he's the very phoenix of\r\n",
      "usurpers, that he has been very much struck with what the experts have\r\n",
      "had to say for you, and that he wishes to have the originality of making\r\n",
      "over to you your share--so limited after all--of the estate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I give it up!\" my friend mused. \"Come what come will!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You, of course,\" said Miss Searle, reappearing and turning to me, \"are\r\n",
      "included in my brother's invitation. I've told them to see about a room\r\n",
      "for you. Your luggage shall immediately be sent for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was arranged that I in person should be driven over to our little inn\r\n",
      "and that I should return with our effects in time to meet Mr. Searle at\r\n",
      "dinner. On my arrival several hours later I was immediately conducted\r\n",
      "to my room. The servant pointed out to me that it communicated by a\r\n",
      "door and a private passage with that of my fellow visitor. I made my way\r\n",
      "along this passage--a low narrow corridor with a broad latticed casement\r\n",
      "through which there streamed upon a series of grotesquely sculptured\r\n",
      "oaken closets and cupboards the vivid animating glow of the western\r\n",
      "sun--knocked at his door and, getting no answer, opened it. In an\r\n",
      "armchair by the open window sat my friend asleep, his arms and legs\r\n",
      "relaxed and head dropped on his breast. It was a great relief to see him\r\n",
      "rest thus from his rhapsodies, and I watched him for some moments before\r\n",
      "waking him. There was a faint glow of colour in his cheek and a light\r\n",
      "expressive parting of his lips, something nearer to ease and peace than\r\n",
      "I had yet seen in him. It was almost happiness, it was almost health. I\r\n",
      "laid my hand on his arm and gently shook it. He opened his eyes, gazed\r\n",
      "at me a moment, vaguely recognised me, then closed them again. \"Let me\r\n",
      "dream, let me dream!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What are you dreaming about?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A moment passed before his answer came. \"About a tall woman in a quaint\r\n",
      "black dress, with yellow hair and a sweet, sweet smile, and a soft low\r\n",
      "delicious voice! I'm in love with her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's better to see her than to dream about her,\" I said. \"Get up and\r\n",
      "dress; then we'll go down to dinner and meet her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dinner--dinner--?\" And he gradually opened his eyes again. \"Yes, upon\r\n",
      "my word I shall dine!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you're all right!\" I declared for the twentieth time as he rose to\r\n",
      "his feet. \"You'll live to bury Mr. Simmons.\" He told me he had spent the\r\n",
      "hours of my absence with Miss Searle--they had strolled together half\r\n",
      "over the place. \"You must be very intimate,\" I smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's intimate with ME. Goodness knows what rigmarole I've treated her\r\n",
      "to!\" They had parted an hour ago; since when, he believed, her brother\r\n",
      "had arrived.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The slow-fading twilight was still in the great drawing-room when we\r\n",
      "came down. The housekeeper had told us this apartment was rarely used,\r\n",
      "there being others, smaller and more convenient, for the same needs.\r\n",
      "It seemed now, however, to be occupied in my comrade's honour. At the\r\n",
      "furthest end, rising to the roof like a royal tomb in a cathedral, was\r\n",
      "a great chimney-piece of chiselled white marble, yellowed by time, in\r\n",
      "which a light fire was crackling. Before the fire stood a small short\r\n",
      "man, with his hands behind him; near him was Miss Searle, so transformed\r\n",
      "by her dress that at first I scarcely knew her. There was in our\r\n",
      "entrance and reception something remarkably chilling and solemn. We\r\n",
      "moved in silence up the long room; Mr. Searle advanced slowly, a dozen\r\n",
      "steps, to meet us; his sister stood motionless. I was conscious of her\r\n",
      "masking her visage with a large white tinselled fan, and that her eyes,\r\n",
      "grave and enlarged, watched us intently over the top of it. The master\r\n",
      "of Lackley grasped in silence the proffered hand of his kinsman and eyed\r\n",
      "him from head to foot, suppressing, I noted, a start of surprise at his\r\n",
      "resemblance to Sir Joshua's portrait. \"This is a happy day.\" And then\r\n",
      "turning to me with an odd little sharp stare: \"My cousin's friend is my\r\n",
      "friend.\" Miss Searle lowered her fan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first thing that struck me in Mr. Searle's appearance was his very\r\n",
      "limited stature, which was less by half a head than that of his sister.\r\n",
      "The second was the preternatural redness of his hair and beard. They\r\n",
      "intermingled over his ears and surrounded his head like a huge lurid\r\n",
      "nimbus. His face was pale and attenuated, the face of a scholar, a\r\n",
      "dilettante, a comparer of points and texts, a man who lives in a library\r\n",
      "bending over books and prints and medals. At a distance it might have\r\n",
      "passed for smooth and rather blankly composed; but on a nearer view\r\n",
      "it revealed a number of wrinkles, sharply etched and scratched, of a\r\n",
      "singularly aged and refined effect. It was the complexion of a man of\r\n",
      "sixty. His nose was arched and delicate, identical almost with the nose\r\n",
      "of my friend. His eyes, large and deep-set, had a kind of auburn glow,\r\n",
      "the suggestion of a keen metal red-hot--or, more plainly, were full\r\n",
      "of temper and spirit. Imagine this physiognomy--grave and solemn,\r\n",
      "grotesquely solemn, in spite of the bushy brightness which made a sort\r\n",
      "of frame for it--set in motion by a queer, quick, defiant, perfunctory,\r\n",
      "preoccupied smile, and you will have an imperfect notion of the\r\n",
      "remarkable presence of our host; something better worth seeing and\r\n",
      "knowing, I perceived as I quite breathlessly took him in, than anything\r\n",
      "we had yet encountered. How thoroughly I had entered into sympathy\r\n",
      "with my poor picked-up friend, and how effectually I had associated my\r\n",
      "sensibilities with his own, I had not suspected till, within the short\r\n",
      "five minutes before the signal for dinner, I became aware, without his\r\n",
      "giving me the least hint, of his placing himself on the defensive. To\r\n",
      "neither of us was Mr. Searle sympathetic. I might have guessed from her\r\n",
      "attitude that his sister entered into our thoughts. A marked change had\r\n",
      "been wrought in her since the morning; during the hour, indeed--as\r\n",
      "I read in the light of the wondering glance he cast at her--that had\r\n",
      "elapsed since her parting with her cousin. She had not yet recovered\r\n",
      "from some great agitation. Her face was pale and she had clearly\r\n",
      "been crying. These notes of trouble gave her a new and quite perverse\r\n",
      "dignity, which was further enhanced by something complimentary and\r\n",
      "commemorative in her dress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether it was taste or whether it was accident I know not; but the\r\n",
      "amiable creature, as she stood there half in the cool twilight, half in\r\n",
      "the arrested glow of the fire as it spent itself in the vastness of its\r\n",
      "marble cave, was a figure for a painter. She was habited in some faded\r\n",
      "splendour of sea-green crape and silk, a piece of millinery which,\r\n",
      "though it must have witnessed a number of dull dinners, preserved still\r\n",
      "a festive air. Over her white shoulders she wore an ancient web of the\r\n",
      "most precious and venerable lace and about her rounded throat a single\r\n",
      "series of large pearls. I went in with her to dinner, and Mr. Searle,\r\n",
      "following with my friend, took his arm, as the latter afterwards told\r\n",
      "me, and pretended jocosely to conduct him. As dinner proceeded the\r\n",
      "feeling grew within me that a drama had begun to be played in which the\r\n",
      "three persons before me were actors--each of a really arduous part. The\r\n",
      "character allotted to my friend, however, was certainly the least easy\r\n",
      "to represent with effect, though I overflowed with the desire that he\r\n",
      "should acquit himself to his honour. I seemed to see him urge his faded\r\n",
      "faculties to take their cue and perform. The poor fellow tried to do\r\n",
      "himself credit more seriously than ever in his old best days. With Miss\r\n",
      "Searle, credulous passive and pitying, he had finally flung aside all\r\n",
      "vanity and propriety and shown the bottom of his fantastic heart.\r\n",
      "But with our host there might be no talking of nonsense nor taking\r\n",
      "of liberties; there and then, if ever, sat a consummate conservative,\r\n",
      "breathing the fumes of hereditary privilege and security. For an hour,\r\n",
      "accordingly, I saw my poor protege attempt, all in pain, to meet a new\r\n",
      "decorum. He set himself the task of appearing very American, in order\r\n",
      "that his appreciation of everything Mr. Searle represented might seem\r\n",
      "purely disinterested. What his kinsman had expected him to be I know\r\n",
      "not; but I made Mr. Searle out as annoyed, in spite of his exaggerated\r\n",
      "urbanity, at finding him so harmless. Our host was not the man to\r\n",
      "show his hand, but I think his best card had been a certain implicit\r\n",
      "confidence that so provincial a parasite would hardly have good manners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He led the conversation to the country we had left; rather as if a leash\r\n",
      "had been attached to the collar of some lumpish and half-domesticated\r\n",
      "animal the tendency of whose movements had to be recognised. He spoke of\r\n",
      "it indeed as of some fabled planet, alien to the British orbit, lately\r\n",
      "proclaimed to have the admixture of atmospheric gases required\r\n",
      "to support animal life, but not, save under cover of a liberal\r\n",
      "afterthought, to be admitted into one's regular conception of things. I,\r\n",
      "for my part, felt nothing but regret that the spheric smoothness of\r\n",
      "his universe should be disfigured by the extrusion even of such\r\n",
      "inconsiderable particles as ourselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I knew in a general way of our having somehow ramified over there,\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Searle mentioned; \"but had scarcely followed it more than you pretend to\r\n",
      "pick up the fruit your long-armed pear tree may drop, on the other side\r\n",
      "of your wall, in your neighbour's garden. There was a man I knew at\r\n",
      "Cambridge, a very odd fellow, a decent fellow too; he and I were rather\r\n",
      "cronies; I think he afterwards went to the Middle States. They'll be,\r\n",
      "I suppose, about the Mississippi? At all events, there was that\r\n",
      "great-uncle of mine whom Sir Joshua painted. He went to America, but he\r\n",
      "never got there. He was lost at sea. You look enough like him to make\r\n",
      "one fancy he DID get there and that you've kept him alive by one of\r\n",
      "those beastly processes--I think you have 'em over there: what do you\r\n",
      "call it, 'putting up' things? If you're he you've not done a wise thing\r\n",
      "to show yourself here. He left a bad name behind him. There's a ghost\r\n",
      "who comes sobbing about the house every now and then, the ghost of one\r\n",
      "to whom he did a wrong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh mercy ON us!\" cried Miss Searle in simple horror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course YOU know nothing of such things,\" he rather dryly allowed.\r\n",
      "\"You're too sound a sleeper to hear the sobbing of ghosts.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I should like immensely to hear the sobbing of a ghost,\" said\r\n",
      "my friend, the light of his previous eagerness playing up into his eyes.\r\n",
      "\"Why does it sob? I feel as if that were what we've come above all to\r\n",
      "learn.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle eyed his audience a moment gaugingly; he held the balance as\r\n",
      "to measure his resources. He wished to do justice to his theme. With\r\n",
      "the long finger-nails of his left hand nervously playing against the\r\n",
      "tinkling crystal of his wineglass and his conscious eyes betraying that,\r\n",
      "small and strange as he sat there, he knew himself, to his pleasure and\r\n",
      "advantage, remarkably impressive, he dropped into our untutored minds\r\n",
      "the sombre legend of his house. \"Mr. Clement Searle, from all I gather,\r\n",
      "was a young man of great talents but a weak disposition. His mother was\r\n",
      "left a widow early in life, with two sons, of whom he was the elder and\r\n",
      "the more promising. She educated him with the greatest affection and\r\n",
      "care. Of course when he came to manhood she wished him to marry well.\r\n",
      "His means were quite sufficient to enable him to overlook the want of\r\n",
      "money in his wife; and Mrs. Searle selected a young lady who possessed,\r\n",
      "as she conceived, every good gift save a fortune--a fine proud handsome\r\n",
      "girl, the daughter of an old friend, an old lover I suspect, of her own.\r\n",
      "Clement, however, as it appeared, had either chosen otherwise or was\r\n",
      "as yet unprepared to choose. The young lady opened upon him in vain the\r\n",
      "battery of her attractions; in vain his mother urged her cause. Clement\r\n",
      "remained cold, insensible, inflexible. Mrs. Searle had a character which\r\n",
      "appears to have gone out of fashion in my family nowadays; she was a\r\n",
      "great manager, a maitresse-femme. A proud passionate imperious woman,\r\n",
      "she had had immense cares and ever so many law-suits; they had sharpened\r\n",
      "her temper and her will. She suspected that her son's affections had\r\n",
      "another object, and this object she began to hate. Irritated by his\r\n",
      "stubborn defiance of her wishes she persisted in her purpose. The more\r\n",
      "she watched him the more she was convinced he loved in secret. If he\r\n",
      "loved in secret of course he loved beneath him. He went about the place\r\n",
      "all sombre and sullen and brooding. At last, with the rashness of an\r\n",
      "angry woman, she threatened to bring the young lady of her choice--who,\r\n",
      "by the way, seems to have been no shrinking blossom--to stay in the\r\n",
      "house. A stormy scene was the result. He threatened that if she did\r\n",
      "so he would leave the country and sail for America. She probably\r\n",
      "disbelieved him; she knew him to be weak, but she overrated his\r\n",
      "weakness. At all events the rejected one arrived and Clement Searle\r\n",
      "departed. On a dark December day he took ship at Southampton. The two\r\n",
      "women, desperate with rage and sorrow, sat alone in this big house,\r\n",
      "mingling their tears and imprecations. A fortnight later, on Christmas\r\n",
      "Eve, in the midst of a great snowstorm long famous in the country,\r\n",
      "something happened that quickened their bitterness. A young woman,\r\n",
      "battered and chilled by the storm, gained entrance to the house and,\r\n",
      "making her way into the presence of the mistress and her guest, poured\r\n",
      "out her tale. She was a poor curate's daughter out of some little hole\r\n",
      "in Gloucestershire. Clement Searle had loved her--loved her all too\r\n",
      "well! She had been turned out in wrath from her father's house; his\r\n",
      "mother at least might pity her--if not for herself then for the child\r\n",
      "she was soon to bring forth. Hut the poor girl had been a second time\r\n",
      "too trustful. The women, in scorn, in horror, with blows possibly, drove\r\n",
      "her forth again into the storm. In the storm she wandered and in the\r\n",
      "deep snow she died. Her lover, as you know, perished in that hard winter\r\n",
      "weather at sea; the news came to his mother late, but soon enough. We're\r\n",
      "haunted by the curate's daughter!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle retailed this anecdote with infinite taste and point, the\r\n",
      "happiest art; when he ceased there was a pause of some moments. \"Ah well\r\n",
      "we may be!\" Miss Searle then mournfully murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle blazed up into enthusiasm. \"Of course, you know\"--with which he\r\n",
      "began to blush violently--\"I should be sorry to claim any identity\r\n",
      "with the poor devil my faithless namesake. But I should be immensely\r\n",
      "gratified if the young lady's spirit, deceived by my resemblance, were\r\n",
      "to mistake me for her cruel lover. She's welcome to the comfort of it.\r\n",
      "What one can do in the case I shall be glad to do. But can a ghost haunt\r\n",
      "a ghost? I AM a ghost!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle stared a moment and then had a subtle sneer. \"I could almost\r\n",
      "believe you are!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh brother--and cousin!\" cried Miss Searle with the gentlest yet most\r\n",
      "appealing dignity. \"How can you talk so horribly?\" The horrible talk,\r\n",
      "however, evidently possessed a potent magic for my friend; and his\r\n",
      "imagination, checked a while by the influence of his kinsman, began\r\n",
      "again to lead him a dance. From this moment he ceased to steer his frail\r\n",
      "bark, to care what he said or how he said it, so long as he expressed\r\n",
      "his passionate appreciation of the scene around him. As he kept up this\r\n",
      "strain I ceased even secretly to wish he wouldn't. I have wondered since\r\n",
      "that I shouldn't have been annoyed by the way he reverted constantly to\r\n",
      "himself. But a great frankness, for the time, makes its own law and\r\n",
      "a great passion its own channel. There was moreover an irresponsible\r\n",
      "indescribable effect of beauty in everything his lips uttered. Free\r\n",
      "alike from adulation and from envy, the essence of his discourse was a\r\n",
      "divine apprehension, a romantic vision free as the flight of Ariel, of\r\n",
      "the poetry of his companions' situation and their contrasted general\r\n",
      "irresponsiveness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How does the look of age come?\" he suddenly broke out at dessert. \"Does\r\n",
      "it come of itself, unobserved, unrecorded, unmeasured? Or do you woo it\r\n",
      "and set baits and traps for it, and watch it like the dawning brownness\r\n",
      "of a meerschaum pipe, and make it fast, when it appears, just where it\r\n",
      "peeps out, and light a votive taper beneath it and give thanks to it\r\n",
      "daily? Or do you forbid it and fight it and resist it, and yet feel it\r\n",
      "settling and deepening about you as irresistible as fate?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What the deuce is the man talking about?\" said the smile of our host.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I found a little grey hair this morning,\" Miss Searle incoherently\r\n",
      "prosed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then I hope you paid it every respect!\" cried her visitor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I looked at it for a long time in my hand-glass,\" she answered with\r\n",
      "more presence of mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss Searle can for many years to come afford to be amused at grey\r\n",
      "hairs,\" I interposed in the hope of some greater ease. It had its\r\n",
      "effect. \"Ten years from last Thursday I shall be forty-four,\" she almost\r\n",
      "comfortably smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that's just what I am,\" said Searle. \"If I had only come here ten\r\n",
      "years ago! I should have had more time to enjoy the feast, but I should\r\n",
      "have had less appetite. I needed first to get famished.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh why did you wait for that?\" his entertainer asked. \"To think of\r\n",
      "these ten years that we might have been enjoying you!\" At the vision of\r\n",
      "which waste and loss Mr. Searle had a fine shrill laugh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" my friend explained, \"I always had a notion--a stupid vulgar\r\n",
      "notion if there ever was one--that to come abroad properly one had to\r\n",
      "have a pot of money. My pot was too nearly empty. At last I came with my\r\n",
      "empty pot!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle had a wait for delicacy, but he proceeded. \"You're reduced,\r\n",
      "you're--a--straitened?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our companion's very breath blew away the veil. \"Reduced to nothing.\r\n",
      "Straitened to the clothes on my back!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't say so!\" said Mr. Searle with a large vague gasp.\r\n",
      "\"Well--well--well!\" he added in a voice which might have meant\r\n",
      "everything or nothing; and then, in his whimsical way, went on to finish\r\n",
      "a glass of wine. His searching eye, as he drank, met mine, and for a\r\n",
      "moment we each rather deeply sounded the other, to the effect no doubt\r\n",
      "of a slight embarrassment. \"And you,\" he said by way of carrying this\r\n",
      "off--\"how about YOUR wardrobe?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh his!\" cried my friend; \"his wardrobe's immense. He could dress up a\r\n",
      "regiment!\" He had drunk more champagne--I admit that the champagne\r\n",
      "was good--than was from any point of view to have been desired. He was\r\n",
      "rapidly drifting beyond any tacit dissuasion of mine. He was feverish\r\n",
      "and rash, and all attempt to direct would now simply irritate him. As\r\n",
      "we rose from the table he caught my troubled look. Passing his arm for\r\n",
      "a moment into mine, \"This is the great night!\" he strangely and softly\r\n",
      "said; \"the night and the crisis that will settle me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle had caused the whole lower portion of the house to be thrown\r\n",
      "open and a multitude of lights to be placed in convenient and effective\r\n",
      "positions. Such a marshalled wealth of ancient candlesticks and\r\n",
      "flambeaux I had never beheld. Niched against the dusky wainscots,\r\n",
      "casting great luminous circles upon the pendent stiffness of sombre\r\n",
      "tapestries, enhancing and completing with admirable effect the variety\r\n",
      "and mystery of the great ancient house, they seemed to people the wide\r\n",
      "rooms, as our little group passed slowly from one to another, with a\r\n",
      "dim expectant presence. We had thus, in spite of everything, a wonderful\r\n",
      "hour of it. Mr. Searle at once assumed the part of cicerone, and--I had\r\n",
      "not hitherto done him justice--Mr. Searle became almost agreeable. While\r\n",
      "I lingered behind with his sister he walked in advance with his kinsman.\r\n",
      "It was as if he had said: \"Well, if you want the old place you shall\r\n",
      "have it--so far as the impression goes!\" He spared us no thrill--I\r\n",
      "had almost said no pang--of that experience. Carrying a tall silver\r\n",
      "candlestick in his left hand, he raised it and lowered it and cast the\r\n",
      "light hither and thither, upon pictures and hangings and carvings and\r\n",
      "cornices. He knew his house to perfection. He touched upon a hundred\r\n",
      "traditions and memories, he threw off a cloud of rich reference to\r\n",
      "its earlier occupants. He threw off again, in his easy elegant way, a\r\n",
      "dozen--happily lighter--anecdotes. His relative attended with a brooding\r\n",
      "deference. Miss Searle and I meanwhile were not wholly silent.\r\n",

      "what he used to be.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wondered if he had been consciously practising on the sensibilities of\r\n",
      "this gentle creature. If he had I believed he had gained his point. But\r\n",
      "his position had in fact become to my sense so precarious that I hardly\r\n",
      "ventured to be glad. \"His better self just now seems again to be taking\r\n",
      "shape,\" I said. \"It will have been a good deed on your part if you help\r\n",

      "see in him now much to pity and to wonder at. But let him simply enjoy\r\n",
      "a while the grateful sense of your nearness and dearness. He'll be\r\n",

      "antiquities, just at such an angle that he caught the reflexion of his\r\n",
      "sister's person. It was evident that I too was under his attention, and\r\n",
      "was resolved I wouldn't be suspected for nothing. \"Miss Searle,\" I said\r\n",

      "spare her. \"Oh don't ask me--please don't!\" It was as if she were\r\n",
      "standing on the edge of a place where the ground had suddenly fallen\r\n",
      "away, and had been called upon to make a leap. I felt retreat was\r\n",
      "impossible, however, and that it was the greater kindness to assist her\r\n",
      "to jump.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You're in time to hear the most delightful story,\" Searle began to me\r\n",
      "as I rejoined him and his host. They were standing before an old sombre\r\n",
      "portrait of a lady in the dress of Queen Anne's time, whose ill-painted\r\n",
      "flesh-tints showed livid, in the candle-light, against her dark drapery\r\n",
      "and background. \"This is Mrs. Margaret Searle--a sort of Beatrix\r\n",
      "Esmond--qui se passait ses fantaisies. She married a paltry Frenchman,\r\n",
      "a penniless fiddler, in the teeth of her whole family. Pretty Mrs.\r\n",
      "Margaret, you must have been a woman of courage! Upon my word, she looks\r\n",
      "like Miss Searle! But pray go on. What came of it all?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our companion watched him with an air of distaste for his boisterous\r\n",
      "homage and of pity for his crude imagination. But he took up the tale\r\n",
      "with an effective dryness: \"I found a year ago, in a box of very old\r\n",
      "papers, a letter from the lady in question to a certain Cynthia Searle,\r\n",
      "her elder sister. It was dated from Paris and dreadfully ill-spelled.\r\n",
      "It contained a most passionate appeal for pecuniary assistance. She\r\n",
      "had just had a baby, she was starving and dreadfully neglected by her\r\n",
      "husband--she cursed the day she had left England. It was a most dismal\r\n",
      "production. I never heard she found means to return.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So much for marrying a Frenchman!\" I said sententiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our host had one of his waits. \"This is the only lady of the family who\r\n",
      "ever was taken in by an adventurer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Does Miss Searle know her history?\" asked my friend with a stare at the\r\n",
      "rounded whiteness of the heroine's cheek.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss Searle knows nothing!\" said our host with expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She shall know at least the tale of Mrs. Margaret,\" their guest\r\n",
      "returned; and he walked rapidly away in search of her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle and I pursued our march through the lighted rooms. \"You've\r\n",
      "found a cousin with a vengeance,\" I doubtless awkwardly enough laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah a vengeance?\" my entertainer stiffly repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean that he takes as keen an interest in your annals and possessions\r\n",
      "as yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh exactly so! He tells me he's a bad invalid,\" he added in a moment.\r\n",
      "\"I should never have supposed it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Within the past few hours he's a changed man. Your beautiful house,\r\n",
      "your extreme kindness, have refreshed him immensely.\" Mr. Searle uttered\r\n",
      "the vague ejaculation with which self-conscious Britons so often betray\r\n",
      "the concussion of any especial courtesy of speech. But he followed this\r\n",
      "by a sudden odd glare and the sharp declaration: \"I'm an honest man!\" I\r\n",
      "was quite prepared to assent; but he went on with a fury of frankness,\r\n",
      "as if it were the first time in his life he had opened himself to any\r\n",
      "one, as if the process were highly disagreeable and he were hurrying\r\n",
      "through it as a task. \"An honest man, mind you! I know nothing about Mr.\r\n",
      "Clement Searle! I never expected to see him. He has been to me a--a--!\"\r\n",
      "And here he paused to select a word which should vividly enough express\r\n",
      "what, for good or for ill, his kinsman represented. \"He has been to me\r\n",
      "an Amazement! I've no doubt he's a most amiable man. You'll not deny,\r\n",
      "however, that he's a very extraordinary sort of person. I'm sorry he's\r\n",
      "ill. I'm sorry he's poor. He's my fiftieth cousin. Well and good. I'm\r\n",
      "an honest man. He shall not have it to say that he wasn't received at my\r\n",
      "house.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He too, thank heaven, is an honest man!\" I smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why the devil then,\" cried Mr. Searle, turning almost fiercely on me,\r\n",
      "\"has he put forward this underhand claim to my property?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question, quite ringing out, flashed backward a gleam of light upon\r\n",
      "the demeanour of our host and the suppressed agitation of his sister. In\r\n",
      "an instant the jealous gentleman revealed itself. For a moment I was so\r\n",
      "surprised and scandalised at the directness of his attack that I lacked\r\n",
      "words to reply. As soon as he had spoken indeed Mr. Searle appeared to\r\n",
      "feel he had been wanting in form. \"Pardon me,\" he began afresh, \"if I\r\n",
      "speak of this matter with heat. But I've been more disgusted than I\r\n",
      "can say to hear, as I heard this morning from my solicitor, of the\r\n",
      "extraordinary proceedings of Mr. Clement Searle. Gracious goodness,\r\n",
      "sir, for what does the man take me? He pretends to the Lord knows what\r\n",
      "fantastic admiration for my place. Let him then show his respect for it\r\n",
      "by not taking too many liberties! Let him, with his high-flown parade\r\n",
      "of loyalty, imagine a tithe of what _I_ feel! I love my estate; it's my\r\n",
      "passion, my conscience, my life! Am I to divide it up at this time of\r\n",
      "day with a beggarly foreigner--a man without means, without appearance,\r\n",
      "without proof, a pretender, an adventurer, a chattering mountebank? I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I paused for some moments before speaking, to allow his passion fully to\r\n",
      "expend itself and to flicker up again if it chose; for so far as I was\r\n",
      "concerned in the whole awkward matter I but wanted to deal with him\r\n",
      "discreetly. \"Your apprehensions, sir,\" I said at last, \"your not\r\n",
      "unnatural surprise, perhaps, at the candour of our interest, have acted\r\n",
      "too much on your nerves. You're attacking a man of straw, a creature\r\n",
      "of unworthy illusion; though I'm sadly afraid you've wounded a man\r\n",
      "of spirit and conscience. Either my friend has no valid claim on your\r\n",
      "estate, in which case your agitation is superfluous; or he HAS a valid\r\n",
      "claim--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle seized my arm and glared at me; his pale face paler still\r\n",
      "with the horror of my suggestion, his great eyes of alarm glowing and\r\n",
      "his strange red hair erect and quivering. \"A valid claim!\" he shouted.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We had emerged into the great hall and stood facing the main doorway.\r\n",
      "The door was open into the portico, through the stone archway of which\r\n",
      "I saw the garden glitter in the blue light of a full moon. As the master\r\n",
      "of the house uttered the words I have just repeated my companion came\r\n",
      "slowly up into the porch from without, bareheaded, bright in the outer\r\n",
      "moonlight, dark in the shadow of the archway, and bright again in the\r\n",
      "lamplight at the entrance of the hall. As he crossed the threshold the\r\n",
      "butler made an appearance at the head of the staircase on our left,\r\n",
      "faltering visibly a moment at sight of Mr. Searle; after which, noting\r\n",
      "my friend, he gravely descended. He bore in his hand a small silver\r\n",
      "tray. On the tray, gleaming in the light of the suspended lamp, lay a\r\n",
      "folded note. Clement Searle came forward, staring a little and startled,\r\n",
      "I think, by some quick nervous prevision of a catastrophe. The butler\r\n",
      "applied the match to the train. He advanced to my fellow visitor, all\r\n",
      "solemnly, with the offer of his missive. Mr. Searle made a movement as\r\n",
      "if to spring forward, but controlled himself. \"Tottenham!\" he called in\r\n",
      "a strident voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, sir!\" said Tottenham, halting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stand where you are. For whom is that note?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For Mr. Clement Searle,\" said the butler, staring straight before him\r\n",
      "and dissociating himself from everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who gave it to you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Horridge, sir.\" This personage, I afterwards learned, was our\r\n",
      "friend the housekeeper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who gave it Mrs. Horridge?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was on Tottenham's part just an infinitesimal pause before\r\n",
      "replying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" broke in Searle, his equilibrium, his ancient ease,\r\n",
      "completely restored by the crisis, \"isn't that rather my business?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What happens in my house is my business, and detestable things seem to\r\n",
      "be happening.\" Our host, it was clear, now so furiously detested them\r\n",
      "that I was afraid he would snatch the bone of contention without more\r\n",
      "ceremony. \"Bring me that thing!\" he cried; on which Tottenham stiffly\r\n",
      "moved to obey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Really this is too much!\" broke out my companion, affronted and\r\n",
      "helpless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So indeed it struck me, and before Mr. Searle had time to take the note\r\n",
      "I possessed myself of it. \"If you've no consideration for your sister\r\n",
      "let a stranger at least act for her.\" And I tore the disputed object\r\n",
      "into a dozen pieces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the name of decency, what does this horrid business mean?\" my\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Searle was about to open fire on him, but at that moment our hostess\r\n",
      "appeared on the staircase, summoned evidently by our high-pitched\r\n",
      "contentious voices. She had exchanged her dinner-dress for a dark\r\n",
      "wrapper, removed her ornaments and begun to disarrange her hair, a\r\n",
      "thick tress of which escaped from the comb. She hurried down with a\r\n",
      "pale questioning face. Feeling distinctly that, for ourselves, immediate\r\n",
      "departure was in the air, and divining Mr. Tottenham to be a person of\r\n",
      "a few deep-seated instincts and of much latent energy, I seized the\r\n",
      "opportunity to request him, sotto voce, to send a carriage to the door\r\n",
      "without delay. \"And put up our things,\" I added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our host rushed at his sister and grabbed the white wrist that escaped\r\n",
      "from the loose sleeve of her dress. \"What was in that note?\" he quite\r\n",
      "hissed at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Searle looked first at its scattered fragments and then at her\r\n",
      "cousin. \"Did you read it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, but I thank you for it!\" said Searle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her eyes, for an instant, communicated with his own as I think they had\r\n",
      "never, never communicated with any other source of meaning; then she\r\n",
      "transferred them to her brother's face, where the sense went out of\r\n",
      "them, only to leave a dull sad patience. But there was something even\r\n",
      "in this flat humility that seemed to him to mock him, so that he flushed\r\n",
      "crimson with rage and spite and flung her away. \"You always were an\r\n",
      "idiot! Go to bed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In poor Searle's face as well the gathered serenity had been by this\r\n",
      "time all blighted and distorted and the reflected brightness of his\r\n",
      "happy day turned to blank confusion. \"Have I been dealing these three\r\n",
      "hours with a madman?\" he woefully cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A madman, yes, if you will! A man mad with the love of his home and the\r\n",
      "sense of its stability. I've held my tongue till now, but you've been\r\n",
      "too much for me. Who the devil are you, and what and why and whence?\"\r\n",
      "the terrible little man continued. \"From what paradise of fools do you\r\n",
      "come that you fancy I shall make over to you, for the asking, a part\r\n",
      "of my property and my life? I'm forsooth, you ridiculous person, to go\r\n",
      "shares with you? Prove your preposterous claim! There isn't THAT in it!\"\r\n",
      "And he kicked one of the bits of paper on the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle received this broadside gaping. Then turning away he went and\r\n",
      "seated himself on a bench against the wall and rubbed his forehead\r\n",
      "amazedly. I looked at my watch and listened for the wheels of our\r\n",
      "carriage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his kinsman was too launched to pull himself up. \"Wasn't it enough\r\n",

      "my very house to intrigue with my sister?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My friend put his two hands to his face. \"Oh, oh, oh!\" he groaned while\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Go to bed, you fool!\" shrieked her brother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I've done what I could,\" Mr. Searle went on--\"but it's arrant folly to\r\n",
      "pretend to friendship when this abomination lies between us. You were\r\n",
      "welcome to my meat and my wine, but I wonder you could swallow them. The\r\n",
      "sight spoiled MY appetite!\" cried the master of Lackley with a laugh.\r\n",
      "\"Proceed with your trumpery case! My people in London are instructed and\r\n",
      "prepared.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shouldn't wonder if your case had improved a good deal since you gave\r\n",
      "it up,\" I was moved to observe to Searle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oho! you don't feign ignorance then?\" and our insane entertainer shook\r\n",
      "his shining head at me. \"It's very kind of you to give it up! Perhaps\r\n",
      "you'll also give up my sister!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle sat staring in distress at his adversary. \"Ah miserable man--I\r\n",
      "thought we had become such beautiful friends.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Boh, you hypocrite!\" screamed our host.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle seemed not to hear him. \"Am I seriously expected,\" he slowly and\r\n",
      "painfully pursued, \"to defend myself against the accusation of any real\r\n",
      "indelicacy--to prove I've done nothing underhand or impudent? Think what\r\n",
      "you please!\" And he rose, with an effort, to his feet. \"I know what YOU\r\n",
      "think!\" he added to Miss Searle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wheels of the carriage resounded on the gravel, and at the same\r\n",
      "moment a footman descended with our two portmanteaux. Mr. Tottenham\r\n",
      "followed him with our hats and coats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good God,\" our host broke out again, \"you're not going away?\"--an\r\n",
      "ejaculation that, after all that had happened, had the grandest\r\n",
      "comicality. \"Bless my soul,\" he then remarked as artlessly, \"of course\r\n",
      "you're going!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's perhaps well,\" said Miss Searle with a great effort, inexpressibly\r\n",
      "touching in one for whom great efforts were visibly new and strange,\r\n",
      "\"that I should tell you what my poor little note contained.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That matter of your note, madam,\" her brother interrupted, \"you and I\r\n",
      "will settle together!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let me imagine all sorts of kind things!\" Searle beautifully pleaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah too much has been imagined!\" she answered simply. \"It was only a\r\n",
      "word of warning. It was to tell you to go. I knew something painful was\r\n",
      "coming.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took his hat. \"The pains and the pleasures of this day,\" he said to\r\n",
      "his kinsman, \"I shall equally never forget. Knowing you,\" and he offered\r\n",
      "his hand to Miss Searle, \"has been the pleasure of pleasures. I hoped\r\n",
      "something more might have come of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A monstrous deal too much has come of it!\" Mr. Searle irrepressibly\r\n",
      "declared.\r\n",

      "His departing guest looked at him mildly, almost benignantly, from head\r\n",
      "to foot, and then with closed eyes and some collapse of strength, \"I'm\r\n",
      "afraid so, I can't stand more,\" he went on. I gave him my arm and we\r\n",
      "crossed the threshold. As we passed out I heard Miss Searle break into\r\n",
      "loud weeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall hear from each other yet, I take it!\" her brother pursued,\r\n",
      "harassing our retreat.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean to say you'll not prosecute?\" Mr. Searle kept it up. \"I\r\n",
      "shall force you to prosecute! I shall drag you into court, and you shall\r\n",
      "be beaten--beaten--beaten!\" Which grim reiteration followed us on our\r\n",
      "course.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We drove of course to the little wayside inn from which we had departed\r\n",
      "in the morning so unencumbered, in all broad England, either with\r\n",
      "enemies or friends. My companion, as the carriage rolled along, seemed\r\n",
      "overwhelmed and exhausted. \"What a beautiful horrible dream!\" he\r\n",
      "confusedly wailed. \"What a strange awakening! What a long long day! What\r\n",
      "a hideous scene! Poor me! Poor woman!\" When we had resumed possession of\r\n",
      "our two little neighbouring rooms I asked him whether Miss Searle's\r\n",
      "note had been the result of anything that had passed between them on\r\n",
      "his going to rejoin her. \"I found her on the terrace,\" he said, \"walking\r\n",
      "restlessly up and down in the moonlight. I was greatly excited--I\r\n",
      "hardly know what I said. I asked her, I think, if she knew the story of\r\n",
      "Margaret Searle. She seemed frightened and troubled, and she used\r\n",
      "just the words her brother had used--'I know nothing.' For the moment,\r\n",
      "somehow, I felt as a man drunk. I stood before her and told her, with\r\n",
      "great emphasis, how poor Margaret had married a beggarly foreigner--all\r\n",
      "in obedience to her heart and in defiance to her family. As I talked the\r\n",
      "sheeted moonlight seemed to close about us, so that we stood there in\r\n",
      "a dream, in a world quite detached. She grew younger, prettier, more\r\n",
      "attractive--I found myself talking all kinds of nonsense. Before I knew\r\n",
      "it I had gone very far. I was taking her hand and calling her 'Margaret,\r\n",
      "dear Margaret!' She had said it was impossible, that she could do\r\n",
      "nothing, that she was a fool, a child, a slave. Then with a sudden\r\n",
      "sense--it was odd how it came over me there--of the reality of my\r\n",
      "connexion with the place, I spoke of my claim against the estate. 'It\r\n",
      "exists,' I declared, 'but I've given it up. Be generous! Pay me for my\r\n",
      "sacrifice.' For an instant her face was radiant. 'If I marry you,'\r\n",
      "she asked, 'will it make everything right?' Of that I at once assured\r\n",
      "her--in our marriage the whole difficulty would melt away like a\r\n",
      "rain-drop in the great sea. 'Our marriage!' she repeated in wonder; and\r\n",
      "the deep ring of her voice seemed to wake us up and show us our folly.\r\n",
      "'I love you, but I shall never see you again,' she cried; and she\r\n",
      "hurried away with her face in her hands. I walked up and down the\r\n",
      "terrace for some moments, and then came in and met you. That's the only\r\n",
      "witchcraft I've used!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The poor man was at once so roused and so shaken by the day's events\r\n",
      "that I believed he would get little sleep. Conscious on my own part that\r\n",
      "I shouldn't close my eyes, I but partly undressed, stirred my fire\r\n",
      "and sat down to do some writing. I heard the great clock in the little\r\n",
      "parlour below strike twelve, one, half-past one. Just as the vibration\r\n",
      "of this last stroke was dying on the air the door of communication with\r\n",
      "Searle's room was flung open and my companion stood on the threshold,\r\n",
      "pale as a corpse, in his nightshirt, shining like a phantom against the\r\n",
      "darkness behind him. \"Look well at me!\" he intensely gasped; \"touch me,\r\n",
      "embrace me, revere me! You see a man who has seen a ghost!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gracious goodness, what do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Write it down!\" he went on. \"There, take your pen. Put it into dreadful\r\n",
      "words. How do I look? Am I human? Am I pale? Am I red? Am I speaking\r\n",
      "English? A ghost, sir! Do you understand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I confess there came upon me by contact a kind of supernatural shock. I\r\n",
      "shall always feel by the whole communication of it that I too have seen\r\n",
      "a ghost. My first movement--I can smile at it now--was to spring to the\r\n",
      "door, close it quickly and turn the key upon the gaping blackness from\r\n",
      "which Searle had emerged. I seized his two hands; they were wet with\r\n",
      "perspiration. I pushed my chair to the fire and forced him to sit down\r\n",
      "in it; then I got on my knees and held his hands as firmly as possible.\r\n",
      "They trembled and quivered; his eyes were fixed save that the pupil\r\n",
      "dilated and contracted with extraordinary force. I asked no questions,\r\n",
      "but waited there, very curious for what he would say. At last he spoke.\r\n",
      "\"I'm not frightened, but I'm--oh excited! This is life! This is living!\r\n",
      "My nerves--my heart--my brain! They're throbbing--don't you feel it? Do\r\n",
      "you tingle? Are you hot? Are you cold? Hold me tight--tight--tight! I\r\n",
      "shall tremble away into waves--into surges--and know all the secrets of\r\n",
      "things and all the reasons and all the mysteries!\" He paused a moment\r\n",
      "and then went on: \"A woman--as clear as that candle: no, far clearer! In\r\n",
      "a blue dress, with a black mantle on her head and a little black muff.\r\n",
      "Young and wonderfully pretty, pale and ill; with the sadness of all\r\n",
      "the women who ever loved and suffered pleading and accusing in her\r\n",
      "wet-looking eyes. God knows I never did any such thing! But she took me\r\n",
      "for my elder, for the other Clement. She came to me here as she would\r\n",
      "have come to me there. She wrung her hands and she spoke to me 'marry\r\n",
      "me!' she moaned; 'marry me and put an end to my shame!' I sat up in bed,\r\n",
      "just as I sit here, looked at her, heard her--heard her voice melt away,\r\n",
      "watched her figure fade away. Bless us and save us! Here I be!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I made no attempt either to explain or to criticise this extraordinary\r\n",
      "passage. It's enough that I yielded for the hour to the strange force\r\n",
      "of my friend's emotion. On the whole I think my own vision was the\r\n",
      "more interesting of the two. He beheld but the transient irresponsible\r\n",
      "spectre--I beheld the human subject hot from the spectral presence. Yet\r\n",
      "I soon recovered my judgement sufficiently to be moved again to try to\r\n",
      "guard him against the results of excitement and exposure. It was easily\r\n",
      "agreed that he was not for the night to return to his room, and I made\r\n",
      "him fairly comfortable in his place by my fire. Wishing above all to\r\n",
      "preserve him from a chill I removed my bedding and wrapped him in the\r\n",
      "blankets and counterpane. I had no nerves either for writing or for\r\n",
      "sleep; so I put out my lights, renewed the fuel and sat down on the\r\n",
      "opposite side of the hearth. I found it a great and high solemnity just\r\n",
      "to watch my companion. Silent, swathed and muffled to his chin, he sat\r\n",
      "rigid and erect with the dignity of his adventure. For the most part\r\n",
      "his eyes were closed; though from time to time he would open them with\r\n",
      "a steady expansion and stare, never blinking, into the flame, as if he\r\n",
      "again beheld without terror the image of the little woman with the muff.\r\n",
      "His cadaverous emaciated face, his tragic wrinkles intensified by the\r\n",
      "upward glow from the hearth, his distorted moustache, his extraordinary\r\n",
      "gravity and a certain fantastical air as the red light flickered over\r\n",
      "him, all re-enforced his fine likeness to the vision-haunted knight of\r\n",
      "La Mancha when laid up after some grand exploit. The night passed wholly\r\n",
      "without speech. Toward its close I slept for half an hour. When I awoke\r\n",
      "the awakened birds had begun to twitter and Searle, unperturbed, sat\r\n",
      "staring at me. We exchanged a long look, and I felt with a pang that his\r\n",
      "glittering eyes had tasted their last of natural sleep. \"How is it? Are\r\n",
      "you comfortable?\" I nevertheless asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fixed me for a long time without replying and then spoke with a\r\n",
      "weak extravagance and with such pauses between his words as might have\r\n",
      "represented the slow prompting of an inner voice. \"You asked me when\r\n",
      "you first knew me what I was. 'Nothing,' I said, 'nothing of any\r\n",
      "consequence.' Nothing I've always supposed myself to be. But I've\r\n",
      "wronged myself--I'm a great exception. I'm a haunted man!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If sleep had passed out of his eyes I felt with even a deeper pang that\r\n",
      "sanity had abandoned his spirit. From this moment I was prepared for\r\n",
      "the worst. There were in my friend, however, such confirmed habits of\r\n",
      "mildness that I found myself not in the least fearing he would prove\r\n",

      "my hands to help him out of his chair, and he retained them for some\r\n",
      "moments after rising to his feet, unable as he seemed to keep his\r\n",
      "balance. \"Well,\" he said, \"I've been once favoured, but don't think I\r\n",

      "the past age and the early attachment. Even as we stand here, they say,\r\n",

      "of rank abuses, of distinctions and privileges the most delicious and\r\n",
      "invidious. What cared I, who was a perfect gentleman and with my pockets\r\n",

      "misadventure had given place to an unruffled calm in which the scene\r\n",
      "about us was reflected as in an old-fashioned mirror. We took an\r\n",

      "floated down the current by idle punts and lounging in friendly couples\r\n",

      "must be a double, an infinite blessing. As my companion found himself\r\n",
      "less and less able to walk we repaired in turn to a series of gardens\r\n",
      "and spent long hours sitting in their greenest places. They struck us as\r\n",

      "English system. Locked in their antique verdure, guarded, as in the case\r\n",
      "of New College, by gentle battlements of silver-grey, outshouldering the\r\n",
      "matted leafage of undisseverable plants, filled with nightingales and\r\n",
      "memories, a sort of chorus of tradition; with vaguely-generous youths\r\n",
      "sprawling bookishly on the turf as if to spare it the injury of\r\n",
      "their boot-heels, and with the great conservative college countenance\r\n",
      "appealing gravely from the restless outer world, they seem places to\r\n",
      "lie down on the grass in for ever, in the happy faith that life is all\r\n",
      "a green old English garden and time an endless summer afternoon. This\r\n",
      "charmed seclusion was especially grateful to my friend, and his sense of\r\n",
      "it reached its climax, I remember, on one of the last of such occasions\r\n",
      "and while we sat in fascinated flanerie over against the sturdy back of\r\n",
      "Saint John's. The wide discreetly-windowed wall here perhaps broods upon\r\n",
      "the lawn with a more effective air of property than elsewhere. Searle\r\n",

      "of the general life arrive but to falter and die? Doesn't one feel the\r\n",
      "air just thick with arrested voices? It's well there should be such\r\n",
      "places, shaped in the interest of factitious needs, invented to minister\r\n",
      "to the book-begotten longing for a medium in which one may dream unwaked\r\n",
      "and believe unconfuted; to foster the sweet illusion that all's well in\r\n",
      "a world where so much is so damnable, all right and rounded, smooth and\r\n",

      "background of our own education, the deadly dry air in which we gasp for\r\n",
      "impressions and comparisons. I assent to it all with a sort of desperate\r\n",
      "calmness; I accept it with a dogged pride. We're nursed at the opposite\r\n",
      "pole. Naked come we into a naked world. There's a certain grandeur\r\n",
      "in the lack of decorations, a certain heroic strain in that young\r\n",
      "imagination of ours which finds nothing made to its hands, which has to\r\n",
      "invent its own traditions and raise high into our morning-air, with\r\n",
      "a ringing hammer and nails, the castles in which we dwell. Noblesse\r\n",
      "oblige--Oxford must damnably do so. What a horrible thing not to rise\r\n",
      "to such examples! If you pay the pious debt to the last farthing of\r\n",
      "interest you may go through life with her blessing; but if you let it\r\n",
      "stand unhonoured you're a worse barbarian than we! But for the better or\r\n",
      "worse, in a myriad private hearts, think how she must be loved! How the\r\n",
      "youthful sentiment of mankind seems visibly to brood upon her! Think of\r\n",
      "the young lives now taking colour in her cloisters and halls. Think of\r\n",
      "the centuries' tale of dead lads--dead alike with the end of the young\r\n",
      "days to which these haunts were a present world, and the close of\r\n",
      "the larger lives which the general mother-scene has dropped into less\r\n",
      "bottomless traps. What are those two young fellows kicking their heels\r\n",
      "over on the grass there? One of them has the Saturday Review; the\r\n",
      "other--upon my soul--the other has Artemus Ward! Where do they live,\r\n",
      "how do they live, to what end do they live? Miserable boys! How can they\r\n",
      "read Artemus Ward under those windows of Elizabeth? What do you think\r\n",
      "loveliest in all Oxford? The poetry of certain windows. Do you see that\r\n",
      "one yonder, the second of those lesser bays, with the broken cornice\r\n",
      "and the lattice? That used to be the window of my bosom friend a hundred\r\n",
      "years ago. Remind me to tell you the story of that broken cornice. Don't\r\n",
      "pretend it's not a common thing to have one's bosom friend at another\r\n",
      "college. Pray was I committed to common things? He was a charming\r\n",
      "fellow. By the way, he was a good deal like you. Of course his cocked\r\n",
      "hat, his long hair in a black ribbon, his cinnamon velvet suit and his\r\n",
      "flowered waistcoat made a difference. We gentlemen used to wear swords.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was really the touch of grace in my poor friend's divagations--the\r\n",
      "disheartened dandy had so positively turned rhapsodist and seer. I\r\n",
      "was particularly struck with his having laid aside the diffidence and\r\n",
      "self-consciousness of the first days of our acquaintance. He had become\r\n",
      "by this time a disembodied observer and critic; the shell of sense,\r\n",
      "growing daily thinner and more transparent, transmitted the tremor of\r\n",
      "his quickened spirit. He seemed to pick up acquaintances, in the course\r\n",
      "of our contemplations, merely by putting out his hand. If I left him for\r\n",
      "ten minutes I was sure to find him on my return in earnest conversation\r\n",
      "with some affable wandering scholar. Several young men with whom he had\r\n",
      "thus established relations invited him to their rooms and entertained\r\n",
      "him, as I gathered, with rather rash hospitality. For myself, I chose\r\n",
      "not to be present at these symposia; I shrank partly from being held\r\n",
      "in any degree responsible for his extravagance, partly from the pang of\r\n",
      "seeing him yield to champagne and an admiring circle. He reported such\r\n",
      "adventures with less keen a complacency than I had supposed he might\r\n",
      "use, but a certain method in his madness, a certain dignity in his\r\n",
      "desire to fraternise, appeared to save him from mischance. If they\r\n",
      "didn't think him a harmless lunatic they certainly thought him a\r\n",
      "celebrity of the Occident. Two things, however, grew evident--that he\r\n",
      "drank deeper than was good for him and that the flagrant freshness of\r\n",
      "his young patrons rather interfered with his predetermined sense of the\r\n",
      "element of finer romance. At the same time it completed his knowledge\r\n",
      "of the place. Making the acquaintance of several tutors and fellows,\r\n",
      "he dined in hall in half a dozen colleges, alluding afterwards to these\r\n",
      "banquets with religious unction. One evening after a participation\r\n",
      "indiscreetly prolonged he came back to the hotel in a cab, accompanied\r\n",
      "by a friendly undergraduate and a physician and looking deadly pale. He\r\n",
      "had swooned away on leaving table and remained so rigidly unconscious\r\n",
      "as much to agitate his banqueters. The following twenty-four hours he of\r\n",
      "course spent in bed, but on the third day declared himself strong enough\r\n",
      "to begin afresh. On his reaching the street his strength once more\r\n",
      "forsook him, so that I insisted on his returning to his room. He\r\n",
      "besought me with tears in his eyes not to shut him up. \"It's my last\r\n",
      "chance--I want to go back for an hour to that garden of Saint John's.\r\n",
      "Let me eat and drink--to-morrow I die.\" It seemed to me possible that\r\n",
      "with a Bath-chair the expedition might be accomplished. The hotel, it\r\n",
      "appeared, possessed such a convenience, which was immediately produced.\r\n",
      "It became necessary hereupon that we should have a person to propel the\r\n",
      "chair. As there was no one on the spot at liberty I was about to perform\r\n",
      "the office; but just as my patient had got seated and wrapped--he now\r\n",
      "had a perpetual chill--an elderly man emerged from a lurking-place near\r\n",
      "the door and, with a formal salute, offered to wait upon the gentleman.\r\n",
      "We assented, and he proceeded solemnly to trundle the chair before him.\r\n",
      "I recognised him as a vague personage whom I had observed to lounge\r\n",
      "shyly about the doors of the hotels, at intervals during our stay, with\r\n",
      "a depressed air of wanting employment and a poor semblance of finding\r\n",
      "it. He had once indeed in a half-hearted way proposed himself as an\r\n",
      "amateur cicerone for a tour through the colleges; and I now, as I\r\n",
      "looked at him, remembered with a pang that I had too curtly declined his\r\n",
      "ministrations. Since then his shyness, apparently, had grown less or\r\n",
      "his misery greater, for it was with a strange grim avidity that he\r\n",
      "now attached himself to our service. He was a pitiful image of shabby\r\n",
      "gentility and the dinginess of \"reduced circumstances.\" He would\r\n",
      "have been, I suppose, some fifty years of age; but his pale haggard\r\n",
      "unwholesome visage, his plaintive drooping carriage and the irremediable\r\n",
      "disarray of his apparel seemed to add to the burden of his days and\r\n",
      "tribulations. His eyes were weak and bloodshot, his bold nose was sadly\r\n",
      "compromised, and his reddish beard, largely streaked with grey, bristled\r\n",
      "under a month's neglect of the razor. In all this rusty forlornness\r\n",
      "lurked a visible assurance of our friend's having known better days.\r\n",
      "Obviously he was the victim of some fatal depreciation in the market\r\n",
      "value of pure gentility. There had been something terribly affecting in\r\n",
      "the way he substituted for the attempt to touch the greasy rim of his\r\n",
      "antiquated hat some such bow as one man of the world might make another.\r\n",
      "Exchanging a few words with him as we went I was struck with the\r\n",
      "decorum of his accent. His fine whole voice should have been congruously\r\n",
      "cracked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Take me by some long roundabout way,\" said Searle, \"so that I may see\r\n",
      "as many college-walls as possible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You know,\" I asked of our attendant, \"all these wonderful ins and\r\n",
      "outs?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I ought to, sir,\" he said, after a moment, with pregnant gravity. And\r\n",
      "as we were passing one of the colleges, \"That used to be my place,\" he\r\n",
      "added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At these words Searle desired him to stop and come round within sight.\r\n",
      "\"You say that's YOUR college?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The place might deny me, sir; but heaven forbid I should seem to take\r\n",
      "it ill of her. If you'll allow me to wheel you into the quad I'll show\r\n",
      "you my windows of thirty years ago.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle sat staring, his huge pale eyes, which now left nothing else\r\n",
      "worth mentioning in his wasted face, filled with wonder and pity. \"If\r\n",
      "you'll be so kind,\" he said with great deference. But just as this\r\n",
      "perverted product of a liberal education was about to propel him across\r\n",
      "the threshold of the court he turned about, disengaged the mercenary\r\n",
      "hands, with one of his own, from the back of the chair, drew their owner\r\n",
      "alongside and turned to me. \"While we're here, my dear fellow,\" he said,\r\n",
      "\"be so good as to perform this service. You understand?\" I gave our\r\n",
      "companion a glance of intelligence and we resumed our way. The latter\r\n",
      "showed us his window of the better time, where a rosy youth in a scarlet\r\n",
      "smoking-fez now puffed a cigarette at the open casement. Thence we\r\n",
      "proceeded into the small garden, the smallest, I believe, and certainly\r\n",
      "the sweetest, of all the planted places of Oxford. I pushed the chair\r\n",
      "along to a bench on the lawn, turned it round, toward the front of\r\n",
      "the college and sat down by it on the grass. Our attendant shifted\r\n",
      "mournfully from one foot to the other, his patron eyeing him\r\n",
      "open-mouthed. At length Searle broke out: \"God bless my soul, sir, you\r\n",
      "don't suppose I expect you to stand! There's an empty bench.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said our friend, who bent his joints to sit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You English are really fabulous! I don't know whether I most admire or\r\n",
      "most abominate you! Now tell me: who are you? what are you? what brought\r\n",
      "you to this?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The poor fellow blushed up to his eyes, took off his hat and wiped his\r\n",
      "forehead with an indescribable fabric drawn from his pocket. \"My name's\r\n",
      "Rawson, sir. Beyond that it's a long story.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I ask out of sympathy,\" said Searle. \"I've a fellow-feeling. If you're\r\n",
      "a poor devil I'm a poor devil as well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm the poorer devil of the two,\" said the stranger with an assurance\r\n",
      "for once presumptuous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Possibly. I suppose an English poor devil's the poorest of all\r\n",
      "poor devils. And then you've fallen from a height. From a gentleman\r\n",
      "commoner--is that what they called you?--to a propeller of Bath-chairs.\r\n",
      "Good heavens, man, the fall's enough to kill you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I didn't take it all at once, sir. I dropped a bit one time and a bit\r\n",
      "another.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's me, that's me!\" cried Searle with all his seriousness.\r\n",

      "\"Yes--there's a shade. But I'm at my last gasp, Mr. Rawson.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm at my last penny, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Literally, Mr. Rawson?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rawson shook his head with large loose bitterness. \"I've almost come\r\n",
      "to the point of drinking my beer and buttoning my coat figuratively; but\r\n",
      "I don't talk in figures.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fearing the conversation might appear to achieve something like gaiety\r\n",
      "at the expense of Mr. Rawson's troubles, I took the liberty of asking\r\n",
      "him, with all consideration, how he made a living.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't make a living,\" he answered with tearful eyes; \"I can't make\r\n",
      "a living. I've a wife and three children--and all starving, sir. You\r\n",
      "wouldn't believe what I've come to. I sent my wife to her mother's, who\r\n",
      "can ill afford to keep her, and came to Oxford a week ago, thinking I\r\n",
      "might pick up a few half-crowns by showing people about the colleges.\r\n",
      "But it's no use. I haven't the assurance. I don't look decent. They\r\n",
      "want a nice little old man with black gloves and a clean shirt and a\r\n",
      "silver-headed stick. What do I look as if I knew about Oxford, sir?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mercy on us,\" cried Searle, \"why didn't you speak to us before?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wanted to; half a dozen times I've been on the point of it. I knew\r\n",
      "you were Americans.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And Americans are rich!\" cried Searle, laughing. \"My dear Mr. Rawson,\r\n",
      "American as I am I'm living on charity.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I'm exactly not, sir! There it is. I'm dying for the lack of that\r\n",
      "same. You say you're a pauper, but it takes an American pauper to go\r\n",
      "bowling about in a Bath-chair. America's an easy country.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah me!\" groaned Searle. \"Have I come to the most delicious corner of\r\n",
      "the ancient world to hear the praise of Yankeeland?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Delicious corners are very well, and so is the ancient world,\" said Mr.\r\n",
      "Rawson; \"but one may sit here hungry and shabby, so long as one isn't\r\n",
      "too shabby, as well as elsewhere. You'll not persuade me that it's not\r\n",
      "an easier thing to keep afloat yonder than here. I wish _I_ were in\r\n",
      "Yankeeland, that's all!\" he added with feeble force. Then brooding for\r\n",
      "a moment on his wrongs: \"Have you a bloated brother? or you, sir? It\r\n",
      "matters little to you. But it has mattered to me with a vengeance!\r\n",
      "Shabby as I sit here I can boast that advantage--as he his five thousand\r\n",
      "a year. Being but a twelvemonth my elder he swaggers while I go thus.\r\n",
      "There's old England for you! A very pretty place for HIM!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Poor old England!\" said Searle softly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has your brother never helped you?\" I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A five-pound note now and then! Oh I don't say there haven't been times\r\n",
      "when I haven't inspired an irresistible sympathy. I've not been what I\r\n",
      "should. I married dreadfully out of the way. But the devil of it is that\r\n",
      "he started fair and I started foul; with the tastes, the desires, the\r\n",
      "needs, the sensibilities of a gentleman--and not another blessed 'tip.'\r\n",
      "I can't afford to live in England.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"THIS poor gentleman fancied a couple of months ago that he couldn't\r\n",
      "afford to live in America,\" I fondly explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'd 'swap'--do you call it?--chances with him!\" And Mr. Rawson looked\r\n",
      "quaintly rueful over his freedom of speech.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle sat supported there with his eyes closed and his face twitching\r\n",
      "for violent emotion, and then of a sudden had a glare of gravity. \"My\r\n",
      "friend, you're a dead failure! Be judged! Don't talk about 'swapping.'\r\n",
      "Don't talk about chances. Don't talk about fair starts and false starts.\r\n",
      "I'm at that point myself that I've a right to speak. It lies neither\r\n",
      "in one's chance nor one's start to make one a success; nor in anything\r\n",
      "one's brother--however bloated--can do or can undo. It lies in one's\r\n",
      "character. You and I, sir, have HAD no character--that's very plain.\r\n",
      "We've been weak, sir; as weak as water. Here we are for it--sitting\r\n",
      "staring in each other's faces and reading our weakness in each other's\r\n",
      "eyes. We're of no importance whatever, Mr. Rawson!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rawson received this sally with a countenance in which abject\r\n",
      "submission to the particular affirmed truth struggled with the\r\n",
      "comparative propriety of his general rebellion against fate. In the\r\n",
      "course of a minute a due self-respect yielded to the warm comfortable\r\n",
      "sense of his being relieved of the cares of an attitude. \"Go on, sir, go\r\n",
      "on,\" he said. \"It's wholesome doctrine.\" And he wiped his eyes with what\r\n",
      "seemed his sole remnant of linen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear, dear,\" sighed Searle, \"I've made you cry! Well, we speak as from\r\n",
      "man to man. I should be glad to think you had felt for a moment the\r\n",
      "side-light of that great undarkening of the spirit which precedes--which\r\n",
      "precedes the grand illumination of death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rawson sat silent a little, his eyes fixed on the ground and his\r\n",
      "well-cut nose but the more deeply dyed by his agitation. Then at last\r\n",
      "looking up: \"You're a very good-natured man, sir, and you'll never\r\n",
      "persuade me you don't come of a kindly race. Say what you please about a\r\n",
      "chance; when a man's fifty--degraded, penniless, a husband and father--a\r\n",
      "chance to get on his legs again is not to be despised. Something tells\r\n",
      "me that my luck may be in your country--which has brought luck to so\r\n",
      "many. I can come on the parish here of course, but I don't want to come\r\n",
      "on the parish. Hang it, sir, I want to hold up my head. I see thirty\r\n",
      "years of life before me yet. If only by God's help I could have a real\r\n",
      "change of air! It's a fixed idea of mine. I've had it for the last ten\r\n",
      "years. It's not that I'm a low radical. Oh I've no vulgar opinions. Old\r\n",
      "England's good enough for me, but I'm not good enough for old England.\r\n",
      "I'm a shabby man that wants to get out of a room full of staring\r\n",
      "gentlefolk. I'm for ever put to the blush. It's a perfect agony of\r\n",
      "spirit; everything reminds me of my younger and better self. The thing\r\n",
      "for me would be a cooling cleansing plunge into the unknowing and the\r\n",
      "unknown! I lie awake thinking of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle closed his eyes, shivering with a long-drawn tremor which I\r\n",
      "hardly knew whether to take for an expression of physical or of mental\r\n",
      "pain. In a moment I saw it was neither. \"Oh my country, my country,\r\n",
      "my country!\" he murmured in a broken voice; and then sat for some time\r\n",
      "abstracted and lost. I signalled our companion that it was time we\r\n",
      "should bring our small session to a close, and he, without hesitating,\r\n",
      "possessed himself of the handle of the Bath-chair and pushed it before\r\n",
      "him. We had got halfway home before Searle spoke or moved. Suddenly\r\n",
      "in the High Street, as we passed a chop-house from whose open doors we\r\n",
      "caught a waft of old-fashioned cookery and other restorative elements,\r\n",
      "he motioned us to halt. \"This is my last five pounds\"--and he drew a\r\n",
      "note from his pocket-book. \"Do me the favour, Mr. Rawson, to accept\r\n",
      "it. Go in there and order the best dinner they can give you. Call for a\r\n",
      "bottle of Burgundy and drink it to my eternal rest!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rawson stiffened himself up and received the gift with fingers\r\n",
      "momentarily irresponsive. But Mr. Rawson had the nerves of a gentleman.\r\n",
      "I measured the spasm with which his poor dispossessed hand closed upon\r\n",
      "the crisp paper, I observed his empurpled nostril convulsive under the\r\n",
      "other solicitation. He crushed the crackling note in his palm with a\r\n",
      "passionate pressure and jerked a spasmodic bow. \"I shall not do you the\r\n",
      "wrong, sir, of anything but the best!\" The next moment the door swung\r\n",
      "behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle sank again into his apathy, and on reaching the hotel I helped\r\n",
      "him to get to bed. For the rest of the day he lay without motion or\r\n",
      "sound and beyond reach of any appeal. The doctor, whom I had constantly\r\n",
      "in attendance, was sure his end was near. He expressed great surprise\r\n",
      "that he should have lasted so long; he must have been living for a\r\n",
      "month on the very dregs of his strength. Toward evening, as I sat by his\r\n",
      "bedside in the deepening dusk, he roused himself with a purpose I had\r\n",
      "vaguely felt gathering beneath his stupor. \"My cousin, my cousin,\" he\r\n",
      "said confusedly. \"Is she here?\" It was the first time he had spoken of\r\n",
      "Miss Searle since our retreat from her brother's house, and he continued\r\n",
      "to ramble. \"I was to have married her. What a dream! That day was like\r\n",
      "a string of verses--rhymed hours. But the last verse is bad measure.\r\n",
      "What's the rhyme to 'love'? ABOVE! Was she a simple woman, a kind sweet\r\n",
      "woman? Or have I only dreamed it? She had the healing gift; her touch\r\n",
      "would have cured my madness. I want you to do something. Write three\r\n",
      "lines, three words: 'Good-bye; remember me; be happy.'\" And then after\r\n",
      "a long pause: \"It's strange a person in my state should have a wish. Why\r\n",
      "should one eat one's breakfast the day one's hanged? What a creature\r\n",
      "is man! What a farce is life! Here I lie, worn down to a mere throbbing\r\n",
      "fever-point; I breathe and nothing more, and yet I DESIRE! My desire\r\n",
      "lives. If I could see her! Help me out with it and let me die.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Half an hour later, at a venture, I dispatched by post a note to Miss\r\n",
      "Searle: \"Your cousin is rapidly sinking. He asks to see you.\" I was\r\n",
      "conscious of a certain want of consideration in this act, since it would\r\n",
      "bring her great trouble and yet no power to face the trouble; but out\r\n",
      "of her distress I fondly hoped a sufficient force might be born. On the\r\n",
      "following day my friend's exhaustion had become so great that I began\r\n",
      "to fear his intelligence altogether broken up. But toward evening he\r\n",
      "briefly rallied, to maunder about many things, confounding in a sinister\r\n",
      "jumble the memories of the past weeks and those of bygone years. \"By the\r\n",
      "way,\" he said suddenly, \"I've made no will. I haven't much to bequeath.\r\n",
      "Yet I have something.\" He had been playing listlessly with a large\r\n",
      "signet-ring on his left hand, which he now tried to draw off. \"I leave\r\n",
      "you this\"--working it round and round vainly--\"if you can get it off.\r\n",
      "What enormous knuckles! There must be such knuckles in the mummies of\r\n",
      "the Pharaohs. Well, when I'm gone--! No, I leave you something more\r\n",
      "precious than gold--the sense of a great kindness. But I've a little\r\n",
      "gold left. Bring me those trinkets.\" I placed on the bed before him\r\n",
      "several articles of jewellery, relics of early foppery: his watch\r\n",
      "and chain, of great value, a locket and seal, some odds and ends\r\n",
      "of goldsmith's work. He trifled with them feebly for some moments,\r\n",
      "murmuring various names and dates associated with them. At last, looking\r\n",
      "up with clearer interest, \"What has become,\" he asked, \"of Mr. Rawson?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You want to see him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How much are these things worth?\" he went on without heeding me. \"How\r\n",
      "much would they bring?\" And he weighed them in his weak hands. \"They're\r\n",
      "pretty heavy. Some hundred or so? Oh I'm richer than I thought!\r\n",
      "Rawson--Rawson--you want to get out of this awful England?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stepped to the door and requested the servant whom I kept in constant\r\n",
      "attendance in our adjacent sitting-room to send and ascertain if Mr.\r\n",
      "Rawson were on the premises. He returned in a few moments, introducing\r\n",
      "our dismal friend. Mr. Rawson was pale even to his nose and derived from\r\n",
      "his unaffectedly concerned state an air of some distinction. I led him\r\n",
      "up to the bed. In Searle's eyes, as they fell on him, there shone for a\r\n",
      "moment the light of a human message.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord have mercy!\" gasped Mr. Rawson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My friend,\" said Searle, \"there's to be one American the less--so let\r\n",
      "there be at the same time one the more. At the worst you'll be as good a\r\n",
      "one as I. Foolish me! Take these battered relics; you can sell them; let\r\n",
      "them help you on your way. They're gifts and mementoes, but this is a\r\n",
      "better use. Heaven speed you! May America be kind to you. Be kind, at\r\n",
      "the last, to your own country!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Really this is too much; I can't,\" the poor man protested, almost\r\n",
      "scared and with tears in his eyes. \"Do come round and get well and I'll\r\n",
      "stop here. I'll stay with you and wait on you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I'm booked for my journey, you for yours. I hope you don't mind the\r\n",
      "voyage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rawson exhaled a groan of helpless gratitude, appealing piteously\r\n",
      "from so strange a windfall. \"It's like the angel of the Lord who bids\r\n",
      "people in the Bible to rise and flee!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Searle had sunk back upon his pillow, quite used up; I led Mr. Rawson\r\n",
      "back into the sitting-room, where in three words I proposed to him\r\n",
      "a rough valuation of our friend's trinkets. He assented with perfect\r\n",
      "good-breeding; they passed into my possession and a second bank-note\r\n",
      "into his.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the collapse into which this wondrous exercise of his imagination\r\n",
      "had plunged him my charge then gave few signs of being likely to emerge.\r\n",
      "He breathed, as he had said, and nothing more. The twilight deepened; I\r\n",
      "lighted the night-lamp. The doctor sat silent and official at the foot\r\n",
      "of the bed; I resumed my constant place near the head. Suddenly our\r\n",
      "patient opened his eyes wide. \"She'll not come,\" he murmured. \"Amen!\r\n",
      "she's an English sister.\" Five minutes passed; he started forward.\r\n",
      "\"She's come, she's here!\" he confidently quavered. His words conveyed to\r\n",
      "my mind so absolute an assurance that I lightly rose and passed into the\r\n",
      "sitting-room. At the same moment, through the opposite door, the\r\n",
      "servant introduced a lady. A lady, I say; for an instant she was simply\r\n",
      "such--tall pale dressed in deep mourning. The next instant I had uttered\r\n",
      "her name--\"Miss Searle!\" She looked ten years older.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She met me with both hands extended and an immense question in her\r\n",
      "face. \"He has just announced you,\" I said. And then with a fuller\r\n",
      "consciousness of the change in her dress and countenance: \"What has\r\n",
      "happened?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh death, death!\" she wailed. \"You and I are left.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There came to me with her words a sickening shock, the sense of poetic\r\n",
      "justice somehow cheated, defeated. \"Your brother?\" I panted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She laid her hand on my arm and I felt its pressure deepen as she spoke.\r\n",
      "\"He was thrown from his horse in the park. He died on the spot. Six days\r\n",
      "have passed. Six months!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She accepted my support and a moment later we had entered the room and\r\n",
      "approached the bedside, from which the doctor withdrew. Searle opened\r\n",
      "his eyes and looked at her from head to foot. Suddenly he seemed to make\r\n",
      "out her mourning. \"Already!\" he cried audibly and with a smile, as I\r\n",
      "felt, of pleasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She dropped on her knees and took his hand. \"Not for you, cousin,\" she\r\n",
      "whispered. \"For my poor brother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He started, in all his deathly longitude, as with a galvanic shock.\r\n",
      "\"Dead! HE dead! Life itself!\" And then after a moment and with a slight\r\n",
      "rising inflexion: \"You're free?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Free, cousin. Too sadly free. And now--NOW--with what use for freedom?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked steadily into her eyes, dark in the heavy shadow of her musty\r\n",
      "mourning-veil. \"For me wear colours!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a moment more death had come, the doctor had silently attested it,\r\n",
      "and she had burst into sobs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We buried him in the little churchyard in which he had expressed the\r\n",

      "the little tower than which none in all England has a softer and hoarier\r\n",

      "The view from the terrace at Saint-Germain-en-Laye is immense and\r\n",
      "famous. Paris lies spread before you in dusky vastness, domed and\r\n",
      "fortified, glittering here and there through her light vapours and\r\n",
      "girdled with her silver Seine. Behind you is a park of stately symmetry,\r\n",
      "and behind that a forest where you may lounge through turfy avenues and\r\n",
      "light-chequered glades and quite forget that you are within half an\r\n",
      "hour of the boulevards. One afternoon, however, in mid-spring, some five\r\n",
      "years ago, a young man seated on the terrace had preferred to keep this\r\n",
      "in mind. His eyes were fixed in idle wistfulness on the mighty human\r\n",
      "hive before him. He was fond of rural things, and he had come to\r\n",
      "Saint-Germain a week before to meet the spring halfway; but though he\r\n",
      "could boast of a six months' acquaintance with the great city he never\r\n",
      "looked at it from his present vantage without a sense of curiosity still\r\n",
      "unappeased. There were moments when it seemed to him that not to be\r\n",
      "there just then was to miss some thrilling chapter of experience. And\r\n",
      "yet his winter's experience had been rather fruitless and he had closed\r\n",
      "the book almost with a yawn. Though not in the least a cynic he was what\r\n",
      "one may call a disappointed observer, and he never chose the right-hand\r\n",
      "road without beginning to suspect after an hour's wayfaring that the\r\n",
      "left would have been the better. He now had a dozen minds to go to Paris\r\n",
      "for the evening, to dine at the Cafe Brebant and repair afterwards to\r\n",
      "the Gymnase and listen to the latest exposition of the duties of the\r\n",
      "injured husband. He would probably have risen to execute this project if\r\n",
      "he had not noticed a little girl who, wandering along the terrace,\r\n",
      "had suddenly stopped short and begun to gaze at him with round-eyed\r\n",
      "frankness. For a moment he was simply amused, the child's face denoting\r\n",
      "such helpless wonderment; the next he was agreeably surprised. \"Why this\r\n",
      "is my friend Maggie,\" he said; \"I see you've not forgotten me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maggie, after a short parley, was induced to seal her remembrance with\r\n",
      "a kiss. Invited then to explain her appearance at Saint-Germain, she\r\n",
      "embarked on a recital in which the general, according to the infantine\r\n",
      "method, was so fatally sacrificed to the particular that Longmore looked\r\n",
      "about him for a superior source of information. He found it in Maggie's\r\n",
      "mamma, who was seated with another lady at the opposite end of the\r\n",
      "terrace; so, taking the child by the hand, he led her back to her\r\n",
      "companions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maggie's mamma was a young American lady, as you would immediately have\r\n",
      "perceived, with a pretty and friendly face and a great elegance of fresh\r\n",
      "finery. She greeted Longmore with amazement and joy, mentioning his name\r\n",
      "to her friend and bidding him bring a chair and sit with them. The other\r\n",
      "lady, in whom, though she was equally young and perhaps even prettier,\r\n",
      "muslins and laces and feathers were less of a feature, remained silent,\r\n",
      "stroking the hair of the little girl, whom she had drawn against her\r\n",
      "knee. She had never heard of Longmore, but she now took in that her\r\n",
      "companion had crossed the ocean with him, had met him afterwards in\r\n",
      "travelling and--having left her husband in Wall Street--was indebted\r\n",
      "to him for sundry services. Maggie's mamma turned from time to time and\r\n",
      "smiled at this lady with an air of invitation; the latter smiled back\r\n",
      "and continued gracefully to say nothing. For ten minutes, meanwhile,\r\n",
      "Longmore felt a revival of interest in his old acquaintance; then (as\r\n",
      "mild riddles are more amusing than mere commonplaces) it gave way to\r\n",
      "curiosity about her friend. His eyes wandered; her volubility shook a\r\n",
      "sort of sweetness out of the friend's silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stranger was perhaps not obviously a beauty nor obviously an\r\n",
      "American, but essentially both for the really seeing eye. She was slight\r\n",
      "and fair and, though naturally pale, was delicately flushed just now,\r\n",
      "as by the effect of late agitation. What chiefly struck Longmore in her\r\n",
      "face was the union of a pair of beautifully gentle, almost languid grey\r\n",
      "eyes with a mouth that was all expression and intention. Her forehead\r\n",
      "was a trifle more expansive than belongs to classic types, and her thick\r\n",
      "brown hair dressed out of the fashion, just then even more ugly than\r\n",
      "usual. Her throat and bust were slender, but all the more in harmony\r\n",
      "with certain rapid charming movements of the head, which she had a\r\n",
      "way of throwing back every now and then with an air of attention and a\r\n",
      "sidelong glance from her dove-like eyes. She seemed at once alert\r\n",
      "and indifferent, contemplative and restless, and Longmore very soon\r\n",
      "discovered that if she was not a brilliant beauty she was at least a\r\n",
      "most attaching one. This very impression made him magnanimous. He was\r\n",
      "certain he had interrupted a confidential conversation, and judged it\r\n",
      "discreet to withdraw, having first learned from Maggie's mamma--Mrs.\r\n",
      "Draper--that she was to take the six o'clock train back to Paris. He\r\n",
      "promised to meet her at the station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He kept his appointment, and Mrs. Draper arrived betimes, accompanied\r\n",
      "by her friend. The latter, however, made her farewells at the door and\r\n",
      "drove away again, giving Longmore time only to raise his hat. \"Who\r\n",
      "is she?\" he asked with visible ardour as he brought the traveller her\r\n",
      "tickets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come and see me to-morrow at the Hotel de l'Empire,\" she answered,\r\n",
      "\"and I'll tell you all about her.\" The force of this offer in making\r\n",
      "him punctual at the Hotel de l'Empire Longmore doubtless never exactly\r\n",
      "measured; and it was perhaps well he was vague, for he found his friend,\r\n",
      "who was on the point of leaving Paris, so distracted by procrastinating\r\n",
      "milliners and perjured lingeres that coherence had quite deserted her.\r\n",
      "\"You must find Saint-Germain dreadfully dull,\" she nevertheless had the\r\n",
      "presence of mind to say as he was going. \"Why won't you come with me to\r\n",
      "London?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Introduce me to Madame de Mauves,\" he answered, \"and Saint-Germain will\r\n",
      "quite satisfy me.\" All he had learned was the lady's name and residence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah she, poor woman, won't make your affair a carnival. She's very\r\n",
      "unhappy,\" said Mrs. Draper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore's further enquiries were arrested by the arrival of a young\r\n",
      "lady with a bandbox; but he went away with the promise of a note of\r\n",
      "introduction, to be immediately dispatched to him at Saint-Germain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then waited a week, but the note never came, and he felt how little\r\n",
      "it was for Mrs. Draper to complain of engagements unperformed. He\r\n",
      "lounged on the terrace and walked in the forest, studied suburban street\r\n",
      "life and made a languid attempt to investigate the records of the court\r\n",
      "of the exiled Stuarts; but he spent most of his time in wondering where\r\n",
      "Madame de Mauves lived and whether she ever walked on the terrace.\r\n",
      "Sometimes, he was at last able to recognise; for one afternoon toward\r\n",
      "dusk he made her out from a distance, arrested there alone and leaning\r\n",
      "against the low wall. In his momentary hesitation to approach her there\r\n",
      "was almost a shade of trepidation, but his curiosity was not chilled by\r\n",
      "such a measure of the effect of a quarter of an hour's acquaintance. She\r\n",
      "at once recovered their connexion, on his drawing near, and showed\r\n",
      "it with the frankness of a person unprovided with a great choice of\r\n",
      "contacts. Her dress, her expression, were the same as before; her charm\r\n",
      "came out like that of fine music on a second hearing. She soon made\r\n",
      "conversation easy by asking him for news of Mrs. Draper. Longmore told\r\n",
      "her that he was daily expecting news and after a pause mentioned the\r\n",
      "promised note of introduction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It seems less necessary now,\" he said--\"for me at least. But for you--I\r\n",
      "should have liked you to know the good things our friend would probably\r\n",
      "have been able to say about me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If it arrives at last,\" she answered, \"you must come and see me and\r\n",
      "bring it. If it doesn't you must come without it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, as she continued to linger through the thickening twilight, she\r\n",
      "explained that she was waiting for her husband, who was to arrive in the\r\n",
      "train from Paris and who often passed along the terrace on his way home.\r\n",
      "Longmore well remembered that Mrs. Draper had spoken of uneasy things\r\n",
      "in her life, and he found it natural to guess that this same husband was\r\n",
      "the source of them. Edified by his six months in Paris, \"What else is\r\n",
      "possible,\" he put it, \"for a sweet American girl who marries an unholy\r\n",
      "foreigner?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this quiet dependence on her lord's return rather shook his\r\n",
      "shrewdness, and it received a further check from the free confidence\r\n",
      "with which she turned to greet an approaching figure. Longmore\r\n",
      "distinguished in the fading light a stoutish gentleman, on the fair side\r\n",
      "of forty, in a high grey hat, whose countenance, obscure as yet against\r\n",
      "the quarter from which it came, mainly presented to view the large\r\n",
      "outward twist of its moustache. M. de Mauves saluted his wife with\r\n",
      "punctilious gallantry and, having bowed to Longmore, asked her several\r\n",
      "questions in French. Before taking his offered arm to walk to their\r\n",
      "carriage, which was in waiting at the gate of the terrace, she\r\n",
      "introduced our hero as a friend of Mrs. Draper and also a fellow\r\n",
      "countryman, whom she hoped they might have the pleasure of seeing, as\r\n",
      "she said, chez eux. M. de Mauves responded briefly, but civilly, in fair\r\n",
      "English, and led his wife away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore watched him as he went, renewing the curl of his main facial\r\n",
      "feature--watched him with an irritation devoid of any mentionable\r\n",
      "ground. His one pretext for gnashing his teeth would have been in his\r\n",
      "apprehension that this gentleman's worst English might prove a matter to\r\n",
      "shame his own best French. For reasons involved apparently in the very\r\n",
      "structure of his being Longmore found a colloquial use of that idiom\r\n",
      "as insecure as the back of a restive horse, and was obliged to take his\r\n",
      "exercise, as he was aware, with more tension than grace. He reflected\r\n",
      "meanwhile with comfort that Madame de Mauves and he had a common tongue,\r\n",
      "and his anxiety yielded to his relief at finding on his table that\r\n",
      "evening a letter from Mrs. Draper. It enclosed a short formal missive to\r\n",
      "Madame de Mauves, but the epistle itself was copious and confidential.\r\n",
      "She had deferred writing till she reached London, where for a week, of\r\n",
      "course, she had found other amusements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think it's the sight of so many women here who don't look at all like\r\n",
      "her that has reminded me by the law of contraries of my charming friend\r\n",
      "at Saint-Germain and my promise to introduce you to her,\" she wrote.\r\n",
      "\"I believe I spoke to you of her rather blighted state, and I wondered\r\n",
      "afterwards whether I hadn't been guilty of a breach of confidence. But\r\n",
      "you would certainly have arrived at guesses of your own, and, besides,\r\n",
      "she has never told me her secrets. The only one she ever pretended to\r\n",
      "was that she's the happiest creature in the world, after assuring me\r\n",
      "of which, poor thing, she went off into tears; so that I prayed to be\r\n",
      "delivered from such happiness. It's the miserable story of an American\r\n",
      "girl born neither to submit basely nor to rebel crookedly marrying a\r\n",
      "shining sinful Frenchman who believes a woman must do one or the other\r\n",
      "of those things. The lightest of US have a ballast that they can't\r\n",
      "imagine, and the poorest a moral imagination that they don't require.\r\n",
      "She was romantic and perverse--she thought the world she had been\r\n",
      "brought up in too vulgar or at least too prosaic. To have a decent\r\n",
      "home-life isn't perhaps the greatest of adventures; but I think she\r\n",
      "wishes nowadays she hadn't gone in quite so desperately for thrills. M.\r\n",
      "de Mauves cared of course for nothing but her money, which he's spending\r\n",
      "royally on his menus plaisirs. I hope you appreciate the compliment\r\n",
      "I pay you when I recommend you to go and cheer up a lady domestically\r\n",
      "dejected. Believe me, I've given no other man a proof of this esteem; so\r\n",
      "if you were to take me in an inferior sense I would never speak to you\r\n",
      "again. Prove to this fine sore creature that our manners may have all\r\n",
      "the grace without wanting to make such selfish terms for it. She avoids\r\n",
      "society and lives quite alone, seeing no one but a horrible French\r\n",
      "sister-in-law. Do let me hear that you've made her patience a little\r\n",
      "less absent-minded. Make her WANT to forget; make her like you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This ingenious appeal left the young man uneasy. He found himself in\r\n",
      "presence of more complications than had been in his reckoning. To call\r\n",
      "on Madame de Mauves with his present knowledge struck him as akin to\r\n",
      "fishing in troubled waters. He was of modest composition, and yet he\r\n",
      "asked himself whether an appearance of attentions from any gallant\r\n",
      "gentleman mightn't give another twist to her tangle. A flattering sense\r\n",
      "of unwonted opportunity, however--of such a possible value constituted\r\n",
      "for him as he had never before been invited to rise to--made him with\r\n",
      "the lapse of time more confident, possibly more reckless. It was too\r\n",
      "inspiring not to act upon the idea of kindling a truer light in his fair\r\n",
      "countrywoman's slow smile, and at least he hoped to persuade her that\r\n",
      "even a raw representative of the social order she had not done justice\r\n",
      "to was not necessarily a mere fortuitous collocation of atoms. He\r\n",

      "She had been placed for her education, fourteen years before, in a\r\n",
      "Parisian convent, by a widowed mammma who was fonder of Homburg and\r\n",
      "Nice than of letting out tucks in the frocks of a vigorously growing\r\n",
      "daughter. Here, besides various elegant accomplishments--the art of\r\n",
      "wearing a train, of composing a bouquet, of presenting a cup of tea--she\r\n",
      "acquired a certain turn of the imagination which might have passed for\r\n",
      "a sign of precocious worldliness. She dreamed of marrying a man of\r\n",
      "hierarchical \"rank\"--not for the pleasure of hearing herself called\r\n",
      "Madame la Vicomtesse, for which it seemed to her she should never\r\n",
      "greatly care, but because she had a romantic belief that the enjoyment\r\n",
      "of inherited and transmitted consideration, consideration attached to\r\n",
      "the fact of birth, would be the direct guarantee of an ideal delicacy\r\n",
      "of feeling. She supposed it would be found that the state of being noble\r\n",
      "does actually enforce the famous obligation. Romances are rarely worked\r\n",
      "out in such transcendent good faith, and Euphemia's excuse was the prime\r\n",
      "purity of her moral vision. She was essentially incorruptible, and she\r\n",
      "took this pernicious conceit to her bosom very much as if it had been a\r\n",
      "dogma revealed by a white-winged angel. Even after experience had given\r\n",
      "her a hundred rude hints she found it easier to believe in fables,\r\n",
      "when they had a certain nobleness of meaning, than in well-attested but\r\n",
      "sordid facts. She believed that a gentleman with a long pedigree must\r\n",
      "be of necessity a very fine fellow, and enjoyment of a chance to\r\n",
      "carry further a family chronicle begun ever so far back must be, as\r\n",
      "a consciousness, a source of the most beautiful impulses. It wasn't\r\n",
      "therefore only that noblesse oblige, she thought, as regards yourself,\r\n",
      "but that it ensures as nothing else does in respect to your wife. She\r\n",
      "had never, at the start, spoken to a nobleman in her life, and these\r\n",
      "convictions were but a matter of extravagant theory. They were the\r\n",
      "fruit, in part, of the perusal of various Ultramontane works of\r\n",
      "fiction--the only ones admitted to the convent library--in which the\r\n",
      "hero was always a Legitimist vicomte who fought duels by the dozen but\r\n",
      "went twice a month to confession; and in part of the strong social scent\r\n",
      "of the gossip of her companions, many of them filles de haut lieu who,\r\n",
      "in the convent-garden, after Sundays at home, depicted their brothers\r\n",
      "and cousins as Prince Charmings and young Paladins. Euphemia listened\r\n",
      "and said nothing; she shrouded her visions of matrimony under a coronet\r\n",
      "in the silence that mostly surrounds all ecstatic faith. She was not\r\n",
      "of that type of young lady who is easily induced to declare that her\r\n",
      "husband must be six feet high and a little near-sighted, part his hair\r\n",
      "in the middle and have amber lights in his beard. To her companions her\r\n",
      "flights of fancy seemed short, rather, and poor and untutored; and\r\n",
      "even the fact that she was a sprig of the transatlantic democracy never\r\n",
      "sufficiently explained her apathy on social questions. She had a mental\r\n",
      "image of that son of the Crusaders who was to suffer her to adore him,\r\n",
      "but like many an artist who has produced a masterpiece of idealisation\r\n",
      "she shrank from exposing it to public criticism. It was the portrait of\r\n",
      "a gentleman rather ugly than handsome and rather poor than rich. But his\r\n",
      "ugliness was to be nobly expressive and his poverty delicately proud.\r\n",
      "She had a fortune of her own which, at the proper time, after fixing on\r\n",
      "her in eloquent silence those fine eyes that were to soften the feudal\r\n",
      "severity of his visage, he was to accept with a world of stifled\r\n",
      "protestations. One condition alone she was to make--that he should have\r\n",
      "\"race\" in a state as documented as it was possible to have it. On this\r\n",
      "she would stake her happiness; and it was so to happen that several\r\n",
      "accidents conspired to give convincing colour to this artless\r\n",
      "philosophy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Inclined to long pauses and slow approaches herself, Euphemia was\r\n",
      "a great sitter at the feet of breathless volubility, and there were\r\n",
      "moments when she fairly hung upon the lips of Mademoiselle Marie de\r\n",
      "Mauves. Her intimacy with this chosen schoolmate was founded on the\r\n",
      "perception--all her own--that their differences were just the right\r\n",
      "ones. Mademoiselle de Mauves was very positive, very shrewd,\r\n",
      "very ironical, very French--everything that Euphemia felt herself\r\n",
      "unpardonable for not being. During her Sundays en ville she had examined\r\n",
      "the world and judged it, and she imparted her impressions to our\r\n",
      "attentive heroine with an agreeable mixture of enthusiasm and\r\n",
      "scepticism. She was moreover a handsome and well-grown person, on whom\r\n",
      "Euphemia's ribbons and trinkets had a trick of looking better than on\r\n",
      "their slender proprietress. She had finally the supreme merit of being\r\n",
      "a rigorous example of the virtue of exalted birth, having, as she did,\r\n",
      "ancestors honourably mentioned by Joinville and Commines, and a stately\r\n",
      "grandmother with a hooked nose who came up with her after the holidays\r\n",
      "from a veritable castel in Auvergne. It seemed to our own young woman\r\n",
      "that these attributes made her friend more at home in the world than if\r\n",
      "she had been the daughter of even the most prosperous grocer. A certain\r\n",
      "aristocratic impudence Mademoiselle de Mauves abundantly possessed,\r\n",
      "and her raids among her friend's finery were quite in the spirit of her\r\n",
      "baronial ancestors in the twelfth century--a spirit regarded by\r\n",
      "Euphemia but as a large way of understanding friendship, a freedom from\r\n",
      "conformities without style, and one that would sooner or later express\r\n",
      "itself in acts of surprising magnanimity. There doubtless prevailed\r\n",
      "in the breast of Mademoiselle de Mauves herself a dimmer vision of the\r\n",
      "large securities that Euphemia envied her. She was to become later in\r\n",
      "life so accomplished a schemer that her sense of having further heights\r\n",
      "to scale might well have waked up early. The especially fine appearance\r\n",
      "made by our heroine's ribbons and trinkets as her friend wore them\r\n",
      "ministered to pleasure on both sides, and the spell was not of a nature\r\n",

      "more fine lights and shades she seemed to behold in this masterpiece of\r\n",
      "nature. M. de Mauves's character indeed, whether from a sense of being\r\n",
      "so generously and intensely taken for granted, or for reasons which bid\r\n",
      "graceful defiance to analysis, had never been so much on show, even to\r\n",
      "the very casual critic lodged, as might be said, in an out-of-the-way\r\n",
      "corner of it; it seemed really to reflect the purity of Euphemia's pious\r\n",

      "much the better; but he had left a meagre margin for it and would hardly\r\n",
      "have admitted that so excellent a match could be improved by it. He was\r\n",
      "a robust and serene sceptic, and it was a singular fate for a man who\r\n",
      "believed in nothing to be so tenderly believed in. What his original\r\n",
      "faith had been he could hardly have told you, for as he came back to his\r\n",

      "was a thoroughly perverse creature and overlaid with more corruptions\r\n",

      "flight. Ten years' pursuit of pleasure, which a bureau full of unpaid\r\n",
      "bills was all he had to show for, had pretty well stifled the natural\r\n",
      "lad whose violent will and generous temper might have been shaped by\r\n",
      "a different pressure to some such showing as would have justified a\r\n",
      "romantic faith. So should he have exhaled the natural fragrance of a\r\n",
      "late-blooming flower of hereditary honour. His violence indeed had been\r\n",
      "subdued and he had learned to be irreproachably polite; but he had lost\r\n",
      "the fineness of his generosity, and his politeness, which in the long\r\n",
      "run society paid for, was hardly more than a form of luxurious egotism,\r\n",
      "like his fondness for ciphered pocket-handkerchiefs, lavender gloves\r\n",
      "and other fopperies by which shopkeepers remained out of pocket. In\r\n",
      "after-years he was terribly polite to his wife. He had formed himself,\r\n",
      "as the phrase was, and the form prescribed to him by the society into\r\n",
      "which his birth and his tastes had introduced him was marked by some\r\n",
      "peculiar features. That which mainly concerns us is its classification\r\n",
      "of the fairer half of humanity as objects not essentially different--say\r\n",
      "from those very lavender gloves that are soiled in an evening and\r\n",
      "thrown away. To do M. de Mauves justice, he had in the course of time\r\n",
      "encountered in the feminine character such plentiful evidence of its\r\n",
      "pliant softness and fine adjustability that idealism naturally seemed to\r\n",
      "him a losing game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Euphemia, as he lay on his sofa, struck him as by no means\r\n",
      "contradictory; she simply reminded him that very young women are\r\n",
      "generally innocent and that this is on the whole the most potent source\r\n",
      "of their attraction. Her innocence moved him to perfect consideration,\r\n",
      "and it seemed to him that if he shortly became her husband it would\r\n",
      "be exposed to a danger the less. Old Madame de Mauves, who flattered\r\n",
      "herself that in this whole matter she was very laudably rigid, might\r\n",
      "almost have taken a lesson from the delicacy he practised. For two or\r\n",
      "three weeks her grandson was well-nigh a blushing boy again. He watched\r\n",
      "from behind the Figaro, he admired and desired and held his tongue. He\r\n",
      "found himself not in the least moved to a flirtation; he had no wish\r\n",
      "to trouble the waters he proposed to transfuse into the golden cup of\r\n",
      "matrimony. Sometimes a word, a look, a gesture of Euphemia's gave him\r\n",
      "the oddest sense of being, or of seeming at least, almost bashful;\r\n",
      "for she had a way of not dropping her eyes according to the mysterious\r\n",
      "virginal mechanism, of not fluttering out of the room when she found him\r\n",
      "there alone, of treating him rather as a glorious than as a pernicious\r\n",
      "influence--a radiant frankness of demeanour in fine, despite an\r\n",
      "infinite natural reserve, which it seemed at once graceless not to be\r\n",
      "complimentary about and indelicate not to take for granted. In this way\r\n",
      "had been wrought in the young man's mind a vague unwonted resonance of\r\n",
      "soft impressions, as we may call it, which resembled the happy stir of\r\n",
      "the change from dreaming pleasantly to waking happily. His imagination\r\n",
      "was touched; he was very fond of music and he now seemed to give easy\r\n",
      "ear to some of the sweetest he had ever heard. In spite of the bore of\r\n",
      "being laid up with a lame knee he was in better humour than he had known\r\n",
      "for months; he lay smoking cigarettes and listening to the nightingales\r\n",
      "with the satisfied smile of one of his country neighbours whose big\r\n",
      "ox should have taken the prize at a fair. Every now and then, with an\r\n",
      "impatient suspicion of the resemblance, he declared himself pitifully\r\n",
      "bete; but he was under a charm that braved even the supreme penalty of\r\n",
      "seeming ridiculous. One morning he had half an hour's tete-a-tete with\r\n",
      "his grandmother's confessor, a soft-voiced old Abbe whom, for reasons of\r\n",
      "her own, Madame de Mauves had suddenly summoned and had left waiting in\r\n",
      "the drawing-room while she rearranged her curls. His reverence, going\r\n",
      "up to the old lady, assured her that M. le Comte was in a most edifying\r\n",
      "state of mind and the likeliest subject for the operation of grace. This\r\n",
      "was a theological interpretation of the count's unusual equanimity.\r\n",
      "He had always lazily wondered what priests were good for, and he now\r\n",
      "remembered, with a sense of especial obligation to the Abbe, that they\r\n",
      "were excellent for marrying people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A day or two after this he left off his bandages and tried to walk. He\r\n",
      "made his way into the garden and hobbled successfully along one of the\r\n",
      "alleys, but in the midst of his progress was pulled up by a spasm of\r\n",
      "pain which forced him to stop and call for help. In an instant Euphemia\r\n",
      "came tripping along the path and offered him her arm with the frankest\r\n",
      "solicitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not to the house,\" he said, taking it; \"further on, to the bosquet.\"\r\n",
      "This choice was prompted by her having immediately confessed that she\r\n",
      "had seen him leave the house, had feared an accident and had followed\r\n",
      "him on tiptoe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why didn't you join me?\" he had asked, giving her a look in which\r\n",
      "admiration was no longer disguised and yet felt itself half at the\r\n",
      "mercy of her replying that a jeune fille shouldn't be seen following a\r\n",
      "gentleman. But it drew a breath which filled its lungs for a long time\r\n",
      "afterwards when she replied simply that if she had overtaken him he\r\n",
      "might have accepted her arm out of politeness, whereas she wished to\r\n",
      "have the pleasure of seeing him walk alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bosquet was covered with an odorous tangle of blossoming creepers,\r\n",
      "and a nightingale overhead was shaking out love-notes with a profusion\r\n",

      "\"I've always heard that in America, when a man wishes to marry a\r\n",
      "young girl, he offers himself simply face to face and without\r\n",

      "who sees the wheel of fortune turning up her favourite event. But at the\r\n",
      "moment it had for her simply the proper gravity of the occasion: this\r\n",
      "was the way, she supposed, in which lucky young girls were addressed on\r\n",
      "their engagement by wise old women of quality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At her convent, to which she immediately returned, she found a letter\r\n",
      "from her mother which disconcerted her far more than the remarks of\r\n",
      "Madame de Mauves. Who were these people, Mrs. Cleve demanded, who had\r\n",
      "presumed to talk to her daughter of marriage without asking her leave?\r\n",
      "Questionable gentlefolk plainly; the best French people never did such\r\n",
      "things. Euphemia would return straightway to her convent, shut herself\r\n",
      "up and await her own arrival. It took Mrs. Cleve three weeks to\r\n",
      "travel from Nice to Paris, and during this time the young girl had\r\n",
      "no communication with her lover beyond accepting a bouquet of violets\r\n",
      "marked with his initials and left by a female friend. \"I've not brought\r\n",
      "you up with such devoted care,\" she declared to her daughter at their\r\n",
      "first interview, \"to marry a presumptuous and penniless Frenchman. I\r\n",
      "shall take you straight home and you'll please forget M. de Mauves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Cleve received that evening at her hotel a visit from this\r\n",
      "personage which softened her wrath but failed to modify her decision. He\r\n",
      "had very good manners, but she was sure he had horrible morals; and the\r\n",
      "lady, who had been a good-natured censor on her own account, felt a deep\r\n",
      "and real need to sacrifice her daughter to propriety. She belonged to\r\n",
      "that large class of Americans who make light of their native land\r\n",
      "in familiar discourse but are startled back into a sense of having\r\n",
      "blasphemed when they find Europeans taking them at their word. \"I know\r\n",
      "the type, my dear,\" she said to her daughter with a competent nod. \"He\r\n",
      "won't beat you. Sometimes you'll wish he would.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Euphemia remained solemnly silent, for the only answer she felt capable\r\n",
      "of making was that her mother's mind was too small a measure of things\r\n",
      "and her lover's type an historic, a social masterpiece that it took some\r\n",
      "mystic illumination to appreciate. A person who confounded him with the\r\n",
      "common throng of her watering-place acquaintance was not a person to\r\n",
      "argue with. It struck the girl she had simply no cause to plead; her\r\n",
      "cause was in the Lord's hands and in those of M. de Mauves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This agent of Providence had been irritated and mortified by Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cleve's opposition, and hardly knew how to handle an adversary who\r\n",
      "failed to perceive that a member of his family gave of necessity more\r\n",
      "than he received. But he had obtained information on his return to Paris\r\n",
      "which exalted the uses of humility. Euphemia's fortune, wonderful to\r\n",
      "say, was greater than its fame, and in view of such a prize, even a\r\n",
      "member of his family could afford to take a snubbing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man's tact, his deference, his urbane insistence, won a\r\n",
      "concession from Mrs. Cleve. The engagement was to be put off and her\r\n",
      "daughter was to return home, be brought out and receive the homage she\r\n",
      "was entitled to and which might well take a form representing peril to\r\n",
      "the suit of this first headlong aspirant. They were to exchange neither\r\n",
      "letters nor mementoes nor messages; but if at the end of two years\r\n",
      "Euphemia had refused offers enough to attest the permanence of her\r\n",
      "attachment he should receive an invitation to address her again. This\r\n",
      "decision was promulgated in the presence of the parties interested.\r\n",
      "The Count bore himself gallantly, looking at his young friend as if he\r\n",
      "expected some tender protestation. But she only looked at him silently\r\n",
      "in return, neither weeping nor smiling nor putting out her hand. On this\r\n",
      "they separated, and as M. de Mauves walked away he declared to himself\r\n",
      "that in spite of the confounded two years he was one of the luckiest\r\n",
      "of men--to have a fiancee who to several millions of francs added such\r\n",
      "strangely beautiful eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How many offers Euphemia refused but scantily concerns us--and how the\r\n",
      "young man wore his two years away. He found he required pastimes, and\r\n",
      "as pastimes were expensive he added heavily to the list of debts to be\r\n",
      "cancelled by Euphemia's fortune. Sometimes, in the thick of what he\r\n",
      "had once called pleasure with a keener conviction than now, he put to\r\n",
      "himself the case of their failing him after all; and then he remembered\r\n",
      "that last mute assurance of her pale face and drew a long breath of\r\n",
      "such confidence as he felt in nothing else in the world save his own\r\n",
      "punctuality in an affair of honour.\r\n",

      "At last, one morning, he took the express to Havre with a letter of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cleve's in his pocket, and ten days later made his bow to mother and\r\n",
      "daughter in New York. His stay was brief, and he was apparently unable\r\n",
      "to bring himself to view what Euphemia's uncle, Mr. Butterworth, who\r\n",
      "gave her away at the altar, called our great experiment of democratic\r\n",
      "self-government, in a serious light. He smiled at everything and seemed\r\n",
      "to regard the New World as a colossal plaisanterie. It is true that a\r\n",

      "Longmore's first visit seemed to open to him so large a range of quiet\r\n",
      "pleasure that he very soon paid a second, and at the end of a fortnight\r\n",
      "had spent uncounted hours in the little drawing-room which Madame de\r\n",
      "Mauves rarely quitted except to drive or walk in the forest. She\r\n",
      "lived in an old-fashioned pavilion, between a high-walled court and an\r\n",
      "excessively artificial garden, beyond whose enclosure you saw a long\r\n",
      "line of tree-tops. Longmore liked the garden and in the mild afternoons\r\n",
      "used to move his chair through the open window to the smooth terrace\r\n",
      "which overlooked it while his hostess sat just within. Presently she\r\n",
      "would come out and wander through the narrow alleys and beside the\r\n",
      "thin-spouting fountain, and at last introduce him to a private gate\r\n",
      "in the high wall, the opening to a lane which led to the forest.\r\n",
      "Hitherwards she more than once strolled with him, bareheaded and meaning\r\n",
      "to go but twenty rods, but always going good-naturedly further and often\r\n",
      "stretching it to the freedom of a promenade. They found many things to\r\n",
      "talk about, and to the pleasure of feeling the hours slip along\r\n",
      "like some silver stream Longmore was able to add the satisfaction of\r\n",
      "suspecting that he was a \"resource\" for Madame de Mauves. He had made\r\n",
      "her acquaintance with the sense, not wholly inspiring, that she was a\r\n",
      "woman with a painful twist in her life and that seeking her acquaintance\r\n",
      "would be like visiting at a house where there was an invalid who could\r\n",
      "bear no noise. But he very soon recognised that her grievance, if\r\n",
      "grievance it was, was not aggressive; that it was not fond of attitudes\r\n",
      "and ceremonies, and that her most earnest wish was to remember it as\r\n",
      "little as possible. He felt that even if Mrs. Draper hadn't told him\r\n",
      "she was unhappy he would have guessed it, and yet that he couldn't\r\n",
      "have pointed to his proof. The evidence was chiefly negative--she never\r\n",
      "alluded to her husband. Beyond this it seemed to him simply that her\r\n",
      "whole being was pitched in a lower key than harmonious Nature had\r\n",
      "designed; she was like a powerful singer who had lost her high notes.\r\n",
      "She never drooped nor sighed nor looked unutterable things; she dealt\r\n",
      "no sarcastic digs at her fate; she had in short none of the conscious\r\n",
      "graces of the woman wronged. Only Longmore was sure that her gentle\r\n",
      "gaiety was but the milder or sharper flush of a settled ache, and that\r\n",
      "she but tried to interest herself in his thoughts in order to escape\r\n",
      "from her own. If she had wished to irritate his curiosity and lead him\r\n",
      "to take her confidence by storm nothing could have served her purpose\r\n",
      "better than this studied discretion. He measured the rare magnanimity\r\n",
      "of self-effacement so deliberate, he felt how few women were capable of\r\n",
      "exchanging a luxurious woe for a thankless effort. Madame de Mauves,\r\n",
      "he himself felt, wasn't sweeping the horizon for a compensation or a\r\n",
      "consoler; she had suffered a personal deception that had disgusted her\r\n",
      "with persons. She wasn't planning to get the worth of her trouble back\r\n",
      "in some other way; for the present she was proposing to live with\r\n",
      "it peaceably, reputably and without scandal--turning the key on it\r\n",
      "occasionally as you would on a companion liable to attacks of insanity.\r\n",
      "Longmore was a man of fine senses and of a speculative spirit,\r\n",
      "leading-strings that had never been slipped. He began to regard his\r\n",
      "hostess as a figure haunted by a shadow which was somehow her intenser\r\n",
      "and more authentic self. This lurking duality in her put on for him an\r\n",
      "extraordinary charm. Her delicate beauty acquired to his eye the serious\r\n",
      "cast of certain blank-browed Greek statues; and sometimes when his\r\n",
      "imagination, more than his ear, detected a vague tremor in the tone in\r\n",
      "which she attempted to make a friendly question seem to have behind it\r\n",
      "none of the hollow resonance of absent-mindedness, his marvelling eyes\r\n",
      "gave her an answer more eloquent, though much less to the point, than\r\n",
      "the one she demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She supplied him indeed with much to wonder about, so that he fitted, in\r\n",
      "his ignorance, a dozen high-flown theories to her apparent history. She\r\n",
      "had married for love and staked her whole soul on it; of that he was\r\n",
      "convinced. She hadn't changed her allegiance to be near Paris and her\r\n",
      "base of supplies of millinery; he was sure she had seen her perpetrated\r\n",
      "mistake in a light of which her present life, with its conveniences for\r\n",
      "shopping and its moral aridity, was the absolute negation. But by what\r\n",
      "extraordinary process of the heart--through what mysterious intermission\r\n",
      "of that moral instinct which may keep pace with the heart even when this\r\n",
      "organ is making unprecedented time--had she fixed her affections on an\r\n",
      "insolently frivolous Frenchman? Longmore needed no telling; he knew that\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves was both cynical and shallow; these things were stamped\r\n",
      "on his eyes, his nose, his mouth, his voice, his gesture, his step. Of\r\n",
      "Frenchwomen themselves, when all was said, our young man, full of nursed\r\n",
      "discriminations, went in no small fear; they all seemed to belong to the\r\n",
      "type of a certain fine lady to whom he had ventured to present a letter\r\n",
      "of introduction and whom, directly after his first visit to her, he had\r\n",
      "set down in his note-book as \"metallic.\" Why should Madame de Mauves\r\n",
      "have chosen a Frenchwoman's lot--she whose nature had an atmospheric\r\n",
      "envelope absent even from the brightest metals? He asked her one day\r\n",
      "frankly if it had cost her nothing to transplant herself--if she weren't\r\n",
      "oppressed with a sense of irreconcileable difference from \"all these\r\n",
      "people.\" She replied nothing at first, till he feared she might think\r\n",
      "it her duty to resent a question that made light of all her husband's\r\n",
      "importances. He almost wished she would; it would seem a proof that\r\n",
      "her policy of silence had a limit. \"I almost grew up here,\" she said\r\n",
      "at last, \"and it was here for me those visions of the future took\r\n",
      "shape that we all have when we begin to think or to dream beyond mere\r\n",
      "playtime. As matters stand one may be very American and yet arrange it\r\n",
      "with one's conscience to live in Europe. My imagination perhaps--I had\r\n",
      "a little when I was younger--helped me to think I should find happiness\r\n",
      "here. And after all, for a woman, what does it signify? This isn't\r\n",
      "America, no--this element, but it's quite as little France. France is\r\n",
      "out there beyond the garden, France is in the town and the forest; but\r\n",
      "here, close about me, in my room and\"--she paused a moment--\"in my mind,\r\n",
      "it's a nameless, and doubtless not at all remarkable, little country of\r\n",
      "my own. It's not her country,\" she added, \"that makes a woman happy or\r\n",
      "unhappy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame Clairin, Euphemia's sister-in-law, might meanwhile have been\r\n",
      "supposed to have undertaken the graceful task of making Longmore ashamed\r\n",
      "of his uncivil jottings about her sex and nation. Mademoiselle de\r\n",
      "Mauves, bringing example to the confirmation of precept, had made\r\n",
      "a remunerative match and sacrificed her name to the millions of a\r\n",
      "prosperous and aspiring wholesale druggist--a gentleman liberal enough\r\n",
      "to regard his fortune as a moderate price for being towed into circles\r\n",
      "unpervaded by pharmaceutic odours. His system possibly was sound, but\r\n",
      "his own application of it to be deplored. M. Clairin's head was turned\r\n",
      "by his good luck. Having secured an aristocratic wife he adopted an\r\n",
      "aristocratic vice and began to gamble at the Bourse. In an evil hour he\r\n",
      "lost heavily, and then staked heavily to recover himself. But he was\r\n",
      "to learn that the law of compensation works with no such pleasing\r\n",
      "simplicity, and he rolled to the dark bottom of his folly. There he felt\r\n",
      "everything go--his wits, his courage, his probity, everything that had\r\n",
      "made him what his fatuous marriage had so promptly unmade. He walked up\r\n",
      "the Rue Vivienne with his hands in his empty pockets and stood half an\r\n",
      "hour staring confusedly up and down the brave boulevard. People brushed\r\n",
      "against him and half a dozen carriages almost ran over him, until at\r\n",
      "last a policeman, who had been watching him for some time, took him by\r\n",
      "the arm and led him gently away. He looked at the man's cocked hat and\r\n",
      "sword with tears in his eyes; he hoped for some practical application\r\n",
      "of the wrath of heaven, something that would express violently his\r\n",
      "dead-weight of self-abhorrence. The sergent de ville, however, only\r\n",
      "stationed him in the embrasure of a door, out of harm's way, and walked\r\n",
      "off to supervise a financial contest between an old lady and a cabman.\r\n",
      "Poor M. Clairin had only been married a year, but he had had time to\r\n",
      "measure the great spirit of true children of the anciens preux. When\r\n",
      "night had fallen he repaired to the house of a friend and asked for\r\n",
      "a night's lodging; and as his friend, who was simply his old head\r\n",
      "book-keeper and lived in a small way, was put to some trouble to\r\n",
      "accommodate him, \"You must pardon me,\" the poor man said, \"but I can't\r\n",
      "go home. I'm afraid of my wife!\" Toward morning he blew his brains out.\r\n",
      "His widow turned the remnants of his property to better account than\r\n",
      "could have been expected and wore the very handsomest mourning. It was\r\n",
      "for this latter reason perhaps that she was obliged to retrench at other\r\n",
      "points and accept a temporary home under her brother's roof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortune had played Madame Clairin a terrible trick, but had found an\r\n",
      "adversary and not a victim. Though quite without beauty she had always\r\n",
      "had what is called the grand air, and her air from this time forth was\r\n",
      "grander than ever. As she trailed about in her sable furbelows, tossing\r\n",
      "back her well-dressed head and holding up her vigilant long-handled\r\n",
      "eyeglass, she seemed to be sweeping the whole field of society and\r\n",
      "asking herself where she should pluck her revenge. Suddenly she espied\r\n",
      "it, ready made to her hand, in poor Longmore's wealth and amiability.\r\n",
      "American dollars and American complaisance had made her brother's\r\n",
      "fortune; why shouldn't they make hers? She overestimated the wealth and\r\n",
      "misinterpreted the amiability; for she was sure a man could neither be\r\n",
      "so contented without being rich nor so \"backward\" without being weak.\r\n",
      "Longmore met her advances with a formal politeness that covered a\r\n",
      "good deal of unflattering discomposure. She made him feel deeply\r\n",
      "uncomfortable; and though he was at a loss to conceive how he could be\r\n",
      "an object of interest to a sharp Parisienne he had an indefinable sense\r\n",
      "of being enclosed in a magnetic circle, of having become the victim of\r\n",
      "an incantation. If Madame Clairin could have fathomed his Puritanic soul\r\n",
      "she would have laid by her wand and her book and dismissed him for an\r\n",
      "impossible subject. She gave him a moral chill, and he never named her\r\n",
      "to himself save as that dreadful woman--that awful woman. He did justice\r\n",
      "to her grand air, but for his pleasure he preferred the small air of\r\n",
      "Madame de Mauves; and he never made her his bow, after standing frigidly\r\n",
      "passive for five minutes to one of her gracious overtures to intimacy,\r\n",
      "without feeling a peculiar desire to ramble away into the forest, fling\r\n",
      "himself down on the warm grass and, staring up at the blue sky, forget\r\n",
      "that there were any women in nature who didn't please like the swaying\r\n",
      "tree-tops. One day, on his arrival at the house, she met him in the\r\n",
      "court with the news that her sister-in-law was shut up with a\r\n",
      "headache and that his visit must be for HER. He followed her into the\r\n",
      "drawing-room with the best grace at his command, and sat twirling his\r\n",
      "hat for half an hour. Suddenly he understood her; her caressing cadences\r\n",
      "were so almost explicit an invitation to solicit the charming honour\r\n",
      "of her hand. He blushed to the roots of his hair and jumped up with\r\n",
      "uncontrollable alacrity; then, dropping a glance at Madame Clairin,\r\n",
      "who sat watching him with hard eyes over the thin edge of her smile,\r\n",
      "perceived on her brow a flash of unforgiving wrath. It was not pleasing\r\n",
      "in itself, but his eyes lingered a moment, for it seemed to show off her\r\n",
      "character. What he saw in the picture frightened him and he felt himself\r\n",
      "murmur \"Poor Madame de Mauves!\" His departure was abrupt, and this time\r\n",
      "he really went into the forest and lay down on the grass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After which he admired his young countrywoman more than ever; her\r\n",
      "intrinsic clearness shone out to him even through the darker shade cast\r\n",
      "over it. At the end of a month he received a letter from a friend with\r\n",
      "whom he had arranged a tour through the Low Countries, reminding him\r\n",
      "of his promise to keep their tryst at Brussels. It was only after his\r\n",
      "answer was posted that he fully measured the zeal with which he had\r\n",
      "declared that the journey must either be deferred or abandoned--since he\r\n",
      "couldn't possibly leave Saint-Germain. He took a walk in the forest\r\n",
      "and asked himself if this were indeed portentously true. Such a truth\r\n",
      "somehow made it surely his duty to march straight home and put together\r\n",
      "his effects. Poor Webster, who, he knew, had counted ardently on this\r\n",
      "excursion, was the best of men; six weeks ago he would have gone through\r\n",
      "anything to join poor Webster. It had never been in his books to throw\r\n",
      "overboard a friend whom he had loved ten years for a married woman whom\r\n",
      "he had six weeks--well, admired. It was certainly beyond question that\r\n",
      "he hung on at Saint-Germain because this admirable married woman was\r\n",
      "there; but in the midst of so much admiration what had become of his\r\n",
      "fine old power to conclude? This was the conduct of a man not judging\r\n",
      "but drifting, and he had pretended never to drift. If she were as\r\n",
      "unhappy as he believed the active sympathy of such a man would help her\r\n",
      "very little more than his indifference; if she were less so she needed\r\n",
      "no help and could dispense with his professions. He was sure moreover\r\n",
      "that if she knew he was staying on her account she would be extremely\r\n",
      "annoyed. This very feeling indeed had much to do with making it hard\r\n",
      "to go; her displeasure would be the flush on the snow of the high cold\r\n",
      "stoicism that touched him to the heart. At moments withal he assured\r\n",
      "himself that staying to watch her--and what else did it come to?--was\r\n",
      "simply impertinent; it was gross to keep tugging at the cover of a book\r\n",
      "so intentionally closed. Then inclination answered that some day her\r\n",
      "self-support would fail, and he had a vision of this exquisite creature\r\n",
      "calling vainly for help. He would just be her friend to any length, and\r\n",
      "it was unworthy of either to think about consequences. He was a friend,\r\n",
      "however, who nursed a brooding regret for his not having known her\r\n",
      "five years earlier, as well as a particular objection to those who had\r\n",
      "smartly anticipated him. It seemed one of fortune's most mocking strokes\r\n",
      "that she should be surrounded by persons whose only merit was that they\r\n",

      "him to see any other merit than this in Richard de Mauves. And yet,\r\n",

      "perversity lighted by such a conclusion, and there were times when\r\n",

      "fault if his wife's love of life had pitched itself once for all in\r\n",
      "the minor key. The Count's manners were perfect, his discretion\r\n",
      "irreproachable, and he seemed never to address his companion but,\r\n",
      "sentimentally speaking, hat in hand. His tone to Longmore--as the latter\r\n",
      "was perfectly aware--was that of a man of the world to a man not quite\r\n",
      "of the world; but what it lacked in true frankness it made up in easy\r\n",

      "He couldn't fancy him formed both to neglect his wife and to take the\r\n",

      "friend on account of that very same fine difference of nature which\r\n",
      "so deeply stirred his own sympathies. He was rarely present during the\r\n",
      "sessions of the American visitor, and he made a daily journey to Paris,\r\n",
      "where he had de gros soucis d'affaires as he once mentioned--with an\r\n",
      "all-embracing flourish and not in the least in the tone of apology. When\r\n",
      "he appeared it was late in the evening and with an imperturbable air\r\n",
      "of being on the best of terms with every one and every thing which was\r\n",
      "peculiarly annoying if you happened to have a tacit quarrel with him.\r\n",
      "If he was an honest man he was an honest man somehow spoiled for\r\n",
      "confidence. Something he had, however, that his critic vaguely envied,\r\n",
      "something in his address, splendidly positive, a manner rounded\r\n",
      "and polished by the habit of conversation and the friction of full\r\n",
      "experience, an urbanity exercised for his own sake, not for his\r\n",
      "neighbour's, which seemed the fruit of one of those strong temperaments\r\n",
      "that rule the inward scene better than the best conscience. The Count\r\n",
      "had plainly no sense for morals, and poor Longmore, who had the finest,\r\n",
      "would have been glad to borrow his recipe for appearing then so to range\r\n",
      "the whole scale of the senses. What was it that enabled him, short of\r\n",
      "being a monster with visibly cloven feet and exhaling brimstone, to\r\n",
      "misprize so cruelly a nature like his wife's and to walk about the world\r\n",
      "with such a handsome invincible grin? It was the essential grossness of\r\n",
      "his imagination, which had nevertheless helped him to such a store of\r\n",
      "neat speeches. He could be highly polite and could doubtless be damnably\r\n",
      "impertinent, but the life of the spirit was a world as closed to him as\r\n",
      "the world of great music to a man without an ear. It was ten to one\r\n",
      "he didn't in the least understand how his wife felt; he and his smooth\r\n",
      "sister had doubtless agreed to regard their relative as a Puritanical\r\n",
      "little person, of meagre aspirations and few talents, content with\r\n",
      "looking at Paris from the terrace and, as a special treat, having a\r\n",
      "countryman very much like herself to regale her with innocent echoes\r\n",
      "of their native wit. M. de Mauves was tired of his companion; he\r\n",
      "liked women who could, frankly, amuse him better. She was too dim, too\r\n",
      "delicate, too modest; she had too few arts, too little coquetry,\r\n",
      "too much charity. Lighting a cigar some day while he summed up his\r\n",
      "situation, her husband had probably decided she was incurably stupid.\r\n",
      "It was the same taste, in essence, our young man moralised, as the taste\r\n",
      "for M. Gerome and M. Baudry in painting and for M. Gustave Flaubert and\r\n",
      "M. Charles Baudelaire in literature. The Count was a pagan and his wife\r\n",
      "a Christian, and between them an impassable gulf. He was by race and\r\n",
      "instinct a grand seigneur. Longmore had often heard of that historic\r\n",
      "type, and was properly grateful for an opportunity to examine it\r\n",
      "closely. It had its elegance of outline, but depended on spiritual\r\n",
      "sources so remote from those of which he felt the living gush in his own\r\n",
      "soul that he found himself gazing at it, in irreconcileable antipathy,\r\n",
      "through a dim historic mist. \"I'm a modern bourgeois,\" he said, \"and\r\n",

      "supper before the mirrors properly crack to hear. But I've not met\r\n",
      "one of the rarest of women without recognising her, without making\r\n",

      "'fetching' even than the worst of Theresa's songs sung by a dissipated\r\n",
      "duchess. Wit for wit, I think mine carries me further.\" It was easy\r\n",
      "indeed to perceive that, as became a grand seigneur, M. de Mauves had a\r\n",
      "stock of social principles. He wouldn't especially have desired perhaps\r\n",
      "that his wife should compete in amateur operettas with the duchesses in\r\n",
      "question, for the most part of comparatively recent origin; but he held\r\n",
      "that a gentleman may take his amusement where he finds it, that he\r\n",
      "is quite at liberty not to find it at home, and that even an adoptive\r\n",
      "daughter of his house who should hang her head and have red eyes and\r\n",
      "allow herself to make any other response to officious condolence than\r\n",
      "that her husband's amusements were his own affair, would have forfeited\r\n",
      "every claim to having her finger-tips bowed over and kissed. And yet in\r\n",
      "spite of this definite faith Longmore figured him much inconvenienced\r\n",
      "by the Countess's avoidance of betrayals. Did it dimly occur to him that\r\n",
      "the principle of this reserve was self-control and not self-effacement?\r\n",
      "She was a model to all the inferior matrons of his line, past and to\r\n",
      "come, and an occasional \"scene\" from her at a manageable hour would\r\n",
      "have had something reassuring--would have attested her stupidity rather\r\n",
      "better than this mere polish of her patience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore would have given much to be able to guess how this latter\r\n",
      "secret worked, and he tried more than once, though timidly and awkwardly\r\n",
      "enough, to make out the game she was playing. She struck him as having\r\n",
      "long resisted the force of cruel evidence, and, as though succumbing to\r\n",
      "it at last, having denied herself on simple grounds of generosity the\r\n",
      "right to complain. Her faith might have perished, but the sense of her\r\n",
      "own old deep perversity remained. He believed her thus quite capable\r\n",
      "of reproaching herself with having expected too much and of trying to\r\n",
      "persuade herself out of her bitterness by saying that her hopes had been\r\n",
      "vanities and follies and that what was before her was simply Life. \"I\r\n",
      "hate tragedy,\" she once said to him; \"I'm a dreadful coward about having\r\n",
      "to suffer or to bleed. I've always tried to believe that--without\r\n",
      "base concessions--such extremities may always somehow be dodged or\r\n",
      "indefinitely postponed. I should be willing to buy myself off, from\r\n",
      "having ever to be OVERWHELMED, by giving up--well, any amusement you\r\n",
      "like.\" She lived evidently in nervous apprehension of being fatally\r\n",
      "convinced--of seeing to the end of her deception. Longmore, when he\r\n",
      "thought of this, felt the force of his desire to offer her something of\r\n",

      "mankind I'm sure I should be pronounced a very fortunate woman.\" There\r\n",
      "was something that deeply touched him in her tone, and this quality\r\n",
      "pierced further as she continued. \"But let me add, with all gratitude\r\n",
      "for your sympathy, that it's my own affair altogether. It needn't\r\n",

      "simply that he was in love. He looked at the rooks wheeling against the\r\n",
      "golden-hued sky, between the tree-tops, but not at his companion, whose\r\n",
      "personal presence seemed lost in the felicity she had created. Madame de\r\n",
      "Mauves was silent and grave--she felt she had almost grossly failed and\r\n",
      "she was proportionately disappointed. An emotional friendship she had\r\n",
      "not desired; her scheme had been to pass with her visitor as a placid\r\n",
      "creature with a good deal of leisure which she was disposed to devote to\r\n",
      "profitable conversation of an impersonal sort. She liked him extremely,\r\n",
      "she felt in him the living force of something to which, when she made up\r\n",
      "her girlish mind that a needy nobleman was the ripest fruit of time,\r\n",
      "she had done too scant justice. They went through the little gate in the\r\n",
      "garden-wall and approached the house. On the terrace Madame Clairin was\r\n",
      "entertaining a friend--a little elderly gentleman with a white moustache\r\n",
      "and an order in his buttonhole. Madame de Mauves chose to pass round\r\n",
      "the house into the court; whereupon her sister-in-law, greeting Longmore\r\n",
      "with an authoritative nod, lifted her eye-glass and stared at them as\r\n",
      "they went by. Longmore heard the little old gentleman uttering some\r\n",
      "old-fashioned epigram about \"la vieille galanterie francaise\"--then by\r\n",
      "a sudden impulse he looked at Madame de Mauves and wondered what she was\r\n",
      "doing in such a world. She stopped before the house, not asking him to\r\n",
      "come in. \"I hope you will act on my advice and waste no more time at\r\n",
      "Saint-Germain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For an instant there rose to his lips some faded compliment about his\r\n",
      "time not being wasted, but it expired before the simple sincerity of\r\n",
      "her look. She stood there as gently serious as the angel of\r\n",
      "disinterestedness, and it seemed to him he should insult her by treating\r\n",
      "her words as a bait for flattery. \"I shall start in a day or two,\" he\r\n",
      "answered, \"but I won't promise you not to come back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hope not,\" she said simply. \"I expect to be here a long time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall come and say good-bye,\" he returned--which she appeared to\r\n",
      "accept with a smile as she went in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood a moment, then walked slowly homeward by the terrace. It seemed\r\n",
      "to him that to leave her thus, for a gain on which she herself insisted,\r\n",
      "was to know her better and admire her more. But he was aware of a vague\r\n",
      "ferment of feeling which her evasion of his question half an hour before\r\n",
      "had done more to deepen than to allay. In the midst of it suddenly, on\r\n",
      "the great terrace of the Chateau, he encountered M. de Mauves, planted\r\n",
      "there against the parapet and finishing a cigar. The Count, who, he\r\n",
      "thought he made out, had an air of peculiar affability, offered him his\r\n",
      "white plump hand. Longmore stopped; he felt a sharp, a sore desire to\r\n",
      "cry out to him that he had the most precious wife in the world, that\r\n",
      "he ought to be ashamed of himself not to know it, and that for all his\r\n",
      "grand assurance he had never looked down into the depths of her eyes.\r\n",
      "Richard de Mauves, we have seen, considered he had; but there was\r\n",
      "doubtless now something in this young woman's eyes that had not been\r\n",
      "there five years before. The two men conversed formally enough, and\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves threw off a light bright remark or two about his visit to\r\n",
      "America. His tone was not soothing to Longmore's excited sensibilities.\r\n",
      "He seemed to have found the country a gigantic joke, and his blandness\r\n",
      "went but so far as to allow that jokes on that scale are indeed\r\n",
      "inexhaustible. Longmore was not by habit an aggressive apologist for the\r\n",
      "seat of his origin, but the Count's easy diagnosis confirmed his worst\r\n",
      "estimate of French superficiality. He had understood nothing, felt\r\n",
      "nothing, learned nothing, and his critic, glancing askance at his\r\n",
      "aristocratic profile, declared that if the chief merit of a long\r\n",
      "pedigree was to leave one so fatuously stupid he thanked goodness the\r\n",
      "Longmores had emerged from obscurity in the present century and in the\r\n",
      "person of an enterprising timber-merchant. M. de Mauves dwelt of course\r\n",
      "on that prime oddity of the American order--the liberty allowed the\r\n",
      "fairer half of the unmarried young, and confessed to some personal study\r\n",
      "of the \"occasions\" it offered to the speculative visitor; a line of\r\n",
      "research in which, during a fortnight's stay, he had clearly spent his\r\n",
      "most agreeable hours. \"I'm bound to admit,\" he said, \"that in every case\r\n",
      "I was disarmed by the extreme candour of the young lady, and that they\r\n",
      "took care of themselves to better purpose than I have seen some mammas\r\n",
      "in France take care of them.\" Longmore greeted this handsome concession\r\n",
      "with the grimmest of smiles and damned his impertinent patronage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mentioning, however, at last that he was about to leave Saint-Germain,\r\n",
      "he was surprised, without exactly being flattered, by his interlocutor's\r\n",
      "quickened attention. \"I'm so very sorry; I hoped we had you for the\r\n",
      "whole summer.\" Longmore murmured something civil and wondered why M.\r\n",
      "de Mauves should care whether he stayed or went. \"You've been a real\r\n",
      "resource to Madame de Mauves,\" the Count added; \"I assure you I've\r\n",
      "mentally blessed your visits.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They were a great pleasure to me,\" Longmore said gravely. \"Some day I\r\n",
      "expect to come back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pray do\"--and the Count made a great and friendly point of it. \"You see\r\n",
      "the confidence I have in you.\" Longmore said nothing and M. de Mauves\r\n",
      "puffed his cigar reflectively and watched the smoke. \"Madame de Mauves,\"\r\n",
      "he said at last, \"is a rather singular person.\" And then while our young\r\n",
      "man shifted his position and wondered whether he was going to \"explain\"\r\n",
      "Madame de Mauves, \"Being, as you are, her fellow countryman,\" this\r\n",
      "lady's husband pursued, \"I don't mind speaking frankly. She's a little\r\n",
      "overstrained; the most charming woman in the world, as you see, but\r\n",
      "a little volontaire and morbid. Now you see she has taken this\r\n",
      "extraordinary fancy for solitude. I can't get her to go anywhere, to see\r\n",
      "any one. When my friends present themselves she's perfectly polite, but\r\n",
      "it cures them of coming again. She doesn't do herself justice, and I\r\n",
      "expect every day to hear two or three of them say to me, 'Your wife's\r\n",
      "jolie a croquer: what a pity she hasn't a little esprit.' You must\r\n",
      "have found out that she has really a great deal. But, to tell the whole\r\n",
      "truth, what she needs is to forget herself. She sits alone for hours\r\n",
      "poring over her English books and looking at life through that terrible\r\n",
      "brown fog they seem to me--don't they?--to fling over the world. I\r\n",
      "doubt if your English authors,\" the Count went on with a serenity which\r\n",
      "Longmore afterwards characterised as sublime, \"are very sound reading\r\n",
      "for young married women. I don't pretend to know much about them; but I\r\n",
      "remember that not long after our marriage Madame de Mauves undertook to\r\n",

      "very much the same taste in literature as in cookery. But you're a man\r\n",
      "of general culture, a man of the world,\" said M. de Mauves, turning to\r\n",

      "M. de Mauves made a series of short nervous jerks with his stick in the\r\n",
      "air--\"it would wake up her imagination. She's too much of one piece,\r\n",
      "you know--it would show her how much one may bend without breaking.\" He\r\n",
      "paused a moment and gave two or three vigorous puffs. Then turning\r\n",
      "to his companion again with eyebrows expressively raised: \"I hope you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Evening was at hand and the lingering light seemed to charge the air\r\n",
      "with faintly golden motes. Longmore stood gazing at these luminous\r\n",
      "particles; he could almost have fancied them a swarm of humming insects,\r\n",
      "the chorus of a refrain: \"She has a great deal of esprit--she has\r\n",
      "a great deal of esprit.\" \"Yes,--she has a great deal,\" he said\r\n",
      "mechanically, turning to the Count. M. de Mauves glanced at him sharply,\r\n",
      "as if to ask what the deuce he was talking about. \"She has a great deal\r\n",
      "of intelligence,\" said Longmore quietly, \"a great deal of beauty, a\r\n",
      "great many virtues.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves busied himself for a moment in lighting another cigar,\r\n",
      "and when he had finished, with a return of his confidential smile,\r\n",
      "\"I suspect you of thinking that I don't do my wife justice.\" he made\r\n",
      "answer. \"Take care--take care, young man; that's a dangerous assumption.\r\n",
      "In general a man always does his wife justice. More than justice,\" the\r\n",
      "Count laughed--\"that we keep for the wives of other men!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore afterwards remembered in favour of his friend's fine manner\r\n",
      "that he had not measured at this moment the dusky abyss over which\r\n",
      "it hovered. Hut a deepening subterranean echo, loudest at the last,\r\n",
      "lingered on his spiritual ear. For the present his keenest sensation was\r\n",
      "a desire to get away and cry aloud that M. de Mauves was no better than\r\n",
      "a pompous dunce. He bade him an abrupt good-night, which was to serve\r\n",
      "also, he said, as good-bye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Decidedly then you go?\" It was spoken almost with the note of\r\n",
      "irritation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Decidedly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But of course you'll come and take leave--?\" His manner implied that\r\n",
      "the omission would be uncivil, but there seemed to Longmore himself\r\n",
      "something so ludicrous in his taking a lesson in consideration from M.\r\n",
      "de Mauves that he put the appeal by with a laugh. The Count frowned as\r\n",
      "if it were a new and unpleasant sensation for him to be left at a loss.\r\n",
      "\"Ah you people have your facons!\" he murmured as Longmore turned away,\r\n",
      "not foreseeing that he should learn still more about his facons before\r\n",
      "he had done with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore sat down to dinner at his hotel with his usual good intentions,\r\n",
      "but in the act of lifting his first glass of wine to his lips he\r\n",
      "suddenly fell to musing and set down the liquor untasted. This mood\r\n",
      "lasted long, and when he emerged from it his fish was cold; but that\r\n",
      "mattered little, for his appetite was gone. That evening he packed his\r\n",
      "trunk with an indignant energy. This was so effective that the operation\r\n",
      "was accomplished before bedtime, and as he was not in the least sleepy\r\n",
      "he devoted the interval to writing two letters, one of them a short note\r\n",
      "to Madame de Mauves, which he entrusted to a servant for delivery the\r\n",
      "next morning. He had found it best, he said, to leave Saint-Germain\r\n",
      "immediately, but he expected to return to Paris early in the autumn. The\r\n",
      "other letter was the result of his having remembered a day or two before\r\n",
      "that he had not yet complied with Mrs. Draper's injunction to give her\r\n",
      "an account of his impression of her friend. The present occasion seemed\r\n",
      "propitious, and he wrote half a dozen pages. His tone, however,\r\n",
      "was grave, and Mrs. Draper, on reading him over, was slightly\r\n",
      "disappointed--she would have preferred he should have \"raved\" a little\r\n",
      "more. But what chiefly concerns us is the concluding passage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The only time she ever spoke to me of her marriage,\" he wrote, \"she\r\n",
      "intimated that it had been a perfect love-match. With all abatements, I\r\n",
      "suppose, this is what most marriages take themselves to be; but it would\r\n",
      "mean in her case, I think, more than in that of most women, for her love\r\n",
      "was an absolute idealisation. She believed her husband to be a hero of\r\n",
      "rose-coloured romance, and he turns out to be not even a hero of very\r\n",
      "sad-coloured reality. For some time now she has been sounding her\r\n",
      "mistake, but I don't believe she has yet touched the bottom. She strikes\r\n",
      "me as a person who's begging off from full knowledge--who has patched up\r\n",
      "a peace with some painful truth and is trying a while the experiment of\r\n",
      "living with closed eyes. In the dark she tries to see again the gilding\r\n",
      "on her idol. Illusion of course is illusion, and one must always pay for\r\n",
      "it; but there's something truly tragical in seeing an earthly penalty\r\n",
      "levied on such divine folly as this. As for M. de Mauves he's a shallow\r\n",
      "Frenchman to his fingers' ends, and I confess I should dislike him for\r\n",
      "this if he were a much better man. He can't forgive his wife for having\r\n",
      "married him too extravagantly and loved him too well; since he feels, I\r\n",
      "suppose, in some uncorrupted corner of his being that as she originally\r\n",
      "saw him so he ought to have been. It disagrees with him somewhere that\r\n",
      "a little American bourgeoise should have fancied him a finer fellow\r\n",
      "than he is or than he at all wants to be. He hasn't a glimmering of real\r\n",
      "acquaintance with his wife; he can't understand the stream of passion\r\n",
      "flowing so clear and still. To tell the truth I hardly understand it\r\n",
      "myself, but when I see the sight I find I greatly admire it. The Count\r\n",
      "at any rate would have enjoyed the comfort of believing his wife as bad\r\n",
      "a case as himself, and you'll hardly believe me when I assure you he\r\n",
      "goes about intimating to gentlemen whom he thinks it may concern that\r\n",

      "On reaching Paris Longmore straightaway purchased a Murray's \"Belgium\"\r\n",
      "to help himself to believe that he would start on the morrow for\r\n",
      "Brussels; but when the morrow came it occurred to him that he ought by\r\n",
      "way of preparation to acquaint himself more intimately with the Flemish\r\n",
      "painters in the Louvre. This took a whole morning, but it did little\r\n",
      "to hasten his departure. He had abruptly left Saint-Germain because\r\n",
      "it seemed to him that respect for Madame de Mauves required he should\r\n",
      "bequeath her husband no reason to suppose he had, as it were, taken a\r\n",
      "low hint; but now that he had deferred to that scruple he found himself\r\n",
      "thinking more and more ardently of his friend. It was a poor expression\r\n",
      "of ardour to be lingering irresolutely on the forsaken boulevard, but\r\n",
      "he detested the idea of leaving Saint-Germain five hundred miles behind\r\n",
      "him. He felt very foolish, nevertheless, and wandered about nervously,\r\n",
      "promising himself to take the next train. A dozen trains started,\r\n",
      "however, and he was still in Paris. This inward ache was more than he\r\n",
      "had bargained for, and as he looked at the shop-windows he wondered if\r\n",
      "it represented a \"passion.\" He had never been fond of the word and had\r\n",
      "grown up with much mistrust of what it stood for. He had hoped that\r\n",
      "when he should fall \"really\" in love he should do it with an excellent\r\n",
      "conscience, with plenty of confidence and joy, doubtless, but no strange\r\n",
      "soreness, no pangs nor regrets. Here was a sentiment concocted of pity\r\n",
      "and anger as well as of admiration, and bristling with scruples and\r\n",
      "doubts and fears. He had come abroad to enjoy the Flemish painters and\r\n",
      "all others, but what fair-tressed saint of Van Eyck or Memling was so\r\n",
      "interesting a figure as the lonely lady of Saint-Germain? His restless\r\n",
      "steps carried him at last out of the long villa-bordered avenue which\r\n",
      "leads to the Bois de Boulogne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Summer had fairly begun and the drive beside the lake was empty, but\r\n",
      "there were various loungers on the benches and chairs, and the great\r\n",
      "cafe had an air of animation. Longmore's walk had given him an appetite,\r\n",
      "and he went into the establishment and demanded a dinner, remarking for\r\n",
      "the hundredth time, as he admired the smart little tables disposed in\r\n",
      "the open air, how much better (than anywhere else) they ordered this\r\n",
      "matter in France. \"Will monsieur dine in the garden or in the salon?\"\r\n",
      "the waiter blandly asked. Longmore chose the garden and, observing that\r\n",
      "a great cluster of June roses was trained over the wall of the house,\r\n",
      "placed himself at a table near by, where the best of dinners was served\r\n",
      "him on the whitest of linen and in the most shining of porcelain. It so\r\n",
      "happened that his table was near a window and that as he sat he could\r\n",
      "look into a corner of the salon. So it was that his attention rested\r\n",
      "on a lady seated just within the window, which was open, face to face\r\n",
      "apparently with a companion who was concealed by the curtain. She was a\r\n",
      "very pretty woman, and Longmore looked at her as often as was consistent\r\n",
      "with good manners. After a while he even began to wonder who she was and\r\n",
      "finally to suspect that she was one of those ladies whom it is no breach\r\n",
      "of good manners to look at as often as you like. Our young man too, if\r\n",
      "he had been so disposed, would have been the more free to give her all\r\n",
      "his attention that her own was fixed upon the person facing her. She was\r\n",
      "what the French call a belle brune, and though Longmore, who had rather\r\n",
      "a conservative taste in such matters, was but half-charmed by her bold\r\n",
      "outlines and even braver complexion, he couldn't help admiring her\r\n",
      "expression of basking contentment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was evidently very happy, and her happiness gave her an air of\r\n",
      "innocence. The talk of her friend, whoever he was, abundantly suited\r\n",
      "her humour, for she sat listening to him with a broad idle smile and\r\n",
      "interrupting him fitfully, while she crunched her bonbons, with a\r\n",
      "murmured response, presumably as broad, which appeared to have the\r\n",
      "effect of launching him again. She drank a great deal of champagne and\r\n",
      "ate an immense number of strawberries, and was plainly altogether a\r\n",
      "person with an impartial relish for strawberries, champagne and what she\r\n",
      "doubtless would have called betises.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had half-finished dinner when Longmore sat down, and he was still\r\n",
      "in his place when they rose. She had hung her bonnet on a nail above her\r\n",
      "chair, and her companion passed round the table to take it down for her.\r\n",
      "As he did so she bent her head to look at a wine-stain on her dress, and\r\n",
      "in the movement exposed the greater part of the back of a very handsome\r\n",
      "neck. The gentleman observed it, and observed also, apparently, that the\r\n",
      "room beyond them was empty; that he stood within eyeshot of Longmore he\r\n",
      "failed to observe. He stooped suddenly and imprinted a gallant kiss on\r\n",
      "the fair expanse. In the author of this tribute Longmore then recognised\r\n",
      "Richard de Mauves. The lady to whom it had been rendered put on her\r\n",
      "bonnet, using his flushed smile as a mirror, and in a moment they passed\r\n",
      "through the garden on their way to their carriage. Then for the first\r\n",
      "time M. de Mauves became aware of his wife's young friend. He measured\r\n",
      "with a rapid glance this spectator's relation to the open window and\r\n",
      "checked himself in the impulse to stop and speak to him. He contented\r\n",
      "himself with bowing all imperturbably as he opened the gate for his\r\n",
      "companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That evening Longmore made a railway journey, but not to Brussels. He\r\n",
      "had effectually ceased to care for Brussels; all he cared for in the\r\n",
      "world now was Madame de Mauves. The air of his mind had had a sudden\r\n",
      "clearing-up; pity and anger were still throbbing there, but they had\r\n",
      "space to range at their pleasure, for doubts and scruples had abruptly\r\n",
      "departed. It was little, he felt, that he could interpose between her\r\n",
      "resignation and the indignity of her position; but that little, if it\r\n",
      "involved the sacrifice of everything that bound him to the tranquil\r\n",
      "past, he could offer her with a rapture which at last made stiff\r\n",
      "resistance a terribly inferior substitute for faith. Nothing in his\r\n",
      "tranquil past had given such a zest to consciousness as this happy sense\r\n",
      "of choosing to go straight back to Saint-Germain. How to justify his\r\n",
      "return, how to explain his ardour, troubled him little. He wasn't even\r\n",
      "sure he wished to be understood; he wished only to show how little by\r\n",
      "any fault of his Madame de Mauves was alone so with the harshness of\r\n",
      "fate. He was conscious of no distinct desire to \"make love\" to her; if\r\n",
      "he could have uttered the essence of his longing he would have said that\r\n",
      "he wished her to remember that in a world coloured grey to her vision\r\n",
      "by the sense of her mistake there was one vividly honest man. She might\r\n",
      "certainly have remembered it, however, without his coming back to remind\r\n",
      "her; and it is not to be denied that as he waited for the morrow he\r\n",
      "longed immensely for the sound of her voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waited the next day till his usual hour of calling--the late\r\n",
      "afternoon; but he learned at the door that the mistress of the house was\r\n",
      "not at home. The servant offered the information that she was walking\r\n",
      "a little way in the forest. Longmore went through the garden and out\r\n",
      "of the small door into the lane, and, after half an hour's vain\r\n",
      "exploration, saw her coming toward him at the end of a green by-path. As\r\n",
      "he appeared she stopped a moment, as if to turn aside; then recognising\r\n",
      "him she slowly advanced and had presently taken the hand he held out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing has happened,\" she said with her beautiful eyes on him. \"You're\r\n",
      "not ill?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing except that when I got to Paris I found how fond I had grown of\r\n",
      "Saint-Germain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She neither smiled nor looked flattered; it seemed indeed to Longmore\r\n",
      "that she took his reappearance with no pleasure. But he was uncertain,\r\n",
      "for he immediately noted that in his absence the whole character of her\r\n",
      "face had changed. It showed him something momentous had happened. It was\r\n",
      "no longer self-contained melancholy that he read in her eyes, but grief\r\n",
      "and agitation which had lately struggled with the passionate love of\r\n",
      "peace ruling her before all things else, and forced her to know that\r\n",
      "deep experience is never peaceful. She was pale and had evidently been\r\n",
      "shedding tears. He felt his heart beat hard--he seemed now to touch\r\n",
      "her secret. She continued to look at him with a clouded brow, as if his\r\n",
      "return had surrounded her with complications too great to be disguised\r\n",
      "by a colourless welcome. For some moments, as he turned and walked\r\n",
      "beside her, neither spoke; then abruptly, \"Tell me truly, Mr. Longmore,\"\r\n",
      "she said, \"why you've come back.\" He inclined himself to her, almost\r\n",
      "pulling up again, with an air that startled her into a certainty of what\r\n",
      "she had feared. \"Because I've learned the real answer to the question I\r\n",
      "asked you the other day. You're not happy--you're too good to be happy\r\n",
      "on the terms offered you. Madame de Mauves,\" he went on with a gesture\r\n",
      "which protested against a gesture of her own, \"I can't be happy, you\r\n",
      "know, when you're as little so as I make you out. I don't care for\r\n",
      "anything so long as I only feel helpless and sore about you. I found\r\n",
      "during those dreary days in Paris that the thing in life I most care for\r\n",
      "is this daily privilege of seeing you. I know it's very brutal to tell\r\n",
      "you I admire you; it's an insult to you to treat you as if you had\r\n",
      "complained to me or appealed to me. But such a friendship as I waked up\r\n",
      "to there\"--and he tossed his head toward the distant city--\"is a potent\r\n",
      "force, I assure you. When forces are stupidly stifled they explode.\r\n",
      "However,\" he went on, \"if you had told me every trouble in your heart it\r\n",
      "would have mattered little; I couldn't say more than I--that if that\r\n",
      "in life from which you've hoped most has given you least, this devoted\r\n",
      "respect of mine will refuse no service and betray no trust.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had begun to make marks in the earth with the point of her parasol,\r\n",
      "but she stopped and listened to him in perfect immobility--immobility\r\n",
      "save for the appearance by the time he had stopped speaking of a flush\r\n",
      "in her guarded clearness. Such as it was it told Longmore she was moved,\r\n",
      "and his first perceiving it was the happiest moment of his life. She\r\n",
      "raised her eyes at last, and they uttered a plea for non-insistence that\r\n",
      "unspeakably touched him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you--thank you!\" she said calmly enough; but the next moment\r\n",
      "her own emotion baffled this pretence, a convulsion shook her for ten\r\n",
      "seconds and she burst into tears. Her tears vanished as quickly as\r\n",
      "they came, but they did Longmore a world of good. He had always felt\r\n",
      "indefinably afraid of her; her being had somehow seemed fed by a deeper\r\n",
      "faith and a stronger will than his own; but her half-dozen smothered\r\n",
      "sobs showed him the bottom of her heart and convinced him she was weak\r\n",
      "enough to be grateful. \"Excuse me,\" she said; \"I'm too nervous to listen\r\n",
      "to you. I believe I could have dealt with an enemy to-day, but I can't\r\n",
      "bear up under a friend.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're killing yourself with stoicism--that's what is the matter with\r\n",
      "you!\" he cried. \"Listen to a friend for his own sake if not for yours.\r\n",
      "I've never presumed to offer you an atom of compassion, and you can't\r\n",
      "accuse yourself of an abuse of charity.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked about her as under the constraint of this appeal, but it\r\n",
      "promised him a reluctant attention. Noting, however, by the wayside the\r\n",
      "fallen log on which they had rested a few evenings before, she went and\r\n",
      "sat down on it with a resigned grace while the young man, silent before\r\n",
      "her and watching her, took from her the mute assurance that if she was\r\n",
      "charitable now he must at least be very wise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Something came to my knowledge yesterday,\" he said as he sat down\r\n",
      "beside her, \"which gave me an intense impression of your loneliness.\r\n",
      "You're truth itself, and there's no truth about you. You believe in\r\n",
      "purity and duty and dignity, and you live in a world in which they're\r\n",
      "daily belied. I ask myself with vain rage how you ever came into such a\r\n",
      "world, and why the perversity of fate never let me know you before.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "poor creatures. I suppose I'm too romantic and always was. I've an\r\n",

      "of passionate faith. It led me to take a great step, and it lies\r\n",
      "behind me now, far off, a vague deceptive form melting in the light of\r\n",
      "experience. It has faded, but it hasn't vanished. Some feelings, I'm\r\n",
      "sure, die only with ourselves; some illusions are as much the condition\r\n",

      "miserably human. As for my loneliness, it doesn't greatly matter; it is\r\n",

      "At first I expended a great deal of sorrow and dismay and pity on it\r\n",

      "scrambling to outdo each other, you'd agree with me that tempers\r\n",

      "compensations. A year ago, while I was in the country, a friend of mine\r\n",
      "was in despair at the infidelity of her husband; she wrote me a most\r\n",
      "dolorous letter, and on my return to Paris I went immediately to see\r\n",
      "her. A week had elapsed, and as I had seen stranger things I thought\r\n",
      "she might have recovered her spirits. Not at all; she was still in\r\n",
      "despair--but at what? At the conduct, the abandoned, shameless conduct\r\n",
      "of--well of a lady I'll call Madame de T. You'll imagine of course that\r\n",
      "Madame de T. was the lady whom my friend's husband preferred to his\r\n",
      "wife. Far from it; he had never seen her. Who then was Madame de T.?\r\n",
      "Madame de T. was cruelly devoted to M. de V. And who was M. de V.? M.\r\n",

      "rate that she found unpardonable, for she quite gave me up. Shortly\r\n",
      "afterwards my husband proposed we should cease to live in Paris, and I\r\n",
      "gladly assented, for I believe I had taken a turn of spirits that made\r\n",
      "me a detestable companion. I should have preferred to go quite into the\r\n",
      "country, into Auvergne, where my husband has a house. But to him Paris\r\n",
      "in some degree is necessary, and Saint-Germain has been a conscious\r\n",
      "compromise.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A conscious compromise!\" Longmore expressively repeated. \"That's your\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It's the life of many people,\" she made prompt answer--\"of most people\r\n",
      "of quiet tastes, and it's certainly better than acute distress. One's\r\n",
      "at a loss theoretically to defend compromises; but if I found a poor\r\n",
      "creature who had managed to arrive at one I should think myself not\r\n",
      "urgently called to expose its weak side.\" But she had no sooner uttered\r\n",
      "these words than she laughed all amicably, as if to mitigate their too\r\n",
      "personal application.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heaven forbid one should do that unless one has something better to\r\n",
      "offer,\" Longmore returned. \"And yet I'm haunted by the dream of a life\r\n",
      "in which you should have found no compromises, for they're a perversion\r\n",
      "of natures that tend only to goodness and rectitude. As I see it you\r\n",
      "should have found happiness serene, profound, complete; a femme de\r\n",
      "chambre not a jewel perhaps, but warranted to tell but one fib a day; a\r\n",
      "society possibly rather provincial, but--in spite of your poor opinion\r\n",
      "of mankind--a good deal of solid virtue; jealousies and vanities very\r\n",
      "tame, and no particular iniquities and adulteries. A husband,\" he added\r\n",
      "after a moment--\"a husband of your own faith and race and spiritual\r\n",
      "substance, who would have loved you well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She rose to her feet, shaking her head. \"You're very kind to go to the\r\n",

      "must make the best of the reality we happen to be in for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Longmore, provoked by what seemed the very wantonness of\r\n",
      "her patience, \"the reality YOU 'happen to be in for' has, if I'm not in\r\n",
      "error, very recently taken a shape that keenly tests your philosophy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She seemed on the point of replying that his sympathy was too zealous;\r\n",
      "but a couple of impatient tears in his eyes proved it founded on a\r\n",
      "devotion of which she mightn't make light. \"Ah philosophy?\" she echoed.\r\n",
      "\"I HAVE none. Thank heaven,\" she cried with vehemence, \"I have none!\r\n",
      "I believe, Mr. Longmore,\" she added in a moment, \"that I've nothing on\r\n",
      "earth but a conscience--it's a good time to tell you so--nothing but a\r\n",
      "dogged obstinate clinging conscience. Does that prove me to be indeed of\r\n",
      "your faith and race, and have you one yourself for which you can say as\r\n",
      "much? I don't speak in vanity, for I believe that if my conscience may\r\n",
      "prevent me from doing anything very base it will effectually prevent me\r\n",
      "also from doing anything very fine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm delighted to hear it,\" her friend returned with high\r\n",
      "emphasis--\"that proves we're made for each other. It's very certain I\r\n",
      "too shall never cut a great romantic figure. And yet I've fancied that\r\n",
      "in my case the unaccommodating organ we speak of might be blinded and\r\n",
      "gagged a while, in a really good cause, if not turned out of doors.\r\n",
      "In yours,\" he went on with the same appealing irony, \"is it absolutely\r\n",
      "beyond being 'squared'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she made no concession to his tone. \"Don't laugh at your\r\n",
      "conscience,\" she answered gravely; \"that's the only blasphemy I know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had hardly spoken when she turned suddenly at an unexpected sound,\r\n",
      "and at the same moment he heard a footstep in an adjacent by-path which\r\n",
      "crossed their own at a short distance from where they stood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's M. de Mauves,\" she said at once; with which she moved slowly\r\n",
      "forward. Longmore, wondering how she knew without seeing, had overtaken\r\n",
      "her by the time her husband came into view. A solitary walk in the\r\n",
      "forest was a pastime to which M. de Mauves was not addicted, but he\r\n",
      "seemed on this occasion to have resorted to it with some equanimity. He\r\n",
      "was smoking a fragrant cigar and had thrust his thumb into the armhole\r\n",
      "of his waistcoat with the air of a man thinking at his ease. He stopped\r\n",
      "short with surprise on seeing his wife and her companion, and his\r\n",
      "surprise had for Longmore even the pitch of impertinence. He glanced\r\n",
      "rapidly from one to the other, fixed the young man's own look sharply a\r\n",
      "single instant and then lifted his hat with formal politeness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was not aware,\" he said, turning to Madame de Mauves, \"that I might\r\n",
      "congratulate you on the return of monsieur.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You should at once have known it,\" she immediately answered, \"if I had\r\n",
      "expected such a pleasure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had turned very pale, and Longmore felt this to be a first meeting\r\n",
      "after some commotion. \"My return was unexpected to myself,\" he said to\r\n",
      "her husband. \"I came back last night.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves seemed to express such satisfaction as could consort with\r\n",
      "a limited interest. \"It's needless for me to make you welcome. Madame\r\n",
      "de Mauves knows the duties of hospitality.\" And with another bow he\r\n",
      "continued his walk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She pursued her homeward course with her friend, neither of them\r\n",
      "pretending much not to consent to appear silent. The Count's few moments\r\n",
      "with them had both chilled Longmore and angered him, casting a shadow\r\n",
      "across a prospect which had somehow, just before, begun to open and\r\n",
      "almost to brighten. He watched his companion narrowly as they went, and\r\n",
      "wondered what she had last had to suffer. Her husband's presence\r\n",
      "had checked her disposition to talk, though nothing betrayed she had\r\n",
      "recognised his making a point at her expense. Yet if matters were none\r\n",
      "the less plainly at a crisis between them he could but wonder vainly\r\n",
      "what it was on her part that prevented some practical protest or some\r\n",
      "rupture. What did she suspect?--how much did she know? To what was she\r\n",
      "resigned?--how much had she forgiven? How, above all, did she reconcile\r\n",
      "with knowledge, or with suspicion, that intense consideration she had\r\n",
      "just now all but assured him she entertained? \"She has loved him once,\"\r\n",
      "Longmore said with a sinking of the heart, \"and with her to love once is\r\n",
      "to commit herself for ever. Her clever husband thinks her too prim. What\r\n",
      "would a stupid poet call it?\" He relapsed with aching impotence into the\r\n",
      "sense of her being somehow beyond him, unattainable, immeasurable by his\r\n",
      "own fretful logic. Suddenly he gave three passionate switches in the air\r\n",
      "with his cane which made Madame de Mauves look round. She could hardly\r\n",
      "have guessed their signifying that where ambition was so vain the next\r\n",
      "best thing to it was the very ardour of hopelessness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She found in her drawing-room the little elderly Frenchman, M. de\r\n",
      "Chalumeau, whom Longmore had observed a few days before on the terrace.\r\n",
      "On this occasion too Madame Clairin was entertaining him, but as her\r\n",
      "sister-in-law came in she surrendered her post and addressed herself to\r\n",
      "our hero. Longmore, at thirty, was still an ingenuous youth, and\r\n",
      "there was something in this lady's large assured attack that fairly\r\n",
      "intimidated him. He was doubtless not as reassured as he ought to have\r\n",
      "been at finding he had not absolutely forfeited her favour by his want\r\n",
      "of resource during their last interview, and a suspicion of her being\r\n",
      "prepared to approach him on another line completed his distress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So you've returned from Brussels by way of the forest?\" she archly\r\n",
      "asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've not been to Brussels. I returned yesterday from Paris by the only\r\n",
      "way--by the train.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame Clairin was infinitely struck. \"I've never known a person at all\r\n",
      "to be so fond of Saint-Germain. They generally declare it's horribly\r\n",
      "dull.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's not very polite to you,\" said Longmore, vexed at his lack of\r\n",
      "superior form and determined not to be abashed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah what have I to do with it?\" Madame Clairin brightly wailed. \"I'm the\r\n",
      "dullest thing here. They've not had, other gentlemen, your success with\r\n",
      "my sister-in-law.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It would have been very easy to have it. Madame de Mauves is kindness\r\n",
      "itself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She swung open her great fan. \"To her own countrymen!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore remained silent; he hated the tone of this conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The speaker looked at him a little and then took in their hostess, to\r\n",
      "whom M. de Chalumeau was serving up another epigram, which the charming\r\n",
      "creature received with a droop of the head and eyes that strayed through\r\n",
      "the window. \"Don't pretend to tell me,\" Madame Clairin suddenly exhaled,\r\n",
      "\"that you're not in love with that pretty woman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Allons donc!\" cried Longmore in the most inspired French he had ever\r\n",
      "uttered. He rose the next minute and took a hasty farewell.\r\n",

      "VI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He allowed several days to pass without going back; it was of a sublime\r\n",
      "suitability to appear to regard his friend's frankness during their\r\n",
      "last interview as a general invitation. The sacrifice cost him a great\r\n",
      "effort, for hopeless passions are exactly not the most patient; and he\r\n",
      "had moreover a constant fear that if, as he believed, deep within the\r\n",
      "circle round which he could only hover, the hour of supreme explanations\r\n",
      "had come, the magic of her magnanimity might convert M. de Mauves.\r\n",
      "Vicious men, it was abundantly recorded, had been so converted as to be\r\n",
      "acceptable to God, and the something divine in this lady's composition\r\n",
      "would sanctify any means she should choose to employ. Her means, he kept\r\n",
      "repeating, were no business of his, and the essence of his admiration\r\n",
      "ought to be to allow her to do as she liked; but he felt as if he should\r\n",
      "turn away into a world out of which most of the joy had departed if she\r\n",
      "should like, after all, to see nothing more in his interest in her than\r\n",
      "might be repaid by mere current social coin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When at last he went back he found to his vexation that he was to run\r\n",
      "the gauntlet of Madame Clairin's officious hospitality. It was one of\r\n",
      "the first mornings of perfect summer, and the drawing-room, through the\r\n",
      "open windows, was flooded with such a confusion of odours and bird-notes\r\n",
      "as might warrant the hope that Madame de Mauves would renew with him\r\n",
      "for an hour or two the exploration of the forest. Her sister-in-law,\r\n",
      "however, whose hair was not yet dressed, emerged like a brassy discord\r\n",
      "in a maze of melody. At the same moment the servant returned with his\r\n",
      "mistress's regrets; she begged to be excused, she was indisposed and\r\n",
      "unable to see Mr. Longmore. The young man knew just how disappointed\r\n",
      "he looked and just what Madame Clairin thought of it, and this\r\n",
      "consciousness determined in him an attitude of almost aggressive\r\n",
      "frigidity. This was apparently what she desired. She wished to throw him\r\n",
      "off his balance and, if she was not mistaken, knew exactly how.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Put down your hat, Mr. Longmore,\" she said, \"and be polite for once.\r\n",
      "You were not at all polite the other day when I asked you that friendly\r\n",
      "question about the state of your heart.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"As well say you've none at all. I advise you to cultivate a little\r\n",
      "eloquence; you may have use for it. That was not an idle question of\r\n",
      "mine; I don't ask idle questions. For a couple of months now that you've\r\n",
      "been coming and going among us it seems to me you've had very few to\r\n",
      "answer of any sort.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've certainly been very well treated,\" he still dryly allowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion waited ever so little to bring out: \"Have you never felt\r\n",
      "disposed to ask any?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her look, her tone, were so charged with insidious meanings as to\r\n",
      "make him feel that even to understand her would savour of dishonest\r\n",
      "complicity. \"What is it you have to tell me?\" he cried with a flushed\r\n",
      "frown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her own colour rose at the question. It's rather hard, when you come\r\n",
      "bearing yourself very much as the sibyl when she came to the Roman king,\r\n",
      "to be treated as something worse than a vulgar gossip. \"I might tell\r\n",
      "you, monsieur,\" she returned, \"that you've as bad a ton as any young man\r\n",
      "I ever met. Where have you lived--what are your ideas? A stupid one of\r\n",
      "my own--possibly!--has been to call your attention to a fact that it\r\n",
      "takes some delicacy to touch upon. You've noticed, I suppose, that my\r\n",
      "sister-in-law isn't the happiest woman in the world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\"--Longmore made short work of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She seemed to measure his intelligence a little uncertainly. \"You've\r\n",
      "formed, I suppose,\" she nevertheless continued, \"your conception of the\r\n",
      "grounds of her discontent?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It hasn't required much forming. The grounds--or at least a specimen or\r\n",
      "two of them--have simply stared me in the face.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame Clairin considered a moment with her eyes on him. \"Yes--ces\r\n",
      "choses-la se voient. My brother, in a single word, has the deplorable\r\n",
      "habit of falling in love with other women. I don't judge him; I don't\r\n",
      "judge my sister-in-law. I only permit myself to say that in her position\r\n",
      "I would have managed otherwise. I'd either have kept my husband's\r\n",
      "affection or I'd have frankly done without it. But my sister's an odd\r\n",
      "compound; I don't profess to understand her. Therefore it is, in a\r\n",
      "measure, that I appeal to you, her fellow countryman. Of course you'll\r\n",
      "be surprised at my way of looking at the matter, and I admit that it's\r\n",
      "a way in use only among people whose history--that of a race--has\r\n",
      "cultivated in them the sense for high political solutions.\" She paused\r\n",
      "and Longmore wondered where the history of her race was going to lead\r\n",
      "her. But she clearly saw her course. \"There has never been a galant\r\n",
      "homme among us, I fear, who has not given his wife, even when she was\r\n",
      "very charming, the right to be jealous. We know our history for ages\r\n",
      "back, and the fact's established. It's not a very edifying one if you\r\n",
      "like, but it's something to have scandals with pedigrees--if you can't\r\n",
      "have them with attenuations. Our men have been Frenchmen of France, and\r\n",
      "their wives--I may say it--have been of no meaner blood. You may see\r\n",
      "all their portraits at our poor charming old house--every one of them an\r\n",
      "'injured' beauty, but not one of them hanging her head. Not one of them\r\n",
      "ever had the bad taste to be jealous, and yet not one in a dozen ever\r\n",
      "consented to an indiscretion--allowed herself, I mean, to be talked\r\n",
      "about. Voila comme elles ont su s'arranger. How they did it--go and look\r\n",
      "at the dusky faded canvases and pastels and ask. They were dear brave\r\n",
      "women of wit. When they had a headache they put on a little rouge and\r\n",
      "came to supper as usual, and when they had a heart-ache they touched up\r\n",
      "that quarter with just such another brush. These are great traditions\r\n",
      "and charming precedents, I hold, and it doesn't seem to me fair that a\r\n",
      "little American bourgeoise should come in and pretend to alter them--all\r\n",
      "to hang her modern photograph and her obstinate little air penche in the\r\n",
      "gallery of our shrewd great-grandmothers. She should fall into line, she\r\n",
      "should keep up the tone. When she married my brother I don't suppose she\r\n",
      "took him for a member of a societe de bonnes oeuvres. I don't say we're\r\n",
      "right; who IS right? But we are as history has made us, and if any one's\r\n",
      "to change it had better be our charming, but not accommodating, friend.\"\r\n",
      "Again Madame Clairin paused, again she opened and closed her great\r\n",
      "modern fan, which clattered like the screen of a shop-window. \"Let her\r\n",
      "keep up the tone!\" she prodigiously repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore felt himself gape, but he gasped an \"Ah!\" to cover it. Madame\r\n",
      "Clairin's dip into the family annals had apparently imparted an\r\n",
      "honest zeal to her indignation. \"For a long time,\" she continued, \"my\r\n",
      "belle-soeur has been taking the attitude of an injured woman, affecting\r\n",
      "a disgust with the world and shutting herself up to read free-thinking\r\n",
      "books. I've never permitted myself, you may believe, the least\r\n",
      "observation on her conduct, but I can't accept it as the last word\r\n",
      "either of taste or of tact. When a woman with her prettiness lets her\r\n",
      "husband stray away she deserves no small part of her fate. I don't wish\r\n",
      "you to agree with me--on the contrary; but I call such a woman a pure\r\n",
      "noodle. She must have bored him to death. What has passed between them\r\n",
      "for many months needn't concern us; what provocation my sister has\r\n",
      "had--monstrous, if you wish--what ennui my brother has suffered. It's\r\n",
      "enough that a week ago, just after you had ostensibly gone to Brussels,\r\n",
      "something happened to produce an explosion. She found a letter in his\r\n",
      "pocket, a photograph, a trinket, que sais-je? At any rate there was a\r\n",
      "grand scene. I didn't listen at the keyhole, and I don't know what was\r\n",
      "said; but I've reason to believe that my poor brother was hauled over\r\n",
      "the coals as I fancy none of his ancestors have ever been--even by angry\r\n",
      "ladies who weren't their wives.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore had leaned forward in silent attention with his elbows on his\r\n",
      "knees, and now, impulsively, he dropped his face into his hands. \"Ah\r\n",
      "poor poor woman!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Voila!\" said Madame Clairin. \"You pity her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pity her?\" cried Longmore, looking up with ardent eyes and forgetting\r\n",
      "the spirit of the story to which he had been treated in the miserable\r\n",
      "facts. \"Don't you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A little. But I'm not acting sentimentally--I'm acting scientifically.\r\n",
      "We've always been capable of ideas. I want to arrange things; to see\r\n",
      "my brother free to do as he chooses; to see his wife contented. Do you\r\n",
      "understand me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well, I think,\" the young man said. \"You're the most immoral\r\n",
      "person I've lately had the privilege of conversing with.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame Clairin took it calmly. \"Possibly. When was ever a great\r\n",
      "peacemaker not immoral?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah no,\" Longmore protested. \"You're too superficial to be a great\r\n",
      "peacemaker. You don't begin to know anything about Madame de Mauves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She inclined her head to one side while her fine eyes kept her\r\n",
      "visitor in view; she mused a moment and then smiled as with a certain\r\n",
      "compassionate patience. \"It's not in my interest to contradict you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It would be in your interest to learn, madam\" he resolutely returned,\r\n",
      "\"what honest men most admire in a woman--and to recognise it when you\r\n",
      "see it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was wonderful--she waited a moment. \"So you ARE in love!\" she then\r\n",
      "effectively brought out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment he thought of getting up, but he decided to stay. \"I wonder\r\n",
      "if you'd understand me,\" he said at last, \"if I were to tell you that\r\n",
      "I have for Madame de Mauves the most devoted and most respectful\r\n",
      "friendship?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You underrate my intelligence. But in that case you ought to exert your\r\n",
      "influence to put an end to these painful domestic scenes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you imagine she talks to me about her domestic scenes?\" Longmore\r\n",
      "cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion stared. \"Then your friendship isn't returned?\" And as he\r\n",
      "but ambiguously threw up his hands, \"Now, at least,\" she added, \"she'll\r\n",
      "have something to tell you. I happen to know the upshot of my brother's\r\n",
      "last interview with his wife.\" Longmore rose to his feet as a protest\r\n",
      "against the indelicacy of the position into which he had been drawn; but\r\n",
      "all that made him tender made him curious, and she caught in his averted\r\n",
      "eyes an expression that prompted her to strike her blow. \"My brother's\r\n",
      "absurdly entangled with a certain person in Paris; of course he ought\r\n",
      "not to be, but he wouldn't be my brother if he weren't. It was this\r\n",
      "irregular passion that dictated his words. 'Listen to me, madam,'\r\n",
      "he cried at last; 'let us live like people who understand life! It's\r\n",
      "unpleasant to be forced to say such things outright, but you've a way\r\n",
      "of bringing one down to the rudiments. I'm faithless, I'm heartless,\r\n",
      "I'm brutal, I'm everything horrible--it's understood. Take your revenge,\r\n",
      "console yourself: you're too charming a woman to have anything to\r\n",
      "complain of. Here's a handsome young man sighing himself into a\r\n",
      "consumption for you. Listen to your poor compatriot and you'll find that\r\n",
      "virtue's none the less becoming for being good-natured. You'll see\r\n",
      "that it's not after all such a doleful world and that there's even an\r\n",
      "advantage in having the most impudent of husbands.\"' Madame Clairin\r\n",
      "paused; Longmore had turned very pale. \"You may believe it,\" she\r\n",
      "amazingly pursued; \"the speech took place in my presence; things were\r\n",
      "done in order. And now, monsieur\"--this with a wondrous strained grimace\r\n",
      "which he was too troubled at the moment to appreciate, but which he\r\n",
      "remembered later with a kind of awe--\"we count on you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her husband said this to her face to face, as you say it to me now?\" he\r\n",
      "asked after a silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Word for word and with the most perfect politeness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And Madame de Mauves--what did she say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame Clairin smiled again. \"To such a speech as that a woman\r\n",
      "says--nothing. She had been sitting with a piece of needlework, and I\r\n",
      "think she hadn't seen Richard since their quarrel the day before. He\r\n",
      "came in with the gravity of an ambassador, and I'm sure that when he\r\n",
      "made his demande en mariage his manner wasn't more respectful. He only\r\n",
      "wanted white gloves!\" said Longmore's friend. \"My belle-soeur sat silent\r\n",
      "a few moments, drawing her stitches, and then without a word, without a\r\n",
      "glance, walked out of the room. It was just what she SHOULD have done!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" the young man repeated, \"it was just what she should have done.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I, left alone with my brother, do you know what I said?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mauvals sujet!\" he suggested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'You've done me the honour,' I said, 'to take this step in my presence.\r\n",
      "I don't pretend to qualify it. You know what you're about, and it's your\r\n",
      "own affair. But you may confide in my discretion.' Do you think he has\r\n",
      "had reason to complain of it?\" She received no answer; her visitor had\r\n",
      "slowly averted himself; he passed his gloves mechanically round the\r\n",
      "band of his hat. \"I hope,\" she cried, \"you're not going to start for\r\n",
      "Brussels!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Plainly he was much disturbed, and Madame Clairin might congratulate\r\n",
      "herself on the success of her plea for old-fashioned manners. And yet\r\n",
      "there was something that left her more puzzled than satisfied in the\r\n",
      "colourless tone with which he answered, \"No, I shall remain here for\r\n",
      "the present.\" The processes of his mind were unsociably private, and she\r\n",
      "could have fancied for a moment that he was linked with their difficult\r\n",
      "friend in some monstrous conspiracy of asceticism.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come this evening,\" she nevertheless bravely resumed. \"The rest will\r\n",
      "take care of itself. Meanwhile I shall take the liberty of telling my\r\n",
      "sister-in-law that I've repeated--in short, that I've put you au fait\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had a start but he controlled himself, speaking quietly enough. \"Tell\r\n",
      "her what you please. Nothing you can tell her will affect her conduct.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Voyons! Do you mean to tell me that a woman young, pretty, sentimental,\r\n",
      "neglected, wronged if you will--? I see you don't believe it. Believe\r\n",
      "simply in your own opportunity!\" she went on. \"But for heaven's sake, if\r\n",
      "it is to lead anywhere, don't come back with that visage de croquemort.\r\n",
      "You look as if you were going to bury your heart--not to offer it to a\r\n",
      "pretty woman. You're much better when you smile--you're very nice then.\r\n",
      "Come, do yourself justice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He remained a moment face to face with her, but his expression didn't\r\n",
      "change. \"I shall do myself justice,\" he however after an instant made\r\n",
      "answer; and abruptly, with a bow, he took his departure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt, when he found himself unobserved and outside, that he must\r\n",
      "plunge into violent action, walk fast and far and defer the opportunity\r\n",
      "for thought. He strode away into the forest, swinging his cane, throwing\r\n",
      "back his head, casting his eyes into verdurous vistas and following the\r\n",
      "road without a purpose. He felt immensely excited, but could have given\r\n",
      "no straight name to his agitation. It was a joy as all increase of\r\n",
      "freedom is joyous; something seemed to have been cleared out of his path\r\n",
      "and his destiny to have rounded a cape and brought him into sight of an\r\n",
      "open sea. But it was a pain in the degree in which his freedom somehow\r\n",
      "resolved itself into the need of despising all mankind with a single\r\n",
      "exception; and the fact that Madame de Mauves inhabited a planet\r\n",
      "contaminated by the presence of the baser multitude kept elation from\r\n",
      "seeming a pledge of ideal bliss.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There she was, at any rate, and circumstances now forced them to be\r\n",
      "intimate. She had ceased to have what men call a secret for him, and\r\n",
      "this fact itself brought with it a sort of rapture. He had no prevision\r\n",
      "that he should \"profit,\" in the vulgar sense, by the extraordinary\r\n",
      "position into which they had been thrown; it might be but a cruel trick\r\n",
      "of destiny to make hope a harsher mockery and renunciation a keener\r\n",
      "suffering. But above all this rose the conviction that she could do\r\n",
      "nothing that wouldn't quicken his attachment. It was this conviction\r\n",
      "that gross accident--all odious in itself--would force the beauty of her\r\n",
      "character into more perfect relief for him that made him stride along\r\n",
      "as if he were celebrating a spiritual feast. He rambled at hazard for a\r\n",
      "couple of hours, finding at last that he had left the forest behind him\r\n",
      "and had wandered into an unfamiliar region. It was a perfectly rural\r\n",
      "scene, and the still summer day gave it a charm for which its meagre\r\n",
      "elements but half accounted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought he had never seen anything so characteristically French;\r\n",
      "all the French novels seemed to have described it, all the French\r\n",
      "landscapists to have painted it. The fields and trees were of a cool\r\n",
      "metallic green; the grass looked as if it might stain his trousers and\r\n",
      "the foliage his hands. The clear light had a mild greyness, the sheen\r\n",
      "of silver, not of gold, was in the work-a-day sun. A great red-roofed\r\n",
      "high-stacked farmhouse, with whitewashed walls and a straggling yard,\r\n",
      "surveyed the highroad, on one side, from behind a transparent curtain of\r\n",
      "poplars. A narrow stream half-choked with emerald rushes and edged with\r\n",
      "grey aspens occupied the opposite quarter. The meadows rolled and\r\n",
      "sloped away gently to the low horizon, which was barely concealed by the\r\n",
      "continuous line of clipped and marshalled trees. The prospect was not\r\n",
      "rich, but had a frank homeliness that touched the young man's fancy.\r\n",
      "It was full of light atmosphere and diffused clearness, and if it was\r\n",
      "prosaic it was somehow sociable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore was disposed to walk further, and he advanced along the road\r\n",
      "beneath the poplars. In twenty minutes he came to a village which\r\n",
      "straggled away to the right, among orchards and potagers. On the left,\r\n",
      "at a stone's throw from the road, stood a little pink-faced inn which\r\n",
      "reminded him that he had not breakfasted, having left home with a\r\n",
      "prevision of hospitality from Madame de Mauves. In the inn he found a\r\n",
      "brick-tiled parlour and a hostess in sabots and a white cap, whom, over\r\n",
      "the omelette she speedily served him--borrowing licence from the bottle\r\n",
      "of sound red wine that accompanied it--he assured she was a true artist.\r\n",
      "To reward his compliment she invited him to smoke his cigar in her\r\n",
      "little garden behind the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here he found a tonnelle and a view of tinted crops stretching down to\r\n",
      "the stream. The tonnelle was rather close, and he preferred to lounge on\r\n",
      "a bench against the pink wall, in the sun, which was not too hot. Here,\r\n",
      "as he rested and gazed and mused, he fell into a train of thought which,\r\n",
      "in an indefinable fashion, was a soft influence from the scene about\r\n",
      "him. His heart, which had been beating fast for the past three hours,\r\n",
      "gradually checked its pulses and left him looking at life with rather a\r\n",
      "more level gaze. The friendly tavern sounds coming out through the open\r\n",
      "windows, the sunny stillness of the yellowing grain which covered\r\n",
      "so much vigorous natural life, conveyed no strained nor high-pitched\r\n",
      "message, had little to say about renunciation--nothing at all about\r\n",
      "spiritual zeal. They communicated the sense of plain ripe nature,\r\n",
      "expressed the unperverted reality of things, declared that the common\r\n",
      "lot isn't brilliantly amusing and that the part of wisdom is to grasp\r\n",
      "frankly at experience lest you miss it altogether. What reason there was\r\n",
      "for his beginning to wonder after this whether a deeply-wounded heart\r\n",
      "might be soothed and healed by such a scene, it would be difficult to\r\n",
      "explain; certain it was that as he sat there he dreamt, awake, of an\r\n",
      "unhappy woman who strolled by the slow-flowing stream before him and who\r\n",
      "pulled down the fruit-laden boughs in the orchards. He mused and mused,\r\n",
      "and at last found himself quite angry that he couldn't somehow think\r\n",
      "worse of Madame de Mauves--or at any rate think otherwise. He could\r\n",
      "fairly claim that in the romantic way he asked very little of life--made\r\n",
      "modest demands on passion: why then should his only passion be born\r\n",
      "to ill fortune? Why should his first--his last--glimpse of positive\r\n",
      "happiness be so indissolubly linked with renunciation?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is perhaps because, like many spirits of the same stock, he had\r\n",
      "in his composition a lurking principle of sacrifice, sacrifice for\r\n",
      "sacrifice's sake, to the authority of which he had ever paid due\r\n",
      "deference, that he now felt all the vehemence of rebellion. To renounce,\r\n",
      "to renounce again, to renounce for ever, was this all that youth and\r\n",
      "longing and ardour were meant for? Was experience to be muffled and\r\n",
      "mutilated like an indecent picture? Was a man to sit and deliberately\r\n",
      "condemn his future to be the blank memory of a regret rather than the\r\n",
      "long possession of a treasure? Sacrifice? The word was a trap for minds\r\n",
      "muddled by fear, an ignoble refuge of weakness. To insist now seemed not\r\n",
      "to dare, but simply to BE, to live on possible terms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His hostess came out to hang a moist cloth on the hedge, and, though her\r\n",
      "guest was sitting quietly enough, she might have imagined in his kindled\r\n",
      "eyes a flattering testimony to the quality of her wine. As she turned\r\n",
      "back into the house she was met by a young man of whom Longmore took\r\n",
      "note in spite of his high distraction. He was evidently a member of that\r\n",
      "jovial fraternity of artists whose very shabbiness has an affinity with\r\n",
      "the unestablished and unexpected in life--the element often gazed at\r\n",
      "with a certain wistfulness out of the curtained windows even of the\r\n",
      "highest respectability. Longmore was struck first with his looking like\r\n",
      "a very clever man and then with his looking like a contented one. The\r\n",
      "combination, as it was expressed in his face, might have arrested the\r\n",
      "attention of a less exasperated reasoner. He had a slouched hat and a\r\n",
      "yellow beard, a light easel under one arm, and an unfinished sketch in\r\n",
      "oils under the other. He stopped and stood talking for some moments to\r\n",
      "the landlady, while something pleasant played in his face. They were\r\n",
      "discussing the possibilities of dinner; the hostess enumerated some\r\n",
      "very savoury ones, and he nodded briskly, assenting to everything. It\r\n",
      "couldn't be, Longmore thought, that he found such ideal ease in the\r\n",
      "prospect of lamb-chops and spinach and a croute aux fruits. When the\r\n",
      "dinner had been ordered he turned up his sketch, and the good woman fell\r\n",
      "to admiring and comparing, to picking up, off by the stream-side, the\r\n",
      "objects represented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was it his work, Longmore wondered, that made him so happy? Was a\r\n",
      "strong talent the best thing in the world? The landlady went back to\r\n",
      "her kitchen, and the young painter stood, as if he were waiting for\r\n",
      "something, beside the gate which opened upon the path across the fields.\r\n",
      "Longmore sat brooding and asking himself if it weren't probably better\r\n",
      "to cultivate the arts than to cultivate the passions. Before he had\r\n",
      "answered the question the painter had grown tired of waiting. He had\r\n",
      "picked up a pebble, tossed it lightly into an upper window and called\r\n",
      "familiarly \"Claudine!\" Claudine appeared; Longmore heard her at the\r\n",
      "window, bidding the young man cultivate patience. \"But I'm losing\r\n",
      "my light,\" he said; \"I must have my shadows in the same place as\r\n",
      "yesterday.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go without me then,\" Claudine answered; \"I'll join you in ten minutes.\"\r\n",
      "Her voice was fresh and young; it represented almost aggressively to\r\n",
      "Longmore that she was as pleased as her companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't forget the Chenier,\" cried the young man, who, turning away,\r\n",
      "passed out of the gate and followed the path across the fields until\r\n",
      "he disappeared among the trees by the side of the stream. Who might\r\n",
      "Claudine be? Longmore vaguely wondered; and was she as pretty as her\r\n",
      "voice? Before long he had a chance to satisfy himself; she came out of\r\n",
      "the house with her hat and parasol, prepared to follow her companion.\r\n",
      "She had on a pink muslin dress and a little white hat, and she was as\r\n",
      "pretty as suffices almost any Frenchwoman to be pleasing. She had a\r\n",
      "clear brown skin and a bright dark eye and a step that made walking as\r\n",
      "light a matter as being blown--and this even though she happened to be\r\n",
      "at the moment not a little over-weighted. Her hands were encumbered with\r\n",
      "various articles involved in her pursuit of her friend. In one arm she\r\n",
      "held her parasol and a large roll of needlework, and in the other a\r\n",
      "shawl and a heavy white umbrella, such as painters use for sketching.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile she was trying to thrust into her pocket a paper-covered\r\n",
      "volume which Longmore saw to be the poems of Andre Chenier, and in the\r\n",
      "effort dropping the large umbrella and marking this with a half-smiled\r\n",
      "exclamation of disgust. Longmore stepped forward and picked up the\r\n",
      "umbrella, and as she, protesting her gratitude, put out her hand to take\r\n",
      "it, he recognised her as too obliging to the young man who had preceded\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've too much to carry,\" he said; \"you must let me help you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're very good, monsieur,\" she answered. \"My husband always\r\n",
      "forgets something. He can do nothing without his umbrella. He is d'une\r\n",
      "etourderie--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must allow me to carry the umbrella,\" Longmore risked; \"there's too\r\n",
      "much of it for a lady.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She assented, after many compliments to his politeness; and he walked\r\n",
      "by her side into the meadow. She went lightly and rapidly, picking her\r\n",
      "steps and glancing forward to catch a glimpse of her husband. She\r\n",
      "was graceful, she was charming, she had an air of decision and yet of\r\n",
      "accommodation, and it seemed to our friend that a young artist would\r\n",
      "work none the worse for having her seated at his side reading Chenier's\r\n",
      "iambics. They were newly married, he supposed, and evidently their path\r\n",
      "of life had none of the mocking crookedness of some others. They asked\r\n",
      "little; but what need to ask more than such quiet summer days by a shady\r\n",
      "stream, with a comrade all amiability, to say nothing of art and books\r\n",
      "and a wide unmenaced horizon? To spend such a morning, to stroll back to\r\n",
      "dinner in the red-tiled parlour of the inn, to ramble away again as the\r\n",
      "sun got low--all this was a vision of delight which floated before him\r\n",
      "only to torture him with a sense of the impossible. All Frenchwomen were\r\n",
      "not coquettes, he noted as he kept pace with his companion. She uttered\r\n",
      "a word now and then for politeness' sake, but she never looked at him\r\n",
      "and seemed not in the least to care that he was a well-favoured and\r\n",
      "well-dressed young man. She cared for nothing but the young artist in\r\n",
      "the shabby coat and the slouched hat, and for discovering where he had\r\n",
      "set up his easel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was soon done. He was encamped under the trees, close to the\r\n",
      "stream, and, in the diffused green shade of the little wood, couldn't\r\n",
      "have felt immediate need of his umbrella. He received a free rebuke,\r\n",
      "however, for forgetting it, and was informed of what he owed to\r\n",
      "Longmore's complaisance. He was duly grateful; he thanked our hero\r\n",
      "warmly and offered him a seat on the grass. But Longmore felt himself\r\n",
      "a marplot and lingered only long enough to glance at the young man's\r\n",
      "sketch and to see in it an easy rendering of the silvery stream and the\r\n",
      "vivid green rushes. The young wife had spread her shawl on the grass\r\n",
      "at the base of a tree and meant to seat herself when he had left them,\r\n",
      "meant to murmur Chenier's verses to the music of the gurgling river.\r\n",
      "Longmore looked a while from one of these lucky persons to the other,\r\n",
      "barely stifled a sigh, bade them good-morning and took his departure. He\r\n",
      "knew neither where to go nor what to do; he seemed afloat on the sea of\r\n",
      "ineffectual longing. He strolled slowly back to the inn, where, in\r\n",
      "the doorway, he met the landlady returning from the butcher's with the\r\n",
      "lambchops for the dinner of her lodgers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Monsieur has made the acquaintance of the dame of our young painter,\"\r\n",
      "she said with a free smile--a smile too free for malicious meanings.\r\n",
      "\"Monsieur has perhaps seen the young man's picture. It appears that he's\r\n",
      "d'une jolie force.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His picture's very charming,\" said Longmore, \"but his dame is more\r\n",
      "charming still.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's a very nice little woman; but I pity her all the more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't see why she's to be pitied,\" Longmore pleaded. \"They seem a\r\n",
      "very happy couple.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The landlady gave a knowing nod. \"Don't trust to it, monsieur! Those\r\n",
      "artists--ca na pas de principes! From one day to another he can plant\r\n",
      "her there! I know them, allez. I've had them here very often; one year\r\n",
      "with one, another year with another.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore was at first puzzled. Then, \"You mean she's not his wife?\" he\r\n",
      "asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She took it responsibly. \"What shall I tell you? They're not des hommes\r\n",
      "serieux, those gentlemen! They don't engage for eternity. It's none\r\n",
      "of my business, and I've no wish to speak ill of madame. She's\r\n",
      "gentille--but gentille, and she loves her jeune homme to distraction.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who then is so distinguished a young woman?\" asked Longmore. \"What do\r\n",
      "you know about her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing for certain; but it's my belief that she's better than he. I've\r\n",
      "even gone so far as to believe that she's a lady--a vraie dame--and that\r\n",
      "she has given up a great many things for him. I do the best I can for\r\n",
      "them, but I don't believe she has had all her life to put up with a\r\n",
      "dinner of two courses.\" And she turned over her lamb-chops tenderly, as\r\n",
      "to say that though a good cook could imagine better things, yet if you\r\n",
      "could have but one course lamb-chops had much in their favour. \"I shall\r\n",
      "do them with breadcrumbs. Voila les femmes, monsieur!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore turned away with the feeling that women were indeed a\r\n",
      "measureless mystery, and that it was hard to say in which of their forms\r\n",
      "of perversity there was most merit. He walked back to Saint-Germain more\r\n",
      "slowly than he had come, with less philosophic resignation to any event\r\n",
      "and more of the urgent egotism of the passion pronounced by philosophers\r\n",
      "the supremely selfish one. Now and then the episode of the happy young\r\n",
      "painter and the charming woman who had given up a great many things for\r\n",
      "him rose vividly in his mind and seemed to mock his moral unrest like\r\n",
      "some obtrusive vision of unattainable bliss.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The landlady's gossip had cast no shadow on its brightness; her voice\r\n",
      "seemed that of the vulgar chorus of the uninitiated, which stands always\r\n",
      "ready with its gross prose rendering of the inspired passages of human\r\n",
      "action. Was it possible a man could take THAT from a woman--take all\r\n",
      "that lent lightness to that other woman's footstep and grace to her\r\n",
      "surrender and not give her the absolute certainty of a devotion as\r\n",
      "unalterable as the process of the sun? Was it possible that so clear\r\n",
      "a harmony had the seeds of trouble, that the charm of so perfect union\r\n",
      "could be broken by anything but death? Longmore felt an immense desire\r\n",
      "to cry out a thousand times \"No!\" for it seemed to him at last that\r\n",
      "he was somehow only a graver equivalent of the young lover and that\r\n",
      "rustling Claudine was a lighter sketch of Madame de Mauves. The heat of\r\n",
      "the sun, as he walked along, became oppressive, and when he re-entered\r\n",
      "the forest he turned aside into the deepest shade he could find and\r\n",
      "stretched himself on the mossy ground at the foot of a great beech. He\r\n",
      "lay for a while staring up into the verdurous dusk overhead and trying\r\n",
      "mentally to see his friend at Saint-Germain hurry toward some quiet\r\n",
      "stream-side where HE waited, as he had seen that trusting creature hurry\r\n",
      "an hour before. It would be hard to say how well he succeeded; but the\r\n",
      "effort soothed rather than excited him, and as he had had a good deal\r\n",
      "both of moral and physical fatigue he sank at last into a quiet sleep.\r\n",
      "While he slept moreover he had a strange and vivid dream. He seemed\r\n",
      "to be in a wood, very much like the one on which his eyes had lately\r\n",
      "closed; but the wood was divided by the murmuring stream he had left an\r\n",
      "hour before. He was walking up and down, he thought, restlessly and in\r\n",
      "intense expectation of some momentous event. Suddenly, at a distance,\r\n",
      "through the trees, he saw a gleam of a woman's dress, on which he\r\n",
      "hastened to meet her. As he advanced he recognised her, but he saw at\r\n",
      "the same time that she was on the other bank of the river. She seemed at\r\n",
      "first not to notice him, but when they had come to opposite places she\r\n",
      "stopped and looked at him very gravely and pityingly. She made him no\r\n",
      "sign that he must cross the stream, but he wished unutterably to stand\r\n",
      "by her side. He knew the water was deep, and it seemed to him he knew\r\n",
      "how he should have to breast it and how he feared that when he rose to\r\n",
      "the surface she would have disappeared. Nevertheless he was going to\r\n",
      "plunge when a boat turned into the current from above and came swiftly\r\n",
      "toward them, guided by an oarsman who was sitting so that they couldn't\r\n",
      "see his face. He brought the boat to the bank where Longmore stood;\r\n",
      "the latter stepped in, and with a few strokes they touched the opposite\r\n",
      "shore. Longmore got out and, though he was sure he had crossed the\r\n",
      "stream, Madame de Mauves was not there. He turned with a kind of agony\r\n",
      "and saw that now she was on the other bank--the one he had left. She\r\n",
      "gave him a grave silent glance and walked away up the stream. The boat\r\n",
      "and the boatman resumed their course, but after going a short distance\r\n",
      "they stopped and the boatman turned back and looked at the still divided\r\n",
      "couple. Then Longmore recognised him--just as he had recognised him a\r\n",
      "few days before at the restaurant in the Bois de Boulogne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VIII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He must have slept some time after he ceased dreaming for he had no\r\n",
      "immediate memory of this vision. It came back to him later, after he\r\n",
      "had roused himself and had walked nearly home. No great arrangement was\r\n",
      "needed to make it seem a striking allegory, and it haunted and oppressed\r\n",
      "him for the rest of the day. He took refuge, however, in his quickened\r\n",
      "conviction that the only sound policy in life is to grasp unsparingly\r\n",
      "at happiness; and it seemed no more than one of the vigorous measures\r\n",
      "dictated by such a policy to return that evening to Madame de Mauves.\r\n",
      "And yet when he had decided to do so and had carefully dressed himself\r\n",
      "he felt an irresistible nervous tremor which made it easier to linger\r\n",
      "at his open window, wondering with a strange mixture of dread and desire\r\n",
      "whether Madame Clairin had repeated to her sister-in-law what she had\r\n",
      "said to him. His presence now might be simply a gratuitous annoyance,\r\n",
      "and yet his absence might seem to imply that it was in the power of\r\n",
      "circumstances to make them ashamed to meet each other's eyes. He sat\r\n",
      "a long time with his head in his hands, lost in a painful confusion of\r\n",
      "hopes and ambiguities. He felt at moments as if he could throttle Madame\r\n",
      "Clairin, and yet couldn't help asking himself if it weren't possible she\r\n",
      "had done him a service. It was late when he left the hotel, and as he\r\n",
      "entered the gate of the other house his heart beat so fast that he was\r\n",
      "sure his voice would show it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The servant ushered him into the drawing-room, which was empty and with\r\n",
      "the lamp burning low. But the long windows were open and their light\r\n",
      "curtains swaying in a soft warm wind, so that Longmore immediately\r\n",
      "stepped out upon the terrace. There he found Madame de Mauves alone,\r\n",
      "slowly pacing its length. She was dressed in white, very simply, and her\r\n",
      "hair was arranged not as she usually wore it, but in a single loose coil\r\n",
      "and as if she were unprepared for company. She stopped when she saw her\r\n",
      "friend, showed some surprise, uttered an exclamation and stood waiting\r\n",
      "for him to speak. He tried, with his eyes on her, to say something,\r\n",
      "but found no words. He knew it was awkward, it was offensive, to stand\r\n",
      "gazing at her; but he couldn't say what was suitable and mightn't say\r\n",
      "what he wished. Her face was indistinct in the dim light, but he felt\r\n",
      "her eyes fixed on him and wondered what they expressed. Did they warn\r\n",
      "him, did they plead, or did they confess to a sense of provocation? For\r\n",
      "an instant his head swam; he was sure it would make all things clear to\r\n",
      "stride forward and fold her in his arms. But a moment later he was still\r\n",
      "dumb there before her; he hadn't moved; he knew she had spoken, but he\r\n",
      "hadn't understood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You were here this morning,\" she continued; and now, slowly, the\r\n",
      "meaning of her words came to him. \"I had a bad headache and had to shut\r\n",
      "myself up.\" She spoke with her usual voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore mastered his agitation and answered her without betraying\r\n",
      "himself. \"I hope you're better now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, thank you, I'm better--much better.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waited again and she moved away to a chair and seated herself. After\r\n",
      "a pause he followed her and leaned closer to her, against the balustrade\r\n",
      "of the terrace. \"I hoped you might have been able to come out for the\r\n",
      "morning into the forest. I went alone; it was a lovely day, and I took a\r\n",
      "long walk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was a lovely day,\" she said absently, and sat with her eyes lowered,\r\n",
      "slowly opening and closing her fan. Longmore, as he watched her, felt\r\n",
      "more and more assured her sister-in-law had seen her since her interview\r\n",
      "with him; that her attitude toward him was changed. It was this same\r\n",
      "something that hampered the desire with which he had come, or at least\r\n",
      "converted all his imagined freedom of speech about it to a final hush of\r\n",
      "wonder. No, certainly, he couldn't clasp her to his arms now, any more\r\n",
      "than some antique worshipper could have clasped the marble statue in his\r\n",
      "temple. But Longmore's statue spoke at last with a full human voice and\r\n",
      "even with a shade of human hesitation. She looked up, and it seemed to\r\n",
      "him her eyes shone through the dusk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm very glad you came this evening--and I've a particular reason\r\n",
      "for being glad. I half-expected you, and yet I thought it possible you\r\n",
      "mightn't come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As the case has been present to me,\" Longmore answered, \"it was\r\n",
      "impossible I shouldn't come. I've spent every minute of the day in\r\n",
      "thinking of you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She made no immediate reply, but continued to open and close her fan\r\n",
      "thoughtfully. At last, \"I've something important to say to you,\" she\r\n",
      "resumed with decision. \"I want you to know to a certainty that I've\r\n",
      "a very high opinion of you.\" Longmore gave an uneasy shift to his\r\n",
      "position. To what was she coming? But he said nothing, and she went on:\r\n",
      "\"I take a great interest in you. There's no reason why I shouldn't\r\n",
      "say it. I feel a great friendship for you.\" He began to laugh, all\r\n",
      "awkwardly--he hardly knew why, unless because this seemed the very irony\r\n",
      "of detachment. But she went on in her way: \"You know, I suppose, that a\r\n",
      "great disappointment always implies a great confidence--a great hope.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've certainly hoped,\" he said, \"hoped strongly; but doubtless never\r\n",
      "rationally enough to have a right to bemoan my disappointment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was something troubled in her face that seemed all the while to\r\n",
      "burn clearer. \"You do yourself injustice. I've such confidence in your\r\n",
      "fairness of mind that I should be greatly disappointed if I were to find\r\n",
      "it wanting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I really almost believe you're amusing yourself at my expense,\" the\r\n",
      "young man cried. \"My fairness of mind? Of all the question-begging\r\n",
      "terms!\" he laughed. \"The only thing for one's mind to be fair to is the\r\n",
      "thing one FEELS!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She rose to her feet and looked at him hard. His eyes by this time were\r\n",
      "accustomed to the imperfect light, and he could see that if she was\r\n",
      "urgent she was yet beseechingly kind. She shook her head impatiently and\r\n",
      "came near enough to lay her fan on his arm with a strong pressure. \"If\r\n",
      "that were so it would be a weary world. I know enough, however, of your\r\n",
      "probable attitude. You needn't try to express it. It's enough that your\r\n",
      "sincerity gives me the right to ask a favour of you--to make an intense,\r\n",
      "a solemn request.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Make it; I listen.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"DON'T DISAPPOINT ME. If you don't understand me now you will to-morrow\r\n",
      "or very soon. When I said just now that I had a high opinion of you,\r\n",
      "you see I meant it very seriously,\" she explained. \"It wasn't a vain\r\n",
      "compliment. I believe there's no appeal one may make to your generosity\r\n",
      "that can remain long unanswered. If this were to happen--if I were to\r\n",
      "find you selfish where I thought you generous, narrow where I thought\r\n",
      "you large\"--and she spoke slowly, her voice lingering with all emphasis\r\n",
      "on each of these words--\"vulgar where I thought you rare, I should think\r\n",
      "worse of human nature. I should take it, I assure you, very hard indeed.\r\n",
      "I should say to myself in the dull days of the future: 'There was ONE\r\n",
      "man who might have done so and so, and he too failed.' But this shan't\r\n",
      "be. You've made too good an impression on me not to make the very best.\r\n",
      "If you wish to please me for ever there's a way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was standing close to him, with her dress touching him, her\r\n",
      "eyes fixed on his. As she went on her tone became, to his sense,\r\n",
      "extraordinary, and she offered the odd spectacle of a beautiful woman\r\n",
      "preaching reason with the most communicative and irresistible passion.\r\n",
      "Longmore was dazzled, but mystified and bewildered. The intention of\r\n",
      "her words was all remonstrance, refusal, dismissal, but her presence\r\n",
      "and effect there, so close, so urgent, so personal, a distracting\r\n",
      "contradiction of it. She had never been so lovely. In her white dress,\r\n",
      "with her pale face and deeply-lighted brow, she seemed the very spirit\r\n",
      "of the summer night. When she had ceased speaking she drew a long\r\n",
      "breath; he felt it on his cheek, and it stirred in his whole being\r\n",
      "a sudden perverse imagination. Were not her words, in their high\r\n",
      "impossible rigour, a mere challenge to his sincerity, a mere precaution\r\n",
      "of her pride, meant to throw into relief her almost ghostly beauty, and\r\n",
      "wasn't this the only truth, the only law, the only thing to take account\r\n",
      "of?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He closed his eyes and felt her watch him not without pain and\r\n",
      "perplexity herself. He looked at her again, met her own eyes and saw\r\n",
      "them fill with strange tears. Then this last sophistry of his great\r\n",
      "desire for her knew itself touched as a bubble is pricked; it died away\r\n",
      "with a stifled murmur, and her beauty, more and more radiant in the\r\n",
      "darkness, rose before him as a symbol of something vague which was yet\r\n",
      "more beautiful than itself. \"I may understand you to-morrow,\" he said,\r\n",
      "\"but I don't understand you now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet I took counsel with myself to-day and asked myself how I had\r\n",
      "best speak to you. On one side I might have refused to see you at all.\"\r\n",
      "Longmore made a violent movement, and she added: \"In that case I should\r\n",
      "have written to you. I might see you, I thought, and simply say to you\r\n",
      "that there were excellent reasons why we should part, and that I begged\r\n",
      "this visit should be your last. This I inclined to do; what made me\r\n",
      "decide otherwise was--well, simply that I like you so. I said to myself\r\n",
      "that I should be glad to remember in future days, not that I had, in the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "even to think of you as making a great sacrifice. I want to think of\r\n",

      "She turned impatiently away and walked to the other end of the terrace.\r\n",
      "When she came back he saw that her impatience had grown sharp and almost\r\n",
      "hard. She stood before him again, looking at him from head to foot\r\n",
      "and without consideration now; so that as the effect of it he felt his\r\n",
      "assurance finally quite sink. This then she took from him, withholding\r\n",
      "in consequence something she had meant to say. She moved off afresh,\r\n",
      "walked to the other end of the terrace and stood there with her face to\r\n",
      "the garden. She assumed that he understood her, and slowly, slowly, half\r\n",
      "as the fruit of this mute pressure, he let everything go but the rage of\r\n",
      "a purpose somehow still to please her. She was giving him a chance to do\r\n",
      "gallantly what it seemed unworthy of both of them he should do meanly.\r\n",
      "She must have \"liked\" him indeed, as she said, to wish so to spare him,\r\n",
      "to go to the trouble of conceiving an ideal of conduct for him. With\r\n",
      "this sense of her tenderness still in her dreadful consistency, his\r\n",
      "spirit rose with a new flight and suddenly felt itself breathe clearer\r\n",
      "air. Her profession ceased to seem a mere bribe to his eagerness; it was\r\n",
      "charged with eagerness itself; it was a present reward and would somehow\r\n",
      "last. He moved rapidly toward her as with the sense of a gage that he\r\n",
      "might sublimely yet immediately enjoy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were separated by two thirds of the length of the terrace, and he\r\n",
      "had to pass the drawing-room window. As he did so he started with an\r\n",
      "exclamation. Madame Clairin stood framed in the opening as if, though\r\n",
      "just arriving on the scene, she too were already aware of its interest.\r\n",
      "Conscious, apparently, that she might be suspected of having watched\r\n",

      "Madame de Mauves turned to her, but answered nothing. She looked\r\n",
      "straight at Longmore, and her eyes shone with a lustre that struck him\r\n",
      "as divine. He was not exactly sure indeed what she meant them to say,\r\n",
      "but it translated itself to something that would do. \"Call it what you\r\n",
      "will, what you've wanted to urge upon me is the thing this woman can\r\n",
      "best conceive. What I ask of you is something she can't begin to!\" They\r\n",

      "and to intimate--yet this too all decently--how little that self was\r\n",
      "of Madame Clairin's particular swelling measure. He felt an immense\r\n",
      "answering desire not to do anything then that might seem probable or\r\n",
      "prevu to this lady. He had laid his hat and stick on the parapet of the\r\n",
      "terrace. He took them up, offered his hand to Madame de Mauves with a\r\n",

      "He went home and, without lighting his candle, flung himself on his\r\n",
      "bed. But he got no sleep till morning; he lay hour after hour tossing,\r\n",
      "thinking, wondering; his mind had never been so active. It seemed to him\r\n",
      "his friend had laid on him in those last moments a heavy charge and\r\n",
      "had expressed herself almost as handsomely as if she had listened\r\n",
      "complacently to an assurance of his love. It was neither easy nor\r\n",
      "delightful thoroughly to understand her; but little by little her\r\n",
      "perfect meaning sank into his mind and soothed it with a sense of\r\n",
      "opportunity which somehow stifled his sense of loss. For, to begin with,\r\n",
      "she meant that she could love him in no degree or contingency, in no\r\n",
      "imaginable future. This was absolute--he knew he could no more alter\r\n",
      "it than he could pull down one of the constellations he lay gazing at\r\n",
      "through his open window. He wondered to what it was, in the background\r\n",
      "of her life, she had so dedicated herself. A conception of duty\r\n",
      "unquenchable to the end? A love that no outrage could stifle? \"Great\r\n",
      "heaven!\" he groaned; \"is the world so rich in the purest pearls of\r\n",
      "passion that such tenderness as that can be wasted for ever--poured\r\n",
      "away without a sigh into bottomless darkness?\" Had she, in spite of the\r\n",
      "detestable present, some precious memory that still kept the door of\r\n",
      "possibility open? Was she prepared to submit to everything and yet to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Longmore sank back with a sigh and an oppressive feeling that it was\r\n",
      "vain to guess at such a woman's motives. He only felt that those of this\r\n",
      "one were buried deep in her soul and that they must be of the noblest,\r\n",
      "must contain nothing base. He had his hard impression that endless\r\n",
      "constancy was all her law--a constancy that still found a foothold among\r\n",
      "crumbling ruins. \"She has loved once,\" he said to himself as he rose\r\n",
      "and wandered to his window; \"and that's for ever. Yes, yes--if she loved\r\n",
      "again she'd be COMMON!\" He stood for a long time looking out into the\r\n",
      "starlit silence of the town and forest and thinking of what life would\r\n",
      "have been if his constancy had met her own in earlier days. But life was\r\n",
      "this now, and he must live. It was living, really, to stand there with\r\n",
      "such a faith even in one's self still flung over one by such hands.\r\n",
      "He was not to disappoint her, he was to justify a conception it had\r\n",
      "beguiled her weariness to form. His imagination embraced it; he threw\r\n",
      "back his head and seemed to be looking for his friend's conception\r\n",
      "among the blinking mocking stars. But it came to him rather on the mild\r\n",
      "night-wind wandering in over the house-tops which covered the rest of\r\n",
      "so many heavy human hearts. What she asked he seemed to feel her ask not\r\n",
      "for her own sake--she feared nothing, she needed nothing--but for that\r\n",
      "of his own happiness and his own character. He must assent to destiny.\r\n",
      "Why else was he young and strong, intelligent and resolute? He mustn't\r\n",
      "give it to her to reproach him with thinking she had had a moment's\r\n",
      "attention for his love, give it to her to plead, to argue, to break off\r\n",
      "in bitterness. He must see everything from above, her indifference and\r\n",
      "his own ardour; he must prove his strength, must do the handsome thing,\r\n",
      "must decide that the handsome thing was to submit to the inevitable, to\r\n",
      "be supremely delicate, to spare her all pain, to stifle his passion,\r\n",
      "to ask no compensation, to depart without waiting and to try to believe\r\n",
      "that wisdom is its own reward. All this, neither more nor less, it was\r\n",
      "a matter of beautiful friendship with him for her to expect of him. And\r\n",
      "what should he himself gain by it? He should have pleased her! Well,\r\n",
      "he flung himself on his bed again, fell asleep at last and slept till\r\n",
      "morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before noon next day he had made up his mind to leave Saint-Germain at\r\n",
      "once. It seemed easiest to go without seeing her, and yet if he might\r\n",
      "ask for a grain of \"compensation\" this would be five minutes face to\r\n",
      "face with her. He passed a restless day. Wherever he went he saw her\r\n",
      "stand before him in the dusky halo of evening, saw her look at him with\r\n",
      "an air of still negation more intoxicating than the most passionate\r\n",
      "self-surrender. He must certainly go, and yet it was hideously hard. He\r\n",
      "compromised and went to Paris to spend the rest of the day. He strolled\r\n",
      "along the boulevard and paused sightlessly before the shops, sat a while\r\n",
      "in the Tuileries gardens and looked at the shabby unfortunates for whom\r\n",
      "this only was nature and summer; but simply felt afresh, as a result\r\n",
      "of it all, the dusty dreary lonely world to which Madame de Mauves had\r\n",
      "consigned him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a sombre mood he made his way back to the centre of motion and sat\r\n",
      "down at a table before a cafe door, on the great plain of hot asphalt.\r\n",
      "Night arrived, the lamps were lighted, the tables near him found\r\n",
      "occupants, and Paris began to wear that evening grimace of hers that\r\n",
      "seems to tell, in the flare of plate glass and of theatre-doors, the\r\n",
      "muffled rumble of swift-rolling carriages, how this is no world for\r\n",
      "you unless you have your pockets lined and your delicacies perverted.\r\n",
      "Longmore, however, had neither scruples nor desires; he looked at\r\n",
      "the great preoccupied place for the first time with an easy sense\r\n",
      "of repaying its indifference. Before long a carriage drove up to the\r\n",
      "pavement directly in front of him and remained standing for several\r\n",
      "minutes without sign from its occupant. It was one of those neat plain\r\n",
      "coupes, drawn by a single powerful horse, in which the flaneur figures\r\n",
      "a pale handsome woman buried among silk cushions and yawning as she sees\r\n",
      "the gas-lamps glittering in the gutters. At last the door opened and out\r\n",
      "stepped Richard de Mauves. He stopped and leaned on the window for some\r\n",
      "time, talking in an excited manner to a person within. At last he gave a\r\n",
      "nod and the carriage rolled away. He stood swinging his cane and looking\r\n",
      "up and down the boulevard, with the air of a man fumbling, as one\r\n",
      "might say, the loose change of time. He turned toward the cafe and was\r\n",
      "apparently, for want of anything better worth his attention, about to\r\n",
      "seat himself at one of the tables when he noticed Longmore. He wavered\r\n",
      "an instant and then, without a shade of difference in his careless gait,\r\n",
      "advanced to the accompaniment of a thin recognition. It was the first\r\n",
      "time they had met since their encounter in the forest after Longmore's\r\n",
      "false start for Brussels. Madame Clairin's revelations, as he might have\r\n",
      "regarded them, had not made the Count especially present to his mind; he\r\n",
      "had had another call to meet than the call of disgust. But now, as M. de\r\n",
      "Mauves came toward him he felt abhorrence well up. He made out, however,\r\n",
      "for the first time, a cloud on this nobleman's superior clearness, and a\r\n",
      "delight at finding the shoe somewhere at last pinching HIM, mingled with\r\n",
      "the resolve to be blank and unaccommodating, enabled him to meet the\r\n",
      "occasion with due promptness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves sat down, and the two men looked at each other across the\r\n",
      "table, exchanging formal remarks that did little to lend grace to their\r\n",
      "encounter. Longmore had no reason to suppose the Count knew of his\r\n",
      "sister's various interventions. He was sure M. de Mauves cared very\r\n",
      "little about his opinions, and yet he had a sense of something grim in\r\n",
      "his own New York face which would have made him change colour if keener\r\n",
      "suspicion had helped it to be read there. M. de Mauves didn't change\r\n",
      "colour, but he looked at his wife's so oddly, so more than naturally\r\n",
      "(wouldn't it be?) detached friend with an intentness that betrayed at\r\n",
      "once an irritating memory of the episode in the Bois de Boulogne and\r\n",
      "such vigilant curiosity as was natural to a gentleman who had entrusted\r\n",
      "his \"honour\" to another gentleman's magnanimity--or to his artlessness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It might appear that these virtues shone out of our young man less\r\n",
      "engagingly or reassuringly than a few days before; the shadow at any\r\n",
      "rate fell darker across the brow of his critic, who turned away and\r\n",
      "frowned while lighting a cigar. The person in the coupe, he accordingly\r\n",
      "judged, whether or no the same person as the heroine of the episode of\r\n",
      "the Bois de Boulogne, was not a source of unalloyed delight. Longmore\r\n",
      "had dark blue eyes of admirable clarity, settled truth-telling eyes\r\n",
      "which had in his childhood always made his harshest taskmasters smile at\r\n",
      "his notion of a subterfuge. An observer watching the two men and knowing\r\n",
      "something of their relations would certainly have said that what he had\r\n",
      "at last both to recognise and to miss in those eyes must not a little\r\n",
      "have puzzled and tormented M. de Mauves. They took possession of him,\r\n",
      "they laid him out, they measured him in that state of flatness, they\r\n",
      "triumphed over him, they treated him as no pair of eyes had perhaps ever\r\n",
      "treated any member of his family before. The Count's scheme had been to\r\n",
      "provide for a positive state of ease on the part of no one save himself,\r\n",
      "but here was Longmore already, if appearances perhaps not appreciable to\r\n",
      "the vulgar meant anything, primed as for some prospect of pleasure more\r\n",
      "than Parisian. Was this candid young barbarian but a faux bonhomme after\r\n",
      "all? He had never really quite satisfied his occasional host, but was he\r\n",
      "now, for a climax, to leave him almost gaping?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves, as if hating to seem preoccupied, took up the evening\r\n",
      "paper to help himself to seem indifferent. As he glanced over it he\r\n",
      "threw off some perfunctory allusion to the crisis--the political--which\r\n",
      "enabled Longmore to reply with perfect veracity that, with other things\r\n",
      "to think about, he had had no attention to spare for it. And yet our\r\n",
      "hero was in truth far from secure against rueful reflexion. The Count's\r\n",
      "ruffled state was a comfort so far as it pointed to the possibility\r\n",
      "that the lady in the coupe might be proving too many for him; but it\r\n",
      "ministered to no vindictive sweetness for Longmore so far as it should\r\n",
      "perhaps represent rising jealousy. It passed through his mind that\r\n",
      "jealousy is a passion with a double face and that on one of its sides it\r\n",
      "may sometimes almost look generous. It glimmered upon him odiously M. de\r\n",
      "Mauves might grow ashamed of his political compact with his wife, and\r\n",
      "he felt how far more tolerable it would be in future to think of him as\r\n",
      "always impertinent than to think of him as occasionally contrite.\r\n",
      "The two men pretended meanwhile for half an hour to outsit each other\r\n",
      "conveniently; and the end--at that rate--might have been distant had not\r\n",
      "the tension in some degree yielded to the arrival of a friend of M. de\r\n",
      "Mauves--a tall pale consumptive-looking dandy who filled the air with\r\n",
      "the odour of heliotrope. He looked up and down the boulevard wearily,\r\n",
      "examined the Count's garments in some detail, then appeared to refer\r\n",
      "restlessly to his own, and at last announced resignedly that the Duchess\r\n",
      "was in town. M. de Mauves must come with him to call; she had abused him\r\n",
      "dreadfully a couple of evenings before--a sure sign she wanted to see\r\n",
      "him. \"I depend on you,\" said with an infantine drawl this specimen of\r\n",
      "an order Longmore felt he had never had occasion so intimately to\r\n",
      "appreciate, \"to put her en train.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves resisted, he protested that he was d'une humeur\r\n",
      "massacrante; but at last he allowed himself to be drawn to his feet\r\n",
      "and stood looking awkwardly--awkwardly for M. de Mauves--at Longmore.\r\n",
      "\"You'll excuse me,\" he appeared to find some difficulty in saying; \"you\r\n",
      "too probably have occupation for the evening?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"None but to catch my train.\" And our friend looked at his watch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you go back to Saint-Germain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In half an hour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves seemed on the point of disengaging himself from his\r\n",
      "companion's arm, which was locked in his own; but on the latter's\r\n",
      "uttering some persuasive murmur he lifted his hat stiffly and turned\r\n",
      "away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore the next day wandered off to the terrace to try and beguile\r\n",
      "the restlessness with which he waited for the evening; he wished to see\r\n",
      "Madame de Mauves for the last time at the hour of long shadows and\r\n",
      "pale reflected amber lights, as he had almost always seen her. Destiny,\r\n",
      "however, took no account of this humble plea for poetic justice; it\r\n",
      "was appointed him to meet her seated by the great walk under a tree and\r\n",
      "alone. The hour made the place almost empty; the day was warm, but as\r\n",
      "he took his place beside her a light breeze stirred the leafy edges of\r\n",
      "their broad circle of shadow. She looked at him almost with no pretence\r\n",
      "of not having believed herself already rid of him, and he at once told\r\n",
      "her that he should leave Saint-Germain that evening, but must first bid\r\n",
      "her farewell. Her face lighted a moment, he fancied, as he spoke; but\r\n",
      "she said nothing, only turning it off to far Paris which lay twinkling\r\n",
      "and flashing through hot exhalations. \"I've a request to make of you,\"\r\n",
      "he added. \"That you think of me as a man who has felt much and claimed\r\n",
      "little.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She drew a long breath which almost suggested pain. \"I can't think of\r\n",
      "you as unhappy. That's impossible. You've a life to lead, you've duties,\r\n",
      "talents, inspirations, interests. I shall hear of your career. And\r\n",
      "then,\" she pursued after a pause, though as if it had before this quite\r\n",
      "been settled between them, \"one can't be unhappy through having a better\r\n",
      "opinion of a friend instead of a worse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment he failed to understand her. \"Do you mean that there can be\r\n",
      "varying degrees in my opinion of you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She rose and pushed away her chair. \"I mean,\" she said quickly, \"that\r\n",
      "it's better to have done nothing in bitterness--nothing in passion.\" And\r\n",
      "she began to walk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore followed her without answering at first. But he took off his\r\n",
      "hat and with his pocket-handkerchief wiped his forehead. \"Where shall\r\n",
      "you go? what shall you do?\" he simply asked at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do? I shall do as I've always done--except perhaps that I shall go for\r\n",
      "a while to my husband's old home.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall go to MY old one. I've done with Europe for the present,\" the\r\n",
      "young man added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She glanced at him as he walked beside her, after he had spoken these\r\n",
      "words, and then bent her eyes for a long time on the ground. But\r\n",
      "suddenly, as if aware of her going too far she stopped and put out her\r\n",
      "hand. \"Good-bye. May you have all the happiness you deserve!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took her hand with his eyes on her, but something was at work in\r\n",
      "him that made it impossible to deal in the easy way with her touch.\r\n",
      "Something of infinite value was floating past him, and he had taken an\r\n",
      "oath, with which any such case interfered, not to raise a finger to stop\r\n",
      "it. It was borne by the strong current of the world's great life and not\r\n",
      "of his own small one. Madame de Mauves disengaged herself, gathered in\r\n",
      "her long scarf and smiled at him almost as you would do at a child\r\n",
      "you should wish to encourage. Several moments later he was still there\r\n",

      "himself, walked at once back to his hotel and, without waiting for the\r\n",
      "evening train, paid his bill and departed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Later in the day M. de Mauves came into his wife's drawing-room, where\r\n",
      "she sat waiting to be summoned to dinner. He had dressed as he usually\r\n",
      "didn't dress for dining at home. He walked up and down for some moments\r\n",
      "in silence, then rang the bell for a servant and went out into the hall\r\n",
      "to meet him. He ordered the carriage to take him to the station, paused\r\n",
      "a moment with his hand on the knob of the door, dismissed the\r\n",
      "servant angrily as the latter lingered observing him, re-entered the\r\n",
      "drawing-room, resumed his restless walk and at last stopped abruptly\r\n",
      "before his wife, who had taken up a book. \"May I ask the favour,\" he\r\n",
      "said with evident effort, in spite of a forced smile as of allusion to\r\n",
      "a large past exercise of the very best taste, \"of having a question\r\n",
      "answered?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a favour I never refused,\" she replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very true. Do you expect this evening a visit from Mr. Longmore?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Longmore,\" said his wife, \"has left Saint-Germain.\" M. de Mauves\r\n",
      "waited, but his smile expired. \"Mr. Longmore,\" his wife continued, \"has\r\n",
      "gone to America.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. de Mauves took it--a rare thing for him--with confessed, if\r\n",
      "momentary, intellectual indigence. But he raised, as it were, the wind.\r\n",
      "\"Has anything happened?\" he asked, \"Had he a sudden call?\" But his\r\n",
      "question received no answer. At the same moment the servant threw open\r\n",
      "the door and announced dinner; Madame Clairin rustled in, rubbing her\r\n",
      "white hands, Madame de Mauves passed silently into the dining-room,\r\n",
      "but he remained outside--outside of more things, clearly, than his mere\r\n",
      "salle-a-manger. Before long he went forth to the terrace and continued\r\n",
      "his uneasy walk. At the end of a quarter of an hour the servant came to\r\n",
      "let him know that his carriage was at the door. \"Send it away,\" he said\r\n",
      "without hesitation. \"I shan't use it.\" When the ladies had half-finished\r\n",
      "dinner he returned and joined them, with a formal apology to his wife\r\n",
      "for his inconsequence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dishes were brought back, but he hardly tasted them; he drank on\r\n",
      "the other hand more wine than usual. There was little talk, scarcely a\r\n",
      "convivial sound save the occasional expressive appreciative \"M-m-m!\" of\r\n",
      "Madame Clairin over the succulence of some dish. Twice this lady saw\r\n",
      "her brother's eyes, fixed on her own over his wineglass, put to her a\r\n",
      "question she knew she should have to irritate him later on by not being\r\n",
      "able to answer. She replied, for the present at least, by an elevation\r\n",
      "of the eyebrows that resembled even to her own humour the vain raising\r\n",
      "of an umbrella in anticipation of a storm. M. de Mauves was left alone\r\n",
      "to finish his wine; he sat over it for more than an hour and let the\r\n",
      "darkness gather about him. At last the servant came in with a letter and\r\n",
      "lighted a candle. The letter was a telegram, which M. de Mauves, when\r\n",
      "he had read it, burnt at the candle. After five minutes' meditation\r\n",
      "he wrote a message on the back of a visiting-card and gave it to the\r\n",
      "servant to carry to the office. The man knew quite as much as his master\r\n",
      "suspected about the lady to whom the telegram was addressed; but its\r\n",
      "contents puzzled him; they consisted of the single word \"Impossible.\" As\r\n",
      "the evening passed without her brother's reappearing in the drawing-room\r\n",
      "Madame Clairin came to him where he sat by his solitary candle. He\r\n",
      "took no notice of her presence for some time, but this affected her\r\n",
      "as unexpected indulgence. At last, however, he spoke with a particular\r\n",
      "harshness. \"Ce jeune mufle has gone home at an hour's notice. What the\r\n",
      "devil does it mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame Clairin now felt thankful for her umbrella. \"It means that I've a\r\n",
      "sister-in-law whom I've not the honour to understand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He said nothing more and silently allowed her, after a little, to\r\n",
      "depart. It had been her duty to provide him with an explanation, and he\r\n",
      "was disgusted with her blankness; but she was--if there was no more to\r\n",
      "come--getting off easily. When she had gone he went into the garden and\r\n",
      "walked up and down with his cigar. He saw his wife seated alone on the\r\n",
      "terrace, but remained below, wandering, turning, pausing, lingering.\r\n",
      "He remained a long time. It grew late and Madame de Mauves disappeared.\r\n",
      "Toward midnight he dropped upon a bench, tired, with a long vague\r\n",
      "exhalation of unrest. It was sinking into his spirit that he too didn't\r\n",
      "understand Madame Clairin's sister-in-law.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore was obliged to wait a week in London for a ship. It was very\r\n",
      "hot, and he went out one day to Richmond. In the garden of the hotel at\r\n",
      "which he dined he met his friend Mrs. Draper, who was staying there.\r\n",
      "She made eager enquiry about Madame de Mauves; but Longmore at first,\r\n",
      "as they sat looking out at the famous view of the Thames, parried her\r\n",
      "questions and confined himself to other topics. At last she said she was\r\n",
      "afraid he had something to conceal; whereupon, after a pause, he asked\r\n",
      "her if she remembered recommending him, in the letter she had addressed\r\n",
      "him at Saint-Germain, to draw the sadness from her friend's smile. \"The\r\n",
      "last I saw of her was her smile,\" he said--\"when I bade her good-bye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I remember urging you to 'console' her,\" Mrs. Draper returned, \"and I\r\n",
      "wondered afterwards whether--model of discretion as you are--I hadn't\r\n",
      "cut you out work for which you wouldn't thank me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She has her consolation in herself,\" the young man said; \"she needs\r\n",
      "none that any one else can offer her. That's for troubles for which--be\r\n",
      "it more, be it less--our own folly has to answer. Madame de Mauves\r\n",
      "hasn't a grain of folly left.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah don't say that!\"--Mrs. Draper knowingly protested. \"Just a little\r\n",
      "folly's often very graceful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore rose to go--she somehow annoyed him. \"Don't talk of grace,\" he\r\n",
      "said, \"till you've measured her reason!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For two years after his return to America he heard nothing of Madame de\r\n",
      "Mauves. That he thought of her intently, constantly, I need hardly say;\r\n",
      "most people wondered why such a clever young man shouldn't \"devote\"\r\n",
      "himself to something; but to himself he seemed absorbingly occupied. He\r\n",
      "never wrote to her; he believed she wouldn't have \"liked\" it. At last he\r\n",
      "heard that Mrs. Draper had come home and he immediately called on her.\r\n",
      "\"Of course,\" she said after the first greetings, \"you're dying for news\r\n",
      "of Madame de Mauves. Prepare yourself for something strange. I heard\r\n",
      "from her two or three times during the year after your seeing her. She\r\n",
      "left Saint-Germain and went to live in the country on some old property\r\n",
      "of her husband's. She wrote me very kind little notes, but I felt\r\n",
      "somehow that--in spite of what you said about 'consolation'--they were\r\n",
      "the notes of a wretched woman. The only advice I could have given her\r\n",
      "was to leave her scamp of a husband and come back to her own land and\r\n",
      "her own people. But this I didn't feel free to do, and yet it made me\r\n",
      "so miserable not to be able to help her that I preferred to let our\r\n",
      "correspondence die a natural death. I had no news of her for a year.\r\n",
      "Last summer, however, I met at Vichy a clever young Frenchman whom\r\n",
      "I accidentally learned to be a friend of that charming sister of the\r\n",
      "Count's, Madame Clairin. I lost no time in asking him what he knew\r\n",
      "about Madame de Mauves--a countrywoman of mine and an old friend. 'I\r\n",
      "congratulate you on the friendship of such a person,' he answered.\r\n",
      "'That's the terrible little woman who killed her husband.' You may\r\n",
      "imagine I promptly asked for an explanation, and he told me--from his\r\n",
      "point of view--what he called the whole story. M. de Mauves had fait\r\n",
      "quelques folies which his wife had taken absurdly to heart. He had\r\n",
      "repented and asked her forgiveness, which she had inexorably refused.\r\n",
      "She was very pretty, and severity must have suited her style; for,\r\n",
      "whether or no her husband had been in love with her before, he fell\r\n",
      "madly in love with her now. He was the proudest man in France, but he\r\n",
      "had begged her on his knees to be re-admitted to favour. All in vain!\r\n",
      "She was stone, she was ice, she was outraged virtue. People noticed a\r\n",
      "great change in him; he gave up society, ceased to care for anything,\r\n",
      "looked shockingly. One fine day they discovered he had blown out his\r\n",
      "brains. My friend had the story of course from Madame Clairin.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Longmore was strongly moved, and his first impulse after he had\r\n",
      "recovered his composure was to return immediately to Europe. But several\r\n",

      "in the midst of all the ardent tenderness of his memory of Madame de\r\n",

      "\"I guess my daughter's in here,\" the old man said leading the way into\r\n",
      "the little salon de lecture. He was not of the most advanced age, but\r\n",
      "that is the way George Flack considered him, and indeed he looked older\r\n",
      "than he was. George Flack had found him sitting in the court of the\r\n",
      "hotel--he sat a great deal in the court of the hotel--and had gone up to\r\n",
      "him with characteristic directness and asked him for Miss Francina. Poor\r\n",
      "Mr. Dosson had with the greatest docility disposed himself to wait\r\n",
      "on the young man: he had as a matter of course risen and made his way\r\n",
      "across the court to announce to his child that she had a visitor. He\r\n",
      "looked submissive, almost servile, as he preceded the visitor, thrusting\r\n",
      "his head forward in his quest; but it was not in Mr. Flack's line to\r\n",
      "notice that sort of thing. He accepted the old gentleman's good offices\r\n",
      "as he would have accepted those of a waiter, conveying no hint of an\r\n",
      "attention paid also to himself. An observer of these two persons would\r\n",
      "have assured himself that the degree to which Mr. Dosson thought it\r\n",
      "natural any one should want to see his daughter was only equalled by the\r\n",
      "degree to which the young man thought it natural her father should take\r\n",
      "trouble to produce her. There was a superfluous drapery in the doorway\r\n",
      "of the salon de lecture, which Mr. Dosson pushed aside while George\r\n",
      "Flack stepped in after him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The reading-room of the Hotel de l'Univers et de Cheltenham was none\r\n",
      "too ample, and had seemed to Mr. Dosson from the first to consist\r\n",
      "principally of a highly-polished floor on the bareness of which it was\r\n",
      "easy for a relaxed elderly American to slip. It was composed further,\r\n",
      "to his perception, of a table with a green velvet cloth, of a fireplace\r\n",
      "with a great deal of fringe and no fire, of a window with a great deal\r\n",
      "of curtain and no light, and of the Figaro, which he couldn't read, and\r\n",
      "the New York Herald, which he had already read. A single person was just\r\n",
      "now in possession of these conveniences--a young lady who sat with her\r\n",
      "back to the window, looking straight before her into the conventional\r\n",
      "room. She was dressed as for the street; her empty hands rested upon the\r\n",
      "arms of her chair--she had withdrawn her long gloves, which were lying\r\n",
      "in her lap--and she seemed to be doing nothing as hard as she could. Her\r\n",
      "face was so much in shadow as to be barely distinguishable; nevertheless\r\n",
      "the young man had a disappointed cry as soon as he saw her. \"Why, it\r\n",
      "ain't Miss Francie--it's Miss Delia!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I guess we can fix that,\" said Mr. Dosson, wandering further\r\n",
      "into the room and drawing his feet over the floor without lifting\r\n",
      "them. Whatever he did he ever seemed to wander: he had an impermanent\r\n",
      "transitory air, an aspect of weary yet patient non-arrival, even when he\r\n",
      "sat, as he was capable of sitting for hours, in the court of the inn. As\r\n",
      "he glanced down at the two newspapers in their desert of green velvet\r\n",
      "he raised a hopeless uninterested glass to his eye. \"Delia dear, where's\r\n",
      "your little sister?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia made no movement whatever, nor did any expression, so far as could\r\n",
      "be perceived, pass over her large young face. She only ejaculated: \"Why,\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack, where did you drop from?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, this is a good place to meet,\" her father remarked, as if mildly,\r\n",
      "and as a mere passing suggestion, to deprecate explanations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Any place is good where one meets old friends,\" said George Flack,\r\n",
      "looking also at the newspapers. He examined the date of the American\r\n",
      "sheet and then put it down. \"Well, how do you like Paris?\" he\r\n",
      "subsequently went on to the young lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We quite enjoy it; but of course we're familiar now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I was in hopes I could show you something,\" Mr. Flack said.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, we've seen more than you!\" exclaimed his daughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I've seen a good deal--just sitting there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A person with delicate ear might have suspected Mr. Dosson of a tendency\r\n",
      "to \"setting\"; but he would pronounce the same word in a different manner\r\n",
      "at different times.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, in Paris you can see everything,\" said the young man. \"I'm quite\r\n",
      "enthusiastic about Paris.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Haven't you been here before?\" Miss Delia asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, but it's ever fresh. And how is Miss Francie?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's all right. She has gone upstairs to get something. I guess we're\r\n",
      "going out again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's very attractive for the young,\" Mr. Dosson pleaded to the visitor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, I'm one of the young. Do you mind if I go with you?\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Flack continued to the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It'll seem like old times, on the deck,\" she replied. \"We're going to\r\n",
      "the Bon Marche.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why don't you go to the Louvre? That's the place for YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We've just come from there: we've had quite a morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it's a good place,\" the visitor a trifle dryly opined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's good for some things but it doesn't come up to my idea for\r\n",
      "others.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh they've seen everything,\" said Mr. Dosson. Then he added: \"I guess\r\n",
      "I'll go and call Francie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, tell her to hurry,\" Miss Delia returned, swinging a glove in each\r\n",
      "hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She knows my pace,\" Mr. Flack remarked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should think she would, the way you raced!\" the girl returned with\r\n",
      "memories of the Umbria. \"I hope you don't expect to rush round Paris\r\n",
      "that way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I always rush. I live in a rush. That's the way to get through.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I AM through, I guess,\" said Mr. Dosson philosophically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I ain't!\" his daughter declared with decision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you must come round often,\" he continued to their friend as a\r\n",
      "leave-taking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I'll come round! I'll have to rush, but I'll do it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll send down Francie.\" And Francie's father crept away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And please give her some more money!\" her sister called after him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Does she keep the money?\" George Flack enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"I guess it's the first time you were ever called innocent!\" cried\r\n",
      "Delia, left alone with the visitor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I WAS--before I came to Paris.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I can't see that it has hurt US. We ain't a speck extravagant.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wouldn't you have a right to be?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think any one has a right to be,\" Miss Dosson returned\r\n",
      "incorruptibly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man, who had seated himself, looked at her a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's the way you used to talk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I haven't changed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And Miss Francie--has she?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you'll see,\" said Delia Dosson, beginning to draw on her gloves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion watched her, leaning forward with his elbows on the arms\r\n",
      "of his chair and his hands interlocked. At last he said interrogatively:\r\n",
      "\"Bon Marche?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I got them in a little place I know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, they're Paris anyway.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course they're Paris. But you can get gloves anywhere.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must show me the little place anyhow,\" Mr. Flack continued\r\n",
      "sociably. And he observed further and with the same friendliness: \"The\r\n",
      "old gentleman seems all there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh he's the dearest of the dear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's a real gentleman--of the old stamp,\" said George Flack.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what should you think our father would be?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should think he'd be delighted!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, he is, when we carry out our plans.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what are they--your plans?\" asked the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I never tell them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How then does he know whether you carry them out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I guess he'd know it if we didn't,\" said the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I remember how secretive you were last year. You kept everything to\r\n",
      "yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I know what I want,\" the young lady pursued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He watched her button one of her gloves deftly, using a hairpin released\r\n",
      "from some mysterious office under her bonnet. There was a moment's\r\n",
      "silence, after which they looked up at each other. \"I've an idea you\r\n",
      "don't want me,\" said George Flack.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I do--as a friend.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of all the mean ways of trying to get rid of a man that's the meanest!\"\r\n",
      "he rang out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where's the meanness when I suppose you're not so ridiculous as to wish\r\n",
      "to be anything more!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"More to your sister, do you mean--or to yourself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My sister IS myself--I haven't got any other,\" said Delia Dosson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Any other sister?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be idiotic. Are you still in the same business?\" the girl went\r\n",
      "on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I forget which one I WAS in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, something to do with that newspaper--don't you remember?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but it isn't that paper any more--it's a different one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you go round for news--in the same way?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I try to get the people what they want. It's hard work,\" said the\r\n",
      "young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I suppose if you didn't some one else would. They will have it,\r\n",
      "won't they?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, they will have it.\" The wants of the people, however, appeared at\r\n",
      "the present moment to interest Mr. Flack less than his own. He looked at\r\n",
      "his watch and remarked that the old gentleman didn't seem to have much\r\n",
      "authority.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\" the girl asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why with Miss Francie. She's taking her time, or rather, I mean, she's\r\n",
      "taking mine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if you expect to do anything with her you must give her plenty of\r\n",
      "that,\" Delia returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right: I'll give her all I have.\" And Miss Dosson's interlocutor\r\n",
      "leaned back in his chair with folded arms, as to signify how much, if\r\n",
      "it came to that, she might have to count with his patience. But she sat\r\n",
      "there easy and empty, giving no sign and fearing no future. He was the\r\n",
      "first indeed to turn again to restlessness: at the end of a few moments\r\n",
      "he asked the young lady if she didn't suppose her father had told her\r\n",
      "sister who it was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you think that's all that's required?\" she made answer with cold\r\n",
      "gaiety. But she added more familiarly: \"Probably that's the reason.\r\n",
      "She's so shy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--she used to look it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, that's her peculiarity, that she never looks it and yet suffers\r\n",
      "everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you make it up for her then, Miss Delia,\" the young man ventured\r\n",
      "to declare. \"You don't suffer much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, for Francie I'm all there. I guess I could act for her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had a pause. \"You act for her too much. If it wasn't for you I think\r\n",
      "I could do something.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you've got to kill me first!\" Delia Dosson replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll come down on you somehow in the Reverberator\" he went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the threat left her calm. \"Oh that's not what the people want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, unfortunately they don't care anything about MY affairs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, we do: we're kinder than most, Francie and I,\" said the girl.\r\n",
      "\"But we desire to keep your affairs quite distinct from ours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh your--yours: if I could only discover what they are!\" cried George\r\n",
      "Flack. And during the rest of the time that they waited the young\r\n",
      "journalist tried to find out. If an observer had chanced to be present\r\n",
      "for the quarter of an hour that elapsed, and had had any attention to\r\n",
      "give to these vulgar young persons, he would have wondered perhaps at\r\n",
      "there being so much mystery on one side and so much curiosity on the\r\n",
      "other--wondered at least at the elaboration of inscrutable projects on\r\n",
      "the part of a girl who looked to the casual eye as if she were stolidly\r\n",
      "passive. Fidelia Dosson, whose name had been shortened, was twenty-five\r\n",
      "years old and had a large white face, in which the eyes were far apart.\r\n",
      "Her forehead was high but her mouth was small, her hair was light and\r\n",
      "colourless and a certain inelegant thickness of figure made her appear\r\n",
      "shorter than she was. Elegance indeed had not been her natural portion,\r\n",
      "and the Bon Marche and other establishments had to make up for that. To\r\n",
      "a casual sister's eye they would scarce have appeared to have acquitted\r\n",
      "themselves of their office, but even a woman wouldn't have guessed how\r\n",
      "little Fidelia cared. She always looked the same; all the contrivances\r\n",
      "of Paris couldn't fill out that blank, and she held them, for herself,\r\n",
      "in no manner of esteem. It was a plain clean round pattern face, marked\r\n",
      "for recognition among so many only perhaps by a small figure, the sprig\r\n",
      "on a china plate, that might have denoted deep obstinacy; and yet, with\r\n",
      "its settled smoothness, it was neither stupid nor hard. It was as\r\n",
      "calm as a room kept dusted and aired for candid earnest occasions,\r\n",
      "the meeting of unanimous committees and the discussion of flourishing\r\n",
      "businesses. If she had been a young man--and she had a little the head\r\n",
      "of one--it would probably have been thought of her that she was likely\r\n",
      "to become a Doctor or a Judge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An observer would have gathered, further, that Mr. Flack's acquaintance\r\n",
      "with Mr. Dosson and his daughters had had its origin in his crossing the\r\n",
      "Atlantic eastward in their company more than a year before, and in some\r\n",
      "slight association immediately after disembarking, but that each party\r\n",
      "had come and gone a good deal since then--come and gone however without\r\n",
      "meeting again. It was to be inferred that in this interval Miss Dosson\r\n",
      "had led her father and sister back to their native land and had then a\r\n",
      "second time directed their course to Europe. This was a new departure,\r\n",
      "said Mr. Flack, or rather a new arrival: he understood that it\r\n",
      "wasn't, as he called it, the same old visit. She didn't repudiate\r\n",
      "the accusation, launched by her companion as if it might have been\r\n",
      "embarrassing, of having spent her time at home in Boston, and even in a\r\n",
      "suburban quarter of it: she confessed that as Bostonians they had been\r\n",
      "capable of that. But now they had come abroad for longer--ever so much:\r\n",
      "what they had gone home for was to make arrangements for a European\r\n",
      "stay of which the limits were not to be told. So far as this particular\r\n",
      "future opened out to her she freely acknowledged it. It appeared to meet\r\n",
      "with George Flack's approval--he also had a big undertaking on that side\r\n",
      "and it might require years, so that it would be pleasant to have his\r\n",
      "friends right there. He knew his way round in Paris--or any place like\r\n",
      "that--much better than round Boston; if they had been poked away in one\r\n",
      "of those clever suburbs they would have been lost to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, well, you'll see as much as you want of us--the way you'll have to\r\n",
      "take us,\" Delia Dosson said: which led the young man to ask which\r\n",
      "that way was and to guess he had never known but one way to take\r\n",
      "anything--which was just as it came. \"Oh well, you'll see what you'll\r\n",
      "make of it,\" the girl returned; and she would give for the present no\r\n",
      "further explanation of her somewhat chilling speech. In spite if\r\n",
      "it however she professed an interest in Mr. Flack's announced\r\n",
      "undertaking--an interest springing apparently from an interest in the\r\n",
      "personage himself. The man of wonderments and measurements we have\r\n",
      "smuggled into the scene would have gathered that Miss Dosson's attention\r\n",
      "was founded on a conception of Mr. Flack's intrinsic brilliancy. Would\r\n",
      "his own impression have justified that?--would he have found such a\r\n",
      "conception contagious? I forbear to ridicule the thought, for that would\r\n",
      "saddle me with the care of showing what right our officious observer\r\n",
      "might have had to his particular standard. Let us therefore simply\r\n",
      "note that George Flack had grounds for looming publicly large to\r\n",
      "an uninformed young woman. He was connected, as she supposed, with\r\n",
      "literature, and wasn't a sympathy with literature one of the many\r\n",
      "engaging attributes of her so generally attractive little sister? If\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack was a writer Francie was a reader: hadn't a trail of forgotten\r\n",
      "Tauchnitzes marked the former line of travel of the party of three? The\r\n",
      "elder girl grabbed at them on leaving hotels and railway-carriages, but\r\n",
      "usually found that she had brought odd volumes. She considered\r\n",
      "however that as a family they had an intellectual link with the young\r\n",
      "journalist, and would have been surprised if she had heard the advantage\r\n",
      "of his acquaintance questioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack's appearance was not so much a property of his own as a\r\n",
      "prejudice or a fixed liability of those who looked at him: whoever they\r\n",
      "might be what they saw mainly in him was that they had seen him before.\r\n",
      "And, oddly enough, this recognition carried with it in general no\r\n",
      "ability to remember--that is to recall--him: you couldn't conveniently\r\n",
      "have prefigured him, and it was only when you were conscious of him that\r\n",
      "you knew you had already somehow paid for it. To carry him in your mind\r\n",
      "you must have liked him very much, for no other sentiment, not even\r\n",
      "aversion, would have taught you what distinguished him in his group:\r\n",
      "aversion in especial would have made you aware only of what confounded\r\n",
      "him. He was not a specific person, but had beyond even Delia Dosson,\r\n",
      "in whom we have facially noted it, the quality of the sample or\r\n",
      "advertisement, the air of representing a \"line of goods\" for which there\r\n",
      "is a steady popular demand. You would scarce have expected him to be\r\n",
      "individually designated: a number, like that of the day's newspaper,\r\n",
      "would have served all his, or at least all your purpose, and you would\r\n",
      "have vaguely supposed the number high--somewhere up in the millions. As\r\n",
      "every copy of the newspaper answers to its name, Miss Dosson's visitor\r\n",
      "would have been quite adequately marked as \"young commercial American.\"\r\n",
      "Let me add that among the accidents of his appearance was that of its\r\n",
      "sometimes striking other young commercial Americans as fine. He was\r\n",
      "twenty-seven years old and had a small square head, a light grey\r\n",
      "overcoat and in his right forefinger a curious natural crook which might\r\n",
      "have availed, under pressure, to identify him. But for the convenience\r\n",
      "of society he ought always to have worn something conspicuous--a green\r\n",
      "hat or a yellow necktie. His undertaking was to obtain material in\r\n",
      "Europe for an American \"society-paper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If it be objected to all this that when Francie Dosson at last came in\r\n",
      "she addressed him as if she easily placed him, the answer is that she\r\n",
      "had been notified by her father--and more punctually than was indicated\r\n",
      "by the manner of her response. \"Well, the way you DO turn up,\" she said,\r\n",
      "smiling and holding out her left hand to him: in the other hand, or the\r\n",
      "hollow of her slim right arm, she had a lumpish parcel. Though she had\r\n",
      "made him wait she was clearly very glad to see him there; and she as\r\n",
      "evidently required and enjoyed a great deal of that sort of indulgence.\r\n",
      "Her sister's attitude would have told you so even if her own appearance\r\n",
      "had not. There was that in her manner to the young man--a perceptible\r\n",
      "but indefinable shade--which seemed to legitimate the oddity of his\r\n",
      "having asked in particular for her, asked as if he wished to see her to\r\n",
      "the exclusion of her father and sister: the note of a special pleasure\r\n",
      "which might have implied a special relation. And yet a spectator looking\r\n",
      "from Mr. George Flack to Miss Francie Dosson would have been much at a\r\n",
      "loss to guess what special relation could exist between them. The girl\r\n",
      "was exceedingly, extraordinarily pretty, all exempt from traceable\r\n",
      "likeness to her sister; and there was a brightness in her--a still\r\n",
      "and scattered radiance--which was quite distinct from what is called\r\n",
      "animation. Rather tall than short, fine slender erect, with an airy\r\n",
      "lightness of hand and foot, she yet gave no impression of quick\r\n",
      "movement, of abundant chatter, of excitable nerves and irrepressible\r\n",
      "life--no hint of arriving at her typical American grace in the most\r\n",
      "usual way. She was pretty without emphasis and as might almost have been\r\n",
      "said without point, and your fancy that a little stiffness would have\r\n",
      "improved her was at once qualified by the question of what her softness\r\n",
      "would have made of it. There was nothing in her, however, to confirm\r\n",
      "the implication that she had rushed about the deck of a Cunarder with a\r\n",
      "newspaper-man. She was as straight as a wand and as true as a gem; her\r\n",
      "neck was long and her grey eyes had colour; and from the ripple of her\r\n",
      "dark brown hair to the curve of her unaffirmative chin every line in\r\n",
      "her face was happy and pure. She had a weak pipe of a voice and\r\n",
      "inconceivabilities of ignorance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia got up, and they came out of the little reading-room--this young\r\n",
      "lady remarking to her sister that she hoped she had brought down all\r\n",
      "the things. \"Well, I had a fiendish hunt for them--we've got so many,\"\r\n",
      "Francie replied with a strange want of articulation. \"There were a few\r\n",
      "dozens of the pocket-handkerchiefs I couldn't find; but I guess I've got\r\n",
      "most of them and most of the gloves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what are you carting them about for?\" George Flack enquired,\r\n",
      "taking the parcel from her. \"You had better let me handle them. Do you\r\n",
      "buy pocket-handkerchiefs by the hundred?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it only makes fifty apiece,\" Francie yieldingly smiled. \"They\r\n",
      "ain't really nice--we're going to change them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I won't be mixed up with that--you can't work that game on these\r\n",
      "Frenchmen!\" the young man stated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh with Francie they'll take anything back,\" Delia Dosson declared.\r\n",
      "\"They just love her, all over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, they're like me then,\" said Mr. Flack with friendly cheer. \"I'LL\r\n",
      "take her back if she'll come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I don't think I'm ready quite yet,\" the girl replied. \"But I hope\r\n",
      "very much we shall cross with you again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Talk about crossing--it's on these boulevards we want a\r\n",
      "life-preserver!\" Delia loudly commented. They had passed out of the\r\n",
      "hotel and the wide vista of the Rue de la Paix stretched up and down.\r\n",
      "There were many vehicles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Won't this thing do? I'll tie it to either of you,\" George Flack said,\r\n",
      "holding out his bundle. \"I suppose they won't kill you if they love\r\n",
      "you,\" he went on to the object of his preference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you've got to know me first,\" she answered, laughing and looking\r\n",
      "for a chance, while they waited to pass over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I didn't know you when I was struck.\" He applied his disengaged hand to\r\n",
      "her elbow and propelled her across the street. She took no notice of\r\n",
      "his observation, and Delia asked her, on the other side, whether their\r\n",
      "father had given her that money. She replied that he had given her\r\n",
      "loads--she felt as if he had made his will; which led George Flack to\r\n",
      "say that he wished the old gentleman was HIS father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why you don't mean to say you want to be our brother!\" Francie prattled\r\n",
      "as they went down the Rue de la Paix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should like to be Miss Delia's, if you can make that out,\" he\r\n",
      "laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then suppose you prove it by calling me a cab,\" Miss\r\n",
      "Delia returned. \"I presume you and Francie don't take this for a\r\n",
      "promenade-deck.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't she feel rich?\" George Flack demanded of Francie. \"But we do\r\n",
      "require a cart for our goods\"; and he hailed a little yellow carriage,\r\n",
      "which presently drew up beside the pavement. The three got into it and,\r\n",
      "still emitting innocent pleasantries, proceeded on their way, while at\r\n",
      "the Hotel de l'Univers et de Cheltenham Mr. Dosson wandered down into\r\n",
      "the court again and took his place in his customary chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The court was roofed with glass; the April air was mild; the cry of\r\n",
      "women selling violets came in from the street and, mingling with the\r\n",
      "rich hum of Paris, seemed to bring with it faintly the odour of the\r\n",
      "flowers. There were other odours in the place, warm succulent and\r\n",
      "Parisian, which ranged from fried fish to burnt sugar; and there were\r\n",
      "many things besides: little tables for the post-prandial coffee; piles\r\n",
      "of luggage inscribed (after the initials or frequently the name) R.\r\n",
      "P. Scudamore or D. Jackson Hodge, Philadelphia Pa., or St. Louis\r\n",
      "Mo.; rattles of unregarded bells, flittings of tray-bearing waiters,\r\n",
      "conversations with the second-floor windows of admonitory landladies,\r\n",
      "arrivals of young women with coffinlike bandboxes covered with black\r\n",
      "oil-cloth and depending from a strap, sallyings-forth of persons staying\r\n",
      "and arrivals just afterwards of other persons to see them; together with\r\n",
      "vague prostrations on benches of tired heads of American families.\r\n",
      "It was to this last element that Mr. Dosson himself in some degree\r\n",
      "contributed, but it must be added that he had not the extremely bereft\r\n",
      "and exhausted appearance of certain of his fellows. There was an air of\r\n",
      "ruminant resignation, of habitual accommodation in him; but you would\r\n",
      "have guessed that he was enjoying a holiday rather than aching for a\r\n",
      "truce, and he was not so enfeebled but that he was able to get up from\r\n",
      "time to time and stroll through the porte cochere to have a look at the\r\n",
      "street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gazed up and down for five minutes with his hands in his pockets, and\r\n",
      "then came back; that appeared to content him; he asked for little and\r\n",
      "had no restlessness that these small excursions wouldn't assuage. He\r\n",
      "looked at the heaped-up luggage, at the tinkling bells, at the young\r\n",
      "women from the lingere, at the repudiated visitors, at everything but\r\n",
      "the other American parents. Something in his breast told him that he\r\n",
      "knew all about these. It's not upon each other that the animals in the\r\n",
      "same cage, in a zoological collection, most turn their eyes. There was\r\n",
      "a silent sociability in him and a superficial fineness of grain that\r\n",
      "helped to account for his daughter Francie's various delicacies. He was\r\n",
      "fair and spare and had no figure; you would have seen in a moment\r\n",
      "that the question of how he should hold himself had never in his life\r\n",
      "occurred to him. He never held himself at all; providence held him\r\n",
      "rather--and very loosely--by an invisible string at the end of which he\r\n",
      "seemed gently to dangle and waver. His face was so smooth that his thin\r\n",
      "light whiskers, which grew only far back, scarcely seemed native to his\r\n",
      "cheeks: they might have been attached there for some harmless purpose of\r\n",
      "comedy or disguise. He looked for the most part as if he were thinking\r\n",
      "over, without exactly understanding it, something rather droll that had\r\n",
      "just occurred; if his eyes wandered his attention rested, just as\r\n",
      "it hurried, quite as little. His feet were remarkably small, and his\r\n",
      "clothes, in which light colours predominated, were visibly the work of\r\n",
      "a French tailor: he was an American who still held the tradition that it\r\n",
      "is in Paris a man dresses himself best. His hat would have looked odd in\r\n",
      "Bond Street or the Fifth Avenue, and his necktie was loose and flowing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dosson, it may further be noted, was a person of the simplest\r\n",
      "composition, a character as cipherable as a sum of two figures. He had\r\n",
      "a native financial faculty of the finest order, a gift as direct as\r\n",
      "a beautiful tenor voice, which had enabled him, without the aid of\r\n",
      "particular strength of will or keenness of ambition, to build up a large\r\n",
      "fortune while he was still of middle age. He had a genius for happy\r\n",
      "speculation, the quick unerring instinct of a \"good thing\"; and as he\r\n",
      "sat there idle amused contented, on the edge of the Parisian street,\r\n",
      "he might very well have passed for some rare performer who had sung his\r\n",
      "song or played his trick and had nothing to do till the next call.\r\n",
      "And he had grown rich not because he was ravenous or hard, but simply\r\n",
      "because he had an ear, not to term it a nose. He could make out the tune\r\n",
      "in the discord of the market-place; he could smell success far up\r\n",
      "the wind. The second factor in his little addition was that he was an\r\n",
      "unassuming father. He had no tastes, no acquirements, no curiosities,\r\n",
      "and his daughters represented all society for him. He thought much\r\n",
      "more and much oftener of these young ladies than of his bank-shares and\r\n",
      "railway-stock; they crowned much more his sense of accumulated property.\r\n",
      "He never compared them with other girls; he only compared his present\r\n",
      "self with what he would have been without them. His view of them was\r\n",
      "perfectly simple. Delia had a greater direct knowledge of life and\r\n",
      "Francie a wider acquaintance with literature and art. Mr. Dosson had\r\n",
      "not perhaps a full perception of his younger daughter's beauty: he\r\n",
      "would scarcely have pretended to judge of that, more than he would of a\r\n",
      "valuable picture or vase, but he believed she was cultivated up to the\r\n",
      "eyes. He had a recollection of tremendous school-bills and, in later\r\n",
      "days, during their travels, of the way she was always leaving books\r\n",
      "behind her. Moreover wasn't her French so good that he couldn't\r\n",
      "understand it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two girls, at any rate, formed the breeze in his sail and the only\r\n",
      "directing determinant force he knew; when anything happened--and he was\r\n",
      "under the impression that things DID happen--they were there for it to\r\n",
      "have happened TO. Without them in short, as he felt, he would have been\r\n",
      "the tail without the kite. The wind rose and fell of course; there were\r\n",
      "lulls and there were gales; there were intervals during which he simply\r\n",
      "floated in quiet waters--cast anchor and waited. This appeared to be one\r\n",
      "of them now; but he could be patient, knowing that he should soon again\r\n",
      "inhale the brine and feel the dip of his prow. When his daughters were\r\n",
      "out for any time the occasion affected him as a \"weather-breeder\"--the\r\n",
      "wind would be then, as a kind of consequence, GOING to rise; but their\r\n",
      "now being out with a remarkably bright young man only sweetened the\r\n",
      "temporary calm. That belonged to their superior life, and Mr. Dosson\r\n",
      "never doubted that George M. Flack was remarkably bright. He represented\r\n",
      "the newspaper, and the newspaper for this man of genial assumptions\r\n",
      "represented--well, all other representations whatever. To know Delia and\r\n",
      "Francie thus attended by an editor or a correspondent was really to see\r\n",
      "them dancing in the central glow. This is doubtless why Mr. Dosson had\r\n",
      "slightly more than usual his air of recovering slowly from a pleasant\r\n",
      "surprise. The vision to which I allude hung before him, at a convenient\r\n",
      "distance, and melted into other bright confused aspects: reminiscences\r\n",
      "of Mr. Flack in other relations--on the ship, on the deck, at the hotel\r\n",
      "at Liverpool, and in the cars. Whitney Dosson was a loyal father, but\r\n",
      "he would have thought himself simple had he not had two or three strong\r\n",
      "convictions: one of which was that the children should never go out with\r\n",
      "a gentleman they hadn't seen before. The sense of their having, and his\r\n",
      "having, seen Mr. Flack before was comfortable to him now: it made mere\r\n",
      "placidity of his personally foregoing the young man's society in favour\r\n",
      "of Delia and Francie. He had not hitherto been perfectly satisfied that\r\n",
      "the streets and shops, the general immensity of Paris, were just the\r\n",
      "safest place for young ladies alone. But the company of a helpful\r\n",
      "gentleman ensured safety--a gentleman who would be helpful by the fact\r\n",
      "of his knowing so much and having it all right there. If a big newspaper\r\n",
      "told you everything there was in the world every morning, that was\r\n",
      "what a big newspaper-man would have to know, and Mr. Dosson had never\r\n",
      "supposed there was anything left to know when such voices as Mr. Flack's\r\n",
      "and that of his organ had daily been heard. In the absence of such happy\r\n",
      "chances--and in one way or another they kept occurring--his girls might\r\n",
      "have seemed lonely, which was not the way he struck himself. They were\r\n",
      "his company but he scarcely theirs; it was as if they belonged to him\r\n",
      "more than he to them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were out a long time, but he felt no anxiety, as he reflected that\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack's very profession would somehow make everything turn out to\r\n",
      "their profit. The bright French afternoon waned without bringing them\r\n",
      "back, yet Mr. Dosson still revolved about the court till he might have\r\n",
      "been taken for a valet de place hoping to pick up custom. The landlady\r\n",
      "smiled at him sometimes as she passed and re-passed, and even ventured\r\n",
      "to remark disinterestedly that it was a pity to waste such a lovely day\r\n",
      "indoors--not to take a turn and see what was going on in Paris. But Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson had no sense of waste: that came to him much more when he was\r\n",
      "confronted with historical monuments or beauties of nature or art, which\r\n",
      "affected him as the talk of people naming others, naming friends of\r\n",
      "theirs, whom he had never heard of: then he was aware of a degree of\r\n",
      "waste for the others, as if somebody lost something--but never when he\r\n",
      "lounged in that simplifying yet so comprehensive way in the court. It\r\n",
      "wanted but a quarter of an hour to dinner--THAT historic fact was not\r\n",
      "beyond his measure--when Delia and Francie at last met his view, still\r\n",
      "accompanied by Mr. Flack and sauntering in, at a little distance from\r\n",
      "each other, with a jaded air which was not in the least a tribute to his\r\n",
      "possible solicitude. They dropped into chairs and joked with each other,\r\n",
      "mingling sociability and languor, on the subject of what they had\r\n",
      "seen and done--a question into which he felt as yet the delicacy of\r\n",
      "enquiring. But they had evidently done a good deal and had a good\r\n",
      "time: an impression sufficient to rescue Mr. Dosson personally from the\r\n",
      "consciousness of failure. \"Won't you just step in and take dinner with\r\n",
      "us?\" he asked of the young man with a friendliness to which everything\r\n",
      "appeared to minister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that's a handsome offer,\" George Flack replied while Delia put it\r\n",
      "on record that they had each eaten about thirty cakes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I wondered what you were doing so long. But never mind your\r\n",
      "cakes. It's twenty minutes past six, and the table d'hote's on time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say you dine at the table d'hote!\" Mr. Flack cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, don't you like that?\"--and Francie's candour of appeal to their\r\n",
      "comrade's taste was celestial.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it isn't what you must build on when you come to Paris. Too many\r\n",
      "flowerpots and chickens' legs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, would you like one of these restaurants?\" asked Mr. Dosson. \"_I_\r\n",
      "don't care--if you show us a good one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'll show you a good one--don't you worry.\" Mr. Flack's tone was\r\n",
      "ever that of keeping the poor gentleman mildly but firmly in his place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you've got to order the dinner then,\" said Francie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you'll see how I could do it!\" He towered over her in the pride\r\n",
      "of this feat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has got an interest in some place,\" Delia declared. \"He has taken us\r\n",
      "to ever so many stores where he gets his commission.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'd pay you to take them round,\" said Mr. Dosson; and with much\r\n",
      "agreeable trifling of this kind it was agreed that they should sally\r\n",
      "forth for the evening meal under Mr. Flack's guidance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If he had easily convinced them on this occasion that that was a more\r\n",
      "original proceeding than worrying those old bones, as he called it, at\r\n",
      "the hotel, he convinced them of other things besides in the course of\r\n",
      "the following month and by the aid of profuse attentions. What he mainly\r\n",
      "made clear to them was that it was really most kind of a young man who\r\n",
      "had so many big things on his mind to find sympathy for questions, for\r\n",
      "issues, he used to call them, that could occupy the telegraph and the\r\n",
      "press so little as theirs. He came every day to set them in the right\r\n",
      "path, pointing out its charms to them in a way that made them feel how\r\n",
      "much they had been in the wrong. It made them feel indeed that they\r\n",
      "didn't know anything about anything, even about such a matter as\r\n",
      "ordering shoes--an art in which they had vaguely supposed themselves\r\n",
      "rather strong. He had in fact great knowledge, which was wonderfully\r\n",
      "various, and he knew as many people as they knew few. He had\r\n",
      "appointments--very often with celebrities--for every hour of the day,\r\n",
      "and memoranda, sometimes in shorthand, on tablets with elastic straps,\r\n",
      "with which he dazzled the simple folk at the Hotel de l'Univers et de\r\n",
      "Cheltenham, whose social life, of narrow range, consisted mainly in\r\n",
      "reading the lists of Americans who \"registered\" at the bankers' and at\r\n",
      "Galignani's. Delia Dosson in particular had a trick of poring solemnly\r\n",
      "over these records which exasperated Mr. Flack, who skimmed them and\r\n",
      "found what he wanted in the flash of an eye: she kept the others waiting\r\n",
      "while she satisfied herself that Mr. and Mrs. D. S. Rosenheim and Miss\r\n",
      "Cora Rosenheim and Master Samuel Rosenheim had \"left for Brussels.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack was wonderful on all occasions in finding what he\r\n",
      "wanted--which, as we know, was what he believed the public wanted--and\r\n",
      "Delia was the only one of the party with whom he was sometimes a little\r\n",
      "sharp. He had embraced from the first the idea that she was his enemy,\r\n",
      "and he alluded to it with almost tiresome frequency, though always in a\r\n",
      "humorous fearless strain. Even more than by her fashion of hanging over\r\n",
      "the registers she provoked him by appearing to find their little party\r\n",
      "not sufficient to itself, by wishing, as he expressed it, to work in new\r\n",
      "stuff. He might have been easy, however, for he had sufficient chance to\r\n",
      "observe how it was always the fate of the Dossons to miss their friends.\r\n",
      "They were continually looking out for reunions and combinations that\r\n",
      "never came off, hearing that people had been in Paris only after they\r\n",
      "had gone away, or feeling convinced that they were there but not to be\r\n",
      "found through their not having registered, or wondering whether they\r\n",
      "should overtake them if they should go to Dresden, and then making up\r\n",
      "their minds to start for Dresden only to learn at the eleventh hour,\r\n",
      "through some accident, that the hunted game had \"left for\" Biarritz even\r\n",
      "as the Rosenheims for Brussels. \"We know plenty of people if we could\r\n",
      "only come across them,\" Delia had more than once observed: she\r\n",
      "scanned the Continent with a wondering baffled gaze and talked of the\r\n",
      "unsatisfactory way in which friends at home would \"write out\" that other\r\n",
      "friends were \"somewhere in Europe.\" She expressed the wish that such\r\n",
      "correspondents as that might be in a place that was not at all vague.\r\n",
      "Two or three times people had called at the hotel when they were out and\r\n",
      "had left cards for them without an address and superscribed with some\r\n",
      "mocking dash of the pencil--\"So sorry to miss you!\" or \"Off to-morrow!\"\r\n",
      "The girl sat looking at these cards, handling them and turning them over\r\n",
      "for a quarter of an hour at a time; she produced them days afterwards,\r\n",
      "brooding upon them afresh as if they were a mystic clue. George Flack\r\n",
      "generally knew where they were, the people who were \"somewhere in\r\n",
      "Europe.\" Such knowledge came to him by a kind of intuition, by the\r\n",
      "voices of the air, by indefinable and unteachable processes. But he held\r\n",
      "his peace on purpose; he didn't want any outsiders; he thought their\r\n",
      "little party just right. Mr. Dosson's place in the scheme of Providence\r\n",
      "was to \"go\" with Delia while he himself \"went\" with Francie, and nothing\r\n",
      "would have induced George Flack to disfigure that equation. The young\r\n",
      "man was professionally so occupied with other people's affairs that it\r\n",
      "should doubtless be mentioned to his praise that he still managed to\r\n",
      "have affairs--or at least an affair--of his own. That affair was Francie\r\n",
      "Dosson, and he was pleased to perceive how little SHE cared what had\r\n",
      "become of Mr. and Mrs. Rosenheim and Master Samuel and Miss Cora. He\r\n",
      "counted all the things she didn't care about--her soft inadvertent eyes\r\n",
      "helped him to do that; and they footed up so, as he would have said,\r\n",
      "that they gave him the rich sense of a free field. If she had so few\r\n",
      "interests there was the greater possibility that a young man of bold\r\n",
      "conceptions and cheerful manners might become one. She had usually the\r\n",
      "air of waiting for something, with a pretty listlessness or an amused\r\n",
      "resignation, while tender shy indefinite little fancies hummed in her\r\n",
      "brain. Thus she would perhaps recognise in him the reward of patience.\r\n",
      "George Flack was aware that he exposed his friends to considerable\r\n",
      "fatigue: he brought them back pale and taciturn from suburban excursions\r\n",
      "and from wanderings often rather aimless and casual among the boulevards\r\n",
      "and avenues of the town. He regarded them at such times with complacency\r\n",
      "however, for these were hours of diminished resistance: he had an idea\r\n",
      "that he should be able eventually to circumvent Delia if he only could\r\n",
      "catch her some day sufficiently, that is physically, prostrate. He liked\r\n",
      "to make them all feel helpless and dependent, and this was not difficult\r\n",
      "with people who were so modest and artless, so unconscious of the\r\n",
      "boundless power of wealth. Sentiment, in our young man, was not a\r\n",
      "scruple nor a source of weakness; but he thought it really touching, the\r\n",
      "little these good people knew of what they could do with their money.\r\n",
      "They had in their hands a weapon of infinite range and yet were\r\n",
      "incapable of firing a shot for themselves. They had a sort of social\r\n",
      "humility; it appeared never to have occurred to them that, added to\r\n",
      "their loveliness, their money gave them a value. This used to strike\r\n",
      "George Flack on certain occasions when he came back to find them in the\r\n",
      "places where he had dropped them while he rushed off to give a turn\r\n",
      "to one of his screws. They never played him false, never wearied of\r\n",
      "waiting; always sat patient and submissive, usually at a cafe to which\r\n",
      "he had introduced them or in a row of chairs on the boulevard, on the\r\n",
      "level expanse of the Tuileries or in the Champs Elysees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He introduced them to many cafes, in different parts of Paris, being\r\n",
      "careful to choose those which in his view young ladies might frequent\r\n",
      "with propriety, and there were two or three in the neighbourhood of\r\n",
      "their hotel where they became frequent and familiar figures. As the\r\n",
      "late spring days grew warmer and brighter they mainly camped out on\r\n",
      "the \"terrace,\" amid the array of small tables at the door of the\r\n",
      "establishment, where Mr. Flack, on the return, could descry them\r\n",
      "from afar at their post and in the very same postures to which he\r\n",
      "had appointed them. They complained of no satiety in watching the\r\n",
      "many-coloured movement of the Parisian streets; and if some of the\r\n",
      "features in the panorama were base they were only so in a version that\r\n",
      "the social culture of our friends was incapable of supplying. George\r\n",
      "Flack considered that he was rendering a positive service to Mr. Dosson:\r\n",
      "wouldn't the old gentleman have sat all day in the court anyway? and\r\n",
      "wasn't the boulevard better than the court? It was his theory too that\r\n",
      "he nattered and caressed Miss Francie's father, for there was no one\r\n",
      "to whom he had furnished more copious details about the affairs, the\r\n",
      "projects and prospects, of the Reverberator. He had left no doubt in the\r\n",
      "old gentleman's mind as to the race he himself intended to run, and Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson used to say to him every day, the first thing, \"Well, where have\r\n",
      "you got to now?\"--quite as if he took a real interest. George Flack\r\n",
      "reported his interviews, that is his reportings, to which Delia and\r\n",
      "Francie gave attention only in case they knew something of the persons\r\n",
      "on whom the young emissary of the Reverberator had conferred\r\n",
      "this distinction; whereas Mr. Dosson listened, with his tolerant\r\n",
      "interposition of \"Is that so?\" and \"Well, that's good,\" just as\r\n",
      "submissively when he heard of the celebrity in question for the first\r\n",
      "time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conversation with his daughters Mr. Flack was frequently the theme,\r\n",
      "though introduced much more by the young ladies than by himself, and\r\n",
      "especially by Delia, who announced at an early period that she knew what\r\n",
      "he wanted and that it wasn't in the least what SHE wanted. She amplified\r\n",
      "this statement very soon--at least as regards her interpretation of Mr.\r\n",
      "Flack's designs: a certain mystery still hung about her own, which, as\r\n",
      "she intimated, had much more to recommend them. Delia's vision of the\r\n",
      "danger as well as the advantage of being a pretty girl was closely\r\n",
      "connected, as was natural, with the idea of an \"engagement\": this idea\r\n",
      "was in a manner complete in itself--her imagination failed in the oddest\r\n",
      "way to carry it into the next stage. She wanted her sister to be engaged\r\n",
      "but wanted her not at all to be married, and had clearly never made up\r\n",
      "her mind as to how Francie was to enjoy both the peril and the shelter.\r\n",
      "It was a secret source of humiliation to her that there had as yet to\r\n",
      "her knowledge been no one with whom her sister had exchanged vows; if\r\n",
      "her conviction on this subject could have expressed itself intelligibly\r\n",
      "it would have given you a glimpse of a droll state of mind--a dim theory\r\n",
      "that a bright girl ought to be able to try successive aspirants. Delia's\r\n",
      "conception of what such a trial might consist of was strangely innocent:\r\n",
      "it was made up of calls and walks and buggy-drives, and above all of\r\n",
      "being, in the light of these exhibitions, the theme of tongues and\r\n",
      "subject to the great imputation. It had never in life occurred to\r\n",
      "her withal that a succession of lovers, or just even a repetition of\r\n",
      "experiments, may have anything to say to a young lady's delicacy. She\r\n",
      "felt herself a born old maid and never dreamed of a lover of her own--he\r\n",
      "would have been dreadfully in her way; but she dreamed of love\r\n",
      "as something in its nature essentially refined. All the same she\r\n",
      "discriminated; it did lead to something after all, and she desired that\r\n",
      "for Francie it shouldn't lead to a union with Mr. Flack. She looked at\r\n",
      "such a union under the influence of that other view which she kept as\r\n",
      "yet to herself but was prepared to produce so soon as the right occasion\r\n",
      "should come up; giving her sister to understand that she would never\r\n",
      "speak to her again should this young man be allowed to suppose--! Which\r\n",
      "was where she always paused, plunging again into impressive reticence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To suppose what?\" Francie would ask as if she were totally\r\n",
      "unacquainted--which indeed she really was--with the suppositions of\r\n",
      "young men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you'll see--when he begins to say things you won't like!\" This\r\n",
      "sounded ominous on Delia's part, yet her anxiety was really but thin:\r\n",
      "otherwise she would have risen against the custom adopted by Mr. Flack\r\n",
      "of perpetually coming round. She would have given her attention--though\r\n",
      "it struggled in general unsuccessfully with all this side of their\r\n",
      "life--to some prompt means of getting away from Paris. She expressed to\r\n",
      "her father what in her view the correspondent of the Reverberator was\r\n",
      "\"after\"; but without, it must be added, gaining from him the sense of it\r\n",
      "as a connexion in which he could be greatly worked up. This indeed was\r\n",
      "not of importance, thanks to her inner faith that Francie would never\r\n",
      "really do anything--that is would never really like anything--her\r\n",
      "nearest relatives didn't like. Her sister's docility was a great comfort\r\n",
      "to Delia, the more that she herself, taking it always for granted, was\r\n",
      "the first to profit by it. She liked and disliked certain things much\r\n",
      "more than her junior did either; and Francie cultivated the convenience\r\n",
      "of her reasons, having so few of her own. They served--Delia's\r\n",
      "reasons--for Mr. Dosson as well, so that Francie was not guilty of any\r\n",
      "particular irreverence in regarding her sister rather than her father as\r\n",
      "the controller of her fate. A fate was rather an unwieldy and terrible\r\n",
      "treasure, which it relieved her that some kind person should undertake\r\n",
      "to administer. Delia had somehow got hold of hers first--before even her\r\n",
      "father, and ever so much before Mr. Flack; and it lay with Delia to make\r\n",
      "any change. She couldn't have accepted any gentleman as a party to an\r\n",
      "engagement--which was somehow as far as her imagination went--without\r\n",
      "reference to Delia, any more than she could have done up her hair\r\n",
      "without a glass. The only action taken by Mr. Dosson on his elder\r\n",
      "daughter's admonitions was to convert the general issue, as Mr. Flack\r\n",
      "would have called it, to a theme for daily pleasantry. He was fond,\r\n",
      "in his intercourse with his children, of some small usual joke, some\r\n",
      "humorous refrain; and what could have been more in the line of true\r\n",
      "domestic sport than a little gentle but unintermitted raillery on\r\n",
      "Francie's conquest? Mr. Flack's attributive intentions became a theme of\r\n",
      "indulgent parental chaff, and the girl was neither dazzled nor annoyed\r\n",
      "by the freedom of all this tribute. \"Well, he HAS told us about half\r\n",
      "we know,\" she used to reply with an air of the judicious that the\r\n",
      "undetected observer I am perpetually moved to invoke would have found\r\n",
      "indescribably quaint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among the items of knowledge for which they were indebted to him floated\r\n",
      "the fact that this was the very best time in the young lady's life to\r\n",
      "have her portrait painted and the best place in the world to have it\r\n",
      "done well; also that he knew a \"lovely artist,\" a young American of\r\n",
      "extraordinary talent, who would be delighted to undertake the job. He\r\n",
      "led his trio to this gentleman's studio, where they saw several\r\n",
      "pictures that opened to them the strange gates of mystification. Francie\r\n",
      "protested that she didn't want to be done in THAT style, and Delia\r\n",
      "declared that she would as soon have her sister shown up in a magic\r\n",
      "lantern. They had had the fortune not to find Mr. Waterlow at home, so\r\n",
      "that they were free to express themselves and the pictures were shown\r\n",
      "them by his servant. They looked at them as they looked at bonnets and\r\n",
      "confections when they went to expensive shops; as if it were a question,\r\n",
      "among so many specimens, of the style and colour they would choose.\r\n",
      "Mr. Waterlow's productions took their place for the most part in the\r\n",
      "category of those creations known to ladies as frights, and our friends\r\n",
      "retired with the lowest opinion of the young American master. George\r\n",
      "Flack told them however that they couldn't get out of it, inasmuch as\r\n",
      "he had already written home to the Reverberator that Francie was to sit.\r\n",
      "They accepted this somehow as a kind of supernatural sign that she would\r\n",
      "have to, for they believed everything they ever heard quoted from a\r\n",
      "newspaper. Moreover Mr. Flack explained to them that it would be idiotic\r\n",
      "to miss such an opportunity to get something at once precious and cheap;\r\n",
      "for it was well known that impressionism was going to be the art of the\r\n",
      "future, and Charles Waterlow was a rising impressionist. It was a new\r\n",
      "system altogether and the latest improvement in art. They didn't want\r\n",
      "to go back, they wanted to go forward, and he would give them an\r\n",
      "article that would fetch five times the money in about five years--which\r\n",
      "somehow, as he put it, seemed a very short time, though it would have\r\n",
      "seemed immense for anything else. They were not in search of a bargain,\r\n",
      "but they allowed themselves to be inoculated with any reason they\r\n",
      "thought would be characteristic of informed people; and he even\r\n",
      "convinced them after a little that when once they had got used to\r\n",
      "impressionism they would never look at anything else. Mr. Waterlow\r\n",
      "was the man, among the young, and he had no interest in praising him,\r\n",
      "because he was not a personal friend: his reputation was advancing\r\n",
      "with strides, and any one with any sense would want to secure something\r\n",

      "impression on the gentleman who was with him and who never took his eyes\r\n",
      "off her while her own rested afresh on several finished and unfinished\r\n",

      "the favour of an introduction to her; in consequence of which Francie\r\n",
      "learned that his name--she thought it singular--was Gaston Probert. Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert was a kind-eyed smiling youth who fingered the points of his\r\n",

      "each other that the girl had qualities--oh but qualities and a charm\r\n",
      "of line! They remained there an hour, studying these rare properties\r\n",
      "through the smoke of their cigarettes. You would have gathered from\r\n",
      "their conversation--though as regards much of it only perhaps with the\r\n",
      "aid of a grammar and dictionary--that the young lady had been endowed\r\n",
      "with plastic treasures, that is with physical graces, of the highest\r\n",
      "order, of which she was evidently quite unconscious. Before this,\r\n",
      "however, Mr. Waterlow had come to an understanding with his visitors--it\r\n",
      "had been settled that Miss Francina should sit for him at his first hour\r\n",
      "of leisure. Unfortunately that hour hovered before him as still rather\r\n",
      "distant--he was unable to make a definite appointment. He had sitters\r\n",
      "on his hands, he had at least three portraits to finish before going\r\n",
      "to Spain. He adverted with bitterness to the journey to Spain--a little\r\n",
      "excursion laid out precisely with his friend Probert for the last weeks\r\n",
      "of the spring, the first of the southern summer, the time of the long\r\n",
      "days and the real light. Gaston Probert re-echoed his regrets, for\r\n",
      "though he had no business with Miss Francina, whose name he yet liked,\r\n",
      "he also wanted to see her again. They half-agreed to give up Spain--they\r\n",
      "had after all been there before--so that Waterlow might take the girl in\r\n",
      "hand without delay, the moment he had knocked off his present work. This\r\n",
      "amendment broke down indeed, for other considerations came up and the\r\n",
      "artist resigned himself to the arrangement on which the young women had\r\n",
      "quitted him: he thought it so characteristic of their nationality that\r\n",
      "they should settle a matter of that sort for themselves. This was\r\n",
      "simply that they should come back in the autumn, when he should be\r\n",
      "comparatively free: then there would be a margin and they might all take\r\n",
      "their time. At present, before long--by the time he should be ready--the\r\n",
      "question of the pretty one's leaving Paris for the summer would be\r\n",
      "sure to rise, and that would be a tiresome interruption. The pretty one\r\n",
      "clearly liked Paris, she had no plans for the autumn and only wanted\r\n",
      "a reason to come back about the twentieth of September. Mr. Waterlow\r\n",
      "remarked humorously that she evidently bossed the shop. Meanwhile,\r\n",
      "before starting for Spain, he would see her as often as possible--his\r\n",
      "eye would take possession of her.\r\n",

      "perhaps as a step towards establishing his right to jealousy that Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert left a card upon the Miss Dossons at the Hotel de l'Univers et\r\n",
      "de Cheltenham, having first ascertained that such a proceeding would\r\n",
      "not, by the young American sisters, be regarded as an unwarrantable\r\n",
      "liberty. Gaston Probert was an American who had never been in America\r\n",
      "and was obliged to take counsel on such an emergency as that. He knew\r\n",
      "that in Paris young men didn't call at hotels on blameless maids, but\r\n",
      "he also knew that blameless maids, unattended by a parent, didn't visit\r\n",
      "young men in studios; and he had no guide, no light he could trust--none\r\n",
      "save the wisdom of his friend Waterlow, which was for the most part\r\n",
      "communicated to him in a derisive and misleading form. Waterlow, who\r\n",
      "was after all himself an ornament of the French, and the very French,\r\n",
      "school, jeered at the other's want of native instinct, at the way he\r\n",
      "never knew by which end to take hold of a compatriot. Poor Probert was\r\n",
      "obliged to confess to his terrible paucity of practice, and that in\r\n",
      "the great medley of aliens and brothers--and even more of sisters--he\r\n",
      "couldn't tell which was which. He would have had a country and\r\n",
      "countrymen, to say nothing of countrywomen, if he could; but that matter\r\n",
      "had never been properly settled for him, and it's one there's ever a\r\n",
      "great difficulty in a gentleman's settling for himself. Born in Paris,\r\n",
      "he had been brought up altogether on French lines, in a family that\r\n",
      "French society had irrecoverably absorbed. His father, a Carolinian\r\n",
      "and a Catholic, was a Gallomaniac of the old American type. His three\r\n",
      "sisters had married Frenchmen, and one of them lived in Brittany while\r\n",
      "the others were ostensibly seated in Touraine. His only brother had\r\n",
      "fallen, during the Terrible Year, in defence of their adopted country.\r\n",
      "Yet Gaston, though he had had an old Legitimist marquis for godfather,\r\n",
      "was not legally one of its children; his mother had, on her death-bed,\r\n",
      "extorted from him the promise that he wouldn't take service in its\r\n",
      "armies; she considered, after the death of her elder son--Gaston, in\r\n",
      "1870, had been a boy of ten--that the family had sacrificed enough on\r\n",
      "the altar of sympathy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man therefore, between two stools, had no clear sitting-place:\r\n",
      "he wanted to be as American as he could and yet not less French than he\r\n",
      "was; he was afraid to give up the little that he was and find that what\r\n",
      "he might be was less--he shrank from a flying leap which might drop him\r\n",
      "in the middle of the sea. At the same time he thought himself sure that\r\n",
      "the only way to know how it feels to be an American is to try it, and\r\n",
      "he had had many a purpose of making the pious pilgrimage. His family\r\n",
      "however had been so completely Gallicised that the affairs of each\r\n",
      "member of it were the affairs of all the rest, and his father, his\r\n",
      "sisters and his brothers-in-law had not yet begun sufficiently to regard\r\n",
      "this scheme as their own for him to feel it substantially his. It was a\r\n",
      "family in which there was no individual but only a collective property.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile he tried, as I say, by affronting minor perils, and especially\r\n",
      "by going a good deal to see Charles Waterlow in the Avenue de Villiers,\r\n",
      "whom he believed to be his dearest friend, formed for his affection by\r\n",
      "Monsieur Carolus. He had an idea that in this manner he kept himself\r\n",
      "in touch with his countrymen; and he had never pitched his endeavour so\r\n",
      "high as in leaving that card on the Misses Dosson. He was in search of\r\n",
      "freshness, but he needn't have gone far: he would have had but to turn\r\n",
      "his lantern on his own young breast to find a considerable store of it.\r\n",
      "Like many of his dawdling coaevals he gave much attention to art, lived\r\n",
      "as much as possible in that more select world where it is a positive\r\n",
      "duty not to bustle. To make up for his want of talent he espoused\r\n",
      "the talent of others--that is of several--and was as sensitive and\r\n",
      "conscientious about them as he might have been about himself. He\r\n",
      "defended certain of Waterlow's purples and greens as he would have\r\n",
      "defended his own honour, and there was a genius or two, not yet fully\r\n",
      "acclaimed by the vulgar, in regard to whom he had convictions that\r\n",
      "belonged almost to the undiscussable part of life. He had not, for\r\n",
      "himself, any very high sense of performance, but what kept it down\r\n",
      "particularly was his untractable hand, the fact that, such as they were,\r\n",
      "Waterlow's purples and greens, for instance, were far beyond him. If he\r\n",
      "hadn't failed there other failures wouldn't have mattered, not even\r\n",
      "that of not having a country; and it was on the occasion of his friend's\r\n",
      "agreement to paint that strange lovely girl, whom he liked so much\r\n",
      "and whose companions he didn't like, that he felt supremely without a\r\n",
      "vocation. Freshness was in HER at least, if he had only been organised\r\n",
      "for catching it. He prayed earnestly, in relation to such a triumph,\r\n",
      "for a providential re-enforcement of Waterlow's sense of that source\r\n",
      "of charm. If Waterlow had a fault it was that his freshnesses were\r\n",
      "sometimes too crude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He avenged himself for the artist's profanation of his first attempt\r\n",
      "to approach Miss Francie by indulging at the end of another week in\r\n",
      "a second. He went about six o'clock, when he supposed she would have\r\n",
      "returned from her day's wanderings, and his prudence was rewarded by\r\n",
      "the sight of the young lady sitting in the court of the hotel with her\r\n",
      "father and sister. Mr. Dosson was new to Gaston Probert, but the young\r\n",
      "man might have been a naturalist visiting a rank country with a net of\r\n",
      "such narrow meshes as to let no creature of the air escape. The little\r\n",
      "party was as usual expecting Mr. Flack at any moment, and they had\r\n",
      "collected downstairs, so that he might pick them up easily. They had, on\r\n",
      "the first floor, an expensive parlour, decorated in white and gold, with\r\n",
      "sofas of crimson damask; but there was something lonely in that grandeur\r\n",
      "and the place had become mainly a receptacle for their tall trunks, with\r\n",
      "a half-emptied paper of chocolates or marrons glaces on every table.\r\n",
      "After young Probert's first call his name was often on the lips of the\r\n",
      "simple trio, and Mr. Dosson grew still more jocose, making nothing of a\r\n",
      "secret of his perception that Francie hit the bull's-eye \"every time.\"\r\n",
      "Mr. Waterlow had returned their visit, but that was rather a matter\r\n",
      "of course, since it was they who had gone after him. They had not gone\r\n",
      "after the other one; it was he who had come after them. When he entered\r\n",
      "the hotel, as they sat there, this pursuit and its probable motive\r\n",
      "became startlingly vivid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia had taken the matter much more seriously than her father; she\r\n",
      "said there was ever so much she wanted to find out. She mused upon\r\n",
      "these mysteries visibly, but with no great advance, and she appealed\r\n",
      "for assistance to George Flack, with a candour which he appreciated and\r\n",
      "returned. If he really knew anything he ought to know at least who Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert was; and she spoke as if it would be in the natural course that\r\n",
      "as soon as he should find out he would put it for them somehow into his\r\n",
      "paper. Mr. Flack promised to \"nose round\"; he said the best plan would\r\n",
      "be that the results should \"come back\" to her in the Reverberator; it\r\n",
      "might have been gathered from him that \"the people over there\"--in other\r\n",
      "words the mass of their compatriots--wouldn't be unpersuadable that they\r\n",
      "wanted about a column on Mr. Probert. His researches were to prove none\r\n",
      "the less fruitless, for in spite of the vivid fact the girl was able to\r\n",
      "give him as a starting-point, the fact that their new acquaintance had\r\n",
      "spent his whole life in Paris, the young journalist couldn't scare up a\r\n",
      "single person who had even heard of him. He had questioned up and down\r\n",
      "and all over the place, from the Rue Scribe to the far end of Chaillot,\r\n",
      "and he knew people who knew others who knew every member of the\r\n",
      "American colony; that select settled body, which haunted poor Delia's\r\n",
      "imagination, glittered and re-echoed there in a hundred tormenting\r\n",
      "roundabout glimpses. That was where she wanted to \"get\" Francie, as she\r\n",
      "said to herself; she wanted to get her right in there. She believed the\r\n",
      "members of this society to constitute a little kingdom of the blest; and\r\n",
      "she used to drive through the Avenue Gabriel, the Rue de Marignan and\r\n",
      "the wide vistas which radiate from the Arch of Triumph and are always\r\n",
      "changing their names, on purpose to send up wistful glances to the\r\n",
      "windows--she had learned that all this was the happy quarter--of the\r\n",
      "enviable but unapproachable colonists. She saw these privileged mortals,\r\n",
      "as she supposed, in almost every victoria that made a languid lady with\r\n",
      "a pretty head dash past her, and she had no idea how little honour this\r\n",
      "theory sometimes did her expatriated countrywomen. Her plan was already\r\n",
      "made to be on the field again the next winter and take it up seriously,\r\n",
      "this question of getting Francie in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Mr. Flack remarked that young Probert's net couldn't be either the\r\n",
      "rose or anything near it, since they had shed no petal, at any general\r\n",
      "shake, on the path of the oldest inhabitant, Delia had a flash of\r\n",
      "inspiration, an intellectual flight that she herself didn't measure at\r\n",
      "the time. She asked if that didn't perhaps prove on the contrary quite\r\n",
      "the opposite--that they were just THE cream and beyond all others.\r\n",
      "Wasn't there a kind of inner, very FAR in, circle, and wouldn't they be\r\n",
      "somewhere about the centre of that? George Flack almost quivered at\r\n",
      "this weird hit as from one of the blind, for he guessed on the spot that\r\n",
      "Delia Dosson had, as he would have said, got there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, do you mean one of those families that have worked down so far\r\n",
      "you can't find where they went in?\"--that was the phrase in which he\r\n",
      "recognised the truth of the girl's grope. Delia's fixed eyes assented,\r\n",
      "and after a moment of cogitation George Flack broke out: \"That's the\r\n",
      "kind of family we want to handle!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, perhaps they won't want to be handled,\" Delia had returned with\r\n",
      "a still wilder and more remarkable play of inspiration. \"You had better\r\n",
      "find out,\" she had added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chance to find out might have seemed to present itself after Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert had walked in that confiding way into the hotel; for his\r\n",
      "arrival had been followed a quarter of an hour later by that of the\r\n",
      "representative of the Reverberator. Gaston had liked the way they\r\n",
      "treated him--though demonstrative it was not artificial. Mr. Dosson\r\n",
      "had said they had been hoping he would come round again, and Delia had\r\n",
      "remarked that she supposed he had had quite a journey--Paris was so\r\n",
      "big; and had urged his acceptance of a glass of wine or a cup of tea.\r\n",
      "Mentioning that that wasn't the place where they usually received--she\r\n",
      "liked to hear herself talk of \"receiving\"--she led the party up to her\r\n",
      "white-and-gold saloon, where they should be so much more private: she\r\n",
      "liked also to hear herself talk of privacy. They sat on the red silk\r\n",
      "chairs and she hoped Mr. Probert would at least taste a sugared chestnut\r\n",
      "or a chocolate; and when he declined, pleading the imminence of the\r\n",
      "dinner-hour, she sighed: \"Well, I suppose you're so used to them--to the\r\n",
      "best--living so long over here.\" The allusion to the dinner-hour led\r\n",
      "Mr. Dosson to the frank hope that he would go round and dine with them\r\n",
      "without ceremony; they were expecting a friend--he generally settled it\r\n",
      "for them--who was coming to take them round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And then we're going to the circus,\" Francie said, speaking for the\r\n",
      "first time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If she had not spoken before she had done something still more to the\r\n",
      "purpose; she had removed any shade of doubt that might have lingered in\r\n",
      "the young man's spirit as to her charm of line. He was aware that the\r\n",
      "education of Paris, acting upon a natural aptitude, had opened him\r\n",
      "much--rendered him perhaps even morbidly sensitive--to impressions of\r\n",
      "this order; the society of artists, the talk of studios, the attentive\r\n",
      "study of beautiful works, the sight of a thousand forms of curious\r\n",
      "research and experiment, had produced in his mind a new sense,\r\n",
      "the exercise of which was a conscious enjoyment and the supreme\r\n",
      "gratification of which, on several occasions, had given him as many\r\n",
      "indelible memories. He had once said to his friend Waterlow: \"I don't\r\n",
      "know whether it's a confession of a very poor life, but the most\r\n",
      "important things that have happened to me in this world have been simply\r\n",
      "half a dozen visual impressions--things that happened through my eyes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah malheureux, you're lost!\" the painter had exclaimed in answer to\r\n",
      "this, and without even taking the trouble to explain his ominous speech.\r\n",
      "Gaston Probert however had not been frightened by it, and he continued\r\n",
      "to be thankful for the sensitive plate that nature had lodged in his\r\n",
      "brain and that culture had brought to so high a polish. The experience\r\n",
      "of the eye was doubtless not everything, but it was so much gained, so\r\n",
      "much saved, in a world in which other treasures were apt to slip through\r\n",
      "one's fingers; and above all it had the merit that so many things gave\r\n",
      "it and that nothing could take it away. He had noted in a moment how\r\n",
      "straight Francie Dosson gave it; and now, seeing her a second time, he\r\n",
      "felt her promote it in a degree which made acquaintance with her one of\r\n",
      "those \"important\" facts of which he had spoken to Charles Waterlow. It\r\n",
      "was in the case of such an accident as this that he felt the value of\r\n",
      "his Parisian education. It made him revel in his modern sense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was therefore not directly the prospect of the circus that induced\r\n",
      "him to accept Mr. Dosson's invitation; nor was it even the charm exerted\r\n",
      "by the girl's appearing, in the few words she uttered, to appeal to him\r\n",
      "for herself. It was his feeling that on the edge of the glittering ring\r\n",
      "her type would attach him to her, to her only, and that if he knew it\r\n",
      "was rare she herself didn't. He liked to be intensely conscious, but\r\n",
      "liked others not to be. It seemed to him at this moment, after he had\r\n",
      "told Mr. Dosson he should be delighted to spend the evening with them,\r\n",
      "that he was indeed trying hard to measure how it would feel to recover\r\n",
      "the national tie; he had jumped on the ship, he was pitching away to the\r\n",
      "west. He had led his sister, Mme. de Brecourt, to expect that he would\r\n",
      "dine with her--she was having a little party; so that if she could see\r\n",
      "the people to whom, without a scruple, with a quick sense of refreshment\r\n",
      "and freedom, he now sacrificed her! He knew who was coming to his\r\n",
      "sister's in the Place Beauvau: Mme. d'Outreville and M. de Grospre, old\r\n",
      "M. Courageau, Mme. de Drives, Lord and Lady Trantum, Mile de Saintonge;\r\n",
      "but he was fascinated by the idea of the contrast between what he\r\n",
      "preferred and what he gave up. His life had long been wanting--painfully\r\n",
      "wanting--in the element of contrast, and here was a chance to bring it\r\n",
      "in. He saw it come in powerfully with Mr. Flack, after Miss Dosson had\r\n",
      "proposed they should walk off without their initiator. Her father didn't\r\n",
      "favour this suggestion; he said \"We want a double good dinner to-day and\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack has got to order it.\" Upon this Delia had asked the visitor\r\n",
      "if HE couldn't order--a Frenchman like him; and Francie had interrupted,\r\n",
      "before he could answer the question, \"Well, ARE you a Frenchman? That's\r\n",
      "just the point, ain't it?\" Gaston Probert replied that he had no wish\r\n",
      "but to be a citizen of HER country, and the elder sister asked him if he\r\n",
      "knew many Americans in Paris. He was obliged to confess he knew almost\r\n",
      "none, but hastened to add he was eager to go on now he had taken such a\r\n",
      "charming start.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh we ain't anything--if you mean that,\" Delia said. \"If you go on\r\n",
      "you'll go on beyond us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We ain't anything here, my dear, but we're a good deal at home,\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson jocosely interjected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think we're very nice anywhere!\" Francie exclaimed; upon which Gaston\r\n",
      "Probert declared that they were as delightful as possible. It was in\r\n",
      "these amenities that George Flack found them engaged; but there was none\r\n",
      "the less a certain eagerness in his greeting of the other guest, as if\r\n",
      "he had it in mind to ask him how soon he could give him half an hour.\r\n",
      "I hasten to add that with the turn the occasion presently took the\r\n",
      "correspondent of the Reverberator dropped the conception of making the\r\n",
      "young man \"talk\" for the benefit of the subscribers to that journal.\r\n",
      "They all went out together, and the impulse to pick up something,\r\n",
      "usually so irresistible in George Flack's mind, suffered an odd check.\r\n",
      "He found himself wanting to handle his fellow visitor in a sense other\r\n",
      "than the professional. Mr. Probert talked very little to Francie, but\r\n",
      "though Mr. Flack didn't know that on a first occasion he would have\r\n",
      "thought this aggressive, even rather brutal, he knew it was for Francie,\r\n",
      "and Francie alone, that the fifth member of the party was there. He said\r\n",
      "to himself suddenly and in perfect sincerity that it was a mean class\r\n",
      "anyway, the people for whom their own country wasn't good enough.\r\n",
      "He didn't go so far, however, when they were seated at the admirable\r\n",
      "establishment of M. Durand in the Place de la Madeleine, as to order\r\n",
      "a bad dinner to spite his competitor; nor did he, to spoil this\r\n",
      "gentleman's amusement, take uncomfortable seats at the pretty circus in\r\n",
      "the Champs Elysees to which, at half-past eight o'clock, the company was\r\n",
      "conveyed--it was a drive of but five minutes--in a couple of cabs. The\r\n",
      "occasion therefore was superficially smooth, and he could see that the\r\n",
      "sense of being disagreeable to an American newspaper-man was not needed\r\n",
      "to make his nondescript rival enjoy it. That gentleman did indeed hate\r\n",
      "his crude accent and vulgar laugh and above all the lamblike submission\r\n",
      "to him of their friends. Mr. Flack was acute enough for an important\r\n",
      "observation: he cherished it and promised himself to bring it to the\r\n",
      "notice of his clinging charges. Their imperturbable guest professed a\r\n",
      "great desire to be of service to the young ladies--to do what would help\r\n",
      "them to be happy in Paris; but he gave no hint of the intention that\r\n",
      "would contribute most to such a result, the bringing them in contact\r\n",
      "with the other members, especially with the female members, of his\r\n",
      "family. George Flack knew nothing about the matter, but he required\r\n",
      "for purposes of argument that Mr. Probert's family should have female\r\n",
      "members, and it was lucky for him that his assumption was just. He\r\n",
      "grasped in advance the effect with which he should impress it on Francie\r\n",
      "and Delia--but notably on Delia, who would then herself impress it on\r\n",
      "Francie--that it would be time for their French friend to talk when he\r\n",
      "had brought his mother round. BUT HE NEVER WOULD--they might bet their\r\n",
      "pile on that! He never did, in the strange sequel--having, poor young\r\n",
      "man, no mother to bring. Moreover he was quite mum--as Delia phrased it\r\n",
      "to herself--about Mme. de Brecourt and Mme. de Cliche: such, Miss Dosson\r\n",
      "learned from Charles Waterlow, were the names of his two sisters who had\r\n",
      "houses in Paris--gleaning at the same time the information that one\r\n",
      "of these ladies was a marquise and the other a comtesse. She was less\r\n",
      "exasperated by their non-appearance than Mr. Flack had hoped, and it\r\n",
      "didn't prevent an excursion to dine at Saint-Germain a week after the\r\n",
      "evening spent at the circus, which included both the new admirers. It\r\n",
      "also as a matter of course included Mr. Flack, for though the party had\r\n",
      "been proposed in the first instance by Charles Waterlow, who wished to\r\n",
      "multiply opportunities for studying his future sitter, Mr. Dosson had\r\n",
      "characteristically constituted himself host and administrator, with the\r\n",
      "young journalist as his deputy. He liked to invite people and to pay\r\n",
      "for them, and disliked to be invited and paid for. He was never inwardly\r\n",
      "content on any occasion unless a great deal of money was spent, and he\r\n",
      "could be sure enough of the large amount only when he himself spent it.\r\n",
      "He was too simple for conceit or for pride of purse, but always felt\r\n",
      "any arrangements shabby and sneaking as to which the expense hadn't been\r\n",
      "referred to him. He never named what he paid for anything. Also Delia\r\n",
      "had made him understand that if they should go to Saint-Germain as\r\n",
      "guests of the artist and his friend Mr. Flack wouldn't be of the\r\n",
      "company: she was sure those gentlemen wouldn't rope HIM in. In fact\r\n",
      "she was too sure, for, though enjoying him not at all, Charles Waterlow\r\n",
      "would on this occasion have made a point of expressing by an act of\r\n",
      "courtesy his sense of obligation to a man who had brought him such a\r\n",
      "subject. Delia's hint however was all-sufficient for her father; he\r\n",
      "would have thought it a gross breach of friendly loyalty to take part in\r\n",
      "a festival not graced by Mr. Flack's presence. His idea of loyalty was\r\n",
      "that he should scarcely smoke a cigar unless his friend was there to\r\n",
      "take another, and he felt rather mean if he went round alone to get\r\n",
      "shaved. As regards Saint-Germain he took over the project while George\r\n",
      "Flack telegraphed for a table on the terrace at the Pavilion Henri\r\n",
      "Quatre. Mr. Dosson had by this time learned to trust the European\r\n",
      "manager of the Reverberator to spend his money almost as he himself\r\n",
      "would.\r\n",

      "IV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia had broken out the evening they took Mr. Probert to the circus;\r\n",
      "she had apostrophised Francie as they each sat in a red-damask chair\r\n",
      "after ascending to their apartments. They had bade their companions\r\n",
      "farewell at the door of the hotel and the two gentlemen had walked\r\n",
      "off in different directions. But upstairs they had instinctively not\r\n",
      "separated; they dropped into the first places and sat looking at each\r\n",
      "other and at the highly-decorated lamps that burned night after night\r\n",
      "in their empty saloon. \"Well, I want to know when you're going to\r\n",
      "stop,\" Delia said to her sister, speaking as if this remark were a\r\n",
      "continuation, which it was not, of something they had lately been\r\n",
      "saying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop what?\" asked Francie, reaching forward for a marron.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop carrying-on the way you do--with Mr. Flack.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie stared while she consumed her marron; then she replied in\r\n",
      "her small flat patient voice: \"Why, Delia Dosson, how can you be so\r\n",
      "foolish?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Father, I wish you'd speak to her. Francie, I ain't foolish,\" Delia\r\n",
      "submitted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you want me to say to her?\" Mr. Dosson enquired. \"I guess I've\r\n",
      "said about all I know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that's in fun. I want you to speak to her in earnest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I guess there's no one in earnest but you,\" Francie remarked. \"These\r\n",
      "ain't so good as the last.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"NO, and there won't be if you don't look out. There's something you\r\n",
      "can do if you'll just keep quiet. If you can't tell difference of style,\r\n",
      "well, I can!\" Delia cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the difference of style?\" asked Mr. Dosson. But before this\r\n",
      "question could be answered Francie protested against the charge of\r\n",
      "\"carrying-on.\" Quiet? Wasn't she as quiet as a Quaker meeting? Delia\r\n",
      "replied that a girl wasn't quiet so long as she didn't keep others so;\r\n",
      "and she wanted to know what her sister proposed to do about Mr. Flack.\r\n",
      "\"Why don't you take him and let Francie take the other?\" Mr. Dosson\r\n",
      "continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just what I'm after--to make her take the other,\" said his elder\r\n",
      "daughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Take him--how do you mean?\" Francie returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you know how.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I guess you know how!\" Mr. Dosson laughed with an absence of\r\n",
      "prejudice that might have been deplored in a parent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you want to stay in Europe or not? that's what _I_ want to know,\"\r\n",
      "Delia pursued to her sister. \"If you want to go bang home you're taking\r\n",
      "the right way to do it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What has that got to do with it?\" Mr. Dosson audibly wondered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Should you like so much to reside at that place--where is it?--where\r\n",
      "his paper's published? That's where you'll have to pull up sooner or\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you want to stay right here in Europe, father?\" Francie said with\r\n",
      "her small sweet weariness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It depends on what you mean by staying right here. I want to go right\r\n",
      "home SOME time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then you've got to go without Mr. Probert,\" Delia made answer with\r\n",
      "decision. \"If you think he wants to live over there--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why Delia, he wants dreadfully to go--he told me so himself,\" Francie\r\n",
      "argued with passionless pauses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and when he gets there he'll want to come back. I thought you were\r\n",
      "so much interested in Paris.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My poor child, I AM interested!\" smiled Francie. \"Ain't I interested,\r\n",
      "father?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know how you could act differently to show it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I guess he does--he IS bright,\" said Mr. Dosson. \"Good-night,\r\n",
      "chickens,\" he added; and wandered off to a couch of untroubled repose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His daughters sat up half an hour later, but not by the wish of the\r\n",
      "younger girl. She was always passive, however, always docile when\r\n",
      "Delia was, as she said, on the war-path, and though she had none of her\r\n",
      "sister's insistence she was courageous in suffering. She thought Delia\r\n",

      "it hurt her to be heavily exhorted, much as it would have done to be\r\n",
      "violently pushed. She knew Delia loved her--not loving herself meanwhile\r\n",
      "a bit--as no one else in the world probably ever would; but there was\r\n",
      "something funny in such plans for her--plans of ambition which could\r\n",
      "only involve a \"fuss.\" The real answer to anything, to everything her\r\n",
      "sister might say at these hours of urgency was: \"Oh if you want to make\r\n",
      "out that people are thinking of me or that they ever will, you ought to\r\n",
      "remember that no one can possibly think of me half as much as you do.\r\n",
      "Therefore if there's to be any comfort for either of us we had both much\r\n",
      "better just go on as we are.\" She didn't however on this occasion meet\r\n",
      "her constant companion with that syllogism, because a formidable force\r\n",
      "seemed to lurk in the great contention that the star of matrimony for\r\n",
      "the American girl was now shining in the east--in England and France\r\n",
      "and Italy. They had only to look round anywhere to see it: what did\r\n",
      "they hear of every day in the week but of the engagement of somebody no\r\n",
      "better than they to some count or some lord? Delia dwelt on the evident\r\n",
      "truth that it was in that vast vague section of the globe to which she\r\n",
      "never alluded save as \"over here\" that the American girl was now called\r\n",
      "upon to play, under providence, her part. When Francie made the point\r\n",
      "that Mr. Probert was neither a count nor a lord her sister rejoined that\r\n",
      "she didn't care whether he was or not. To this Francie replied that she\r\n",
      "herself didn't care, but that Delia ought to for consistency.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, he's a prince compared with Mr. Flack,\" Delia declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He hasn't the same ability; not half.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has the ability to have three sisters who are just the sort of\r\n",
      "people I want you to know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What good will they do me?\" Francie asked. \"They'll hate me. Before\r\n",
      "they could turn round I should do something--in perfect innocence--that\r\n",
      "they'd think monstrous.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what would that matter if HE liked you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but he wouldn't then! He'd hate me too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then all you've got to do is not to do it,\" Delia concluded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but I should--every time,\" her sister went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia looked at her a moment. \"What ARE you talking about?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, what am I? It's disgusting!\" And Francie sprang up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sorry you have such thoughts,\" said Delia sententiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's disgusting to talk about a gentleman--and his sisters and his\r\n",
      "society and everything else--before he has scarcely looked at you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's disgusting if he isn't just dying; but it isn't if he is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'll make him skip!\" Francie went on with a sudden approach to\r\n",
      "sharpness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you're worse than father!\" her sister cried, giving her a push as\r\n",
      "they went to bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They reached Saint-Germain with their companions nearly an hour before\r\n",
      "the time it had been agreed they had best dine; the purpose of this\r\n",
      "being to enable them to enjoy with what remained of daylight a stroll on\r\n",
      "the celebrated terrace and a study of the magnificent view. The evening\r\n",
      "was splendid and the atmosphere favourable to these impressions; the\r\n",
      "grass was vivid on the broad walk beside the parapet, the park and\r\n",
      "forest were fresh and leafy and the prettiest golden light hung over\r\n",
      "the curving Seine and the far-spreading city. The hill which forms the\r\n",
      "terrace stretched down among the vineyards, with the poles delicate yet\r\n",
      "in their bareness, to the river, and the prospect was spotted here\r\n",
      "and there with the red legs of the little sauntering soldiers of\r\n",
      "the garrison. How it came, after Delia's warning in regard to her\r\n",
      "carrying-on--especially as she hadn't failed to feel the weight of her\r\n",
      "sister's wisdom--Francie couldn't have told herself: certain it is that\r\n",
      "before ten minutes had elapsed she became aware, first, that the evening\r\n",
      "wouldn't pass without Mr. Flack's taking in some way, and for a certain\r\n",
      "time, peculiar possession of her; and then that he was already doing so,\r\n",
      "that he had drawn her away from the others, who were stopping behind to\r\n",
      "appreciate the view, that he made her walk faster, and that he had ended\r\n",
      "by interposing such a distance that she was practically alone with him.\r\n",
      "This was what he wanted, but it was not all; she saw he now wanted a\r\n",
      "great many other things. The large perspective of the terrace stretched\r\n",
      "away before them--Mr. Probert had said it was in the grand style--and\r\n",
      "he was determined to make her walk to the end. She felt sorry for his\r\n",
      "ideas--she thought of them in the light of his striking energy; they\r\n",
      "were an idle exercise of a force intrinsically fine, and she wanted to\r\n",
      "protest, to let him know how truly it was a sad misuse of his free bold\r\n",
      "spirit to count on her. She was not to be counted on; she was a vague\r\n",
      "soft negative being who had never decided anything and never would, who\r\n",
      "had not even the merit of knowing how to flirt and who only asked to\r\n",
      "be let alone. She made him stop at last, telling him, while she leaned\r\n",
      "against the parapet, that he walked too fast; and she looked back at\r\n",
      "their companions, whom she expected to see, under pressure from Delia,\r\n",
      "following at the highest speed. But they were not following; they still\r\n",
      "stood together there, only looking, attentively enough, at the couple\r\n",
      "who had left them. Delia would wave a parasol, beckon her back, send Mr.\r\n",
      "Waterlow to bring her; Francie invoked from one moment to another some\r\n",
      "such appeal as that. But no appeal came; none at least but the odd\r\n",
      "spectacle, presently, of an agitation of the group, which, evidently\r\n",
      "under Delia's direction, turned round and retraced its steps. Francie\r\n",
      "guessed in a moment what was meant by that; it was the most definite\r\n",
      "signal her sister could have given. It made her feel that Delia counted\r\n",
      "on her, but to such a different end, just as poor Mr. Flack did, just as\r\n",
      "Delia wished to persuade her that Mr. Probert did. The girl gave a sigh,\r\n",
      "looking up with troubled eyes at her companion and at the figure of\r\n",
      "herself as the subject of contending policies. Such a thankless bored\r\n",
      "evasive little subject as she felt herself! What Delia had said in\r\n",
      "turning away was--\"Yes, I'm watching you, and I depend on you to finish\r\n",
      "him up. Stay there with him, go off with him--I'll allow you half an\r\n",
      "hour if necessary: only settle him once for all. It's very kind of me\r\n",
      "to give you this chance, and in return for it I expect you to be able to\r\n",
      "tell me this evening that he has his answer. Shut him up!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie didn't in the least dislike Mr. Flack. Interested as I am in\r\n",
      "presenting her favourably to the reader I am yet obliged as a veracious\r\n",
      "historian to admit that she believed him as \"bright\" as her father had\r\n",
      "originally pronounced him and as any young man she was likely to\r\n",
      "meet. She had no other measure for distinction in young men but their\r\n",
      "brightness; she had never been present at any imputation of ability or\r\n",
      "power that this term didn't seem to cover. In many a girl so great a\r\n",
      "kindness might have been fanned to something of a flame by the breath of\r\n",
      "close criticism. I probably exaggerate little the perversity of pretty\r\n",
      "girls in saying that our young woman might at this moment have answered\r\n",
      "her sister with: \"No, I wasn't in love with him, but somehow, since\r\n",
      "you're so very disgusted, I foresee that I shall be if he presses\r\n",
      "me.\" It is doubtless difficult to say more for Francie's simplicity of\r\n",
      "character than that she felt no need of encouraging Mr. Flack in order\r\n",
      "to prove to herself that she wasn't bullied. She didn't care whether\r\n",
      "she were bullied or not, and she was perfectly capable of letting Delia\r\n",
      "believe her to have carried mildness to the point of giving up a man\r\n",
      "she had a secret sentiment for in order to oblige a relative who\r\n",
      "fairly brooded with devotion. She wasn't clear herself as to whether it\r\n",
      "mightn't be so; her pride, what she had of it, lay in an undistributed\r\n",
      "inert form quite at the bottom of her heart, and she had never yet\r\n",
      "thought of a dignified theory to cover her want of uppishness. She felt\r\n",
      "as she looked up at Mr. Flack that she didn't care even if he should\r\n",
      "think she sacrificed him to a childish docility. His bright eyes were\r\n",
      "hard, as if he could almost guess how cynical she was, and she turned\r\n",
      "her own again toward her retreating companions. \"They're going to\r\n",
      "dinner; we oughtn't to be dawdling here,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if they're going to dinner they'll have to eat the napkins.\r\n",
      "I ordered it and I know when it'll be ready,\" George Flack answered.\r\n",
      "\"Besides, they're not going to dinner, they're going to walk in the\r\n",
      "park. Don't you worry, we shan't lose them. I wish we could!\" the young\r\n",
      "man added in his boldest gayest manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You wish we could?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should like to feel you just under my particular protection and no\r\n",
      "other.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know what the dangers are,\" said Francie, setting herself\r\n",
      "in motion again. She went after the others, but at the end of a few\r\n",
      "steps he stopped her again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You won't have confidence. I wish you'd believe what I tell you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You haven't told me anything.\" And she turned her back to him, looking\r\n",
      "away at the splendid view. \"I do love the scenery,\" she added in a\r\n",
      "moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, leave it alone a little--it won't run away! I want to tell\r\n",
      "you something about myself, if I could flatter myself you'd take any\r\n",
      "interest in it.\" He had thrust the raised point of his cane into the low\r\n",
      "wall of the terrace, and he leaned on the knob, screwing the other end\r\n",
      "gently round with both hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll take an interest if I can understand,\" said Francie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You can understand right enough if you'll try. I got to-day some news\r\n",
      "from America,\" he went on, \"that I like awfully. The Reverberator has\r\n",
      "taken a jump.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not what Francie had expected, but it was better. \"Taken a\r\n",
      "jump?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It has gone straight up. It's in the second hundred thousand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hundred thousand dollars?\" said Francie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, Miss Francie, copies. That's the circulation. But the dollars are\r\n",
      "footing up too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And do they all come to you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Precious few of them! I wish they did. It's a sweet property.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then it isn't yours?\" she asked, turning round to him. It was an\r\n",
      "impulse of sympathy that made her look at him now, for she already knew\r\n",
      "how much he had the success of his newspaper at heart. He had once told\r\n",
      "her he loved the Reverberator as he had loved his first jack-knife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mine? You don't mean to say you suppose I own it!\" George Flack\r\n",
      "shouted. The light projected upon her innocence by his tone was so\r\n",
      "strong that the girl blushed, and he went on more tenderly: \"It's a\r\n",
      "pretty sight, the way you and your sister take that sort of thing for\r\n",
      "granted. Do you think property grows on you like a moustache? Well,\r\n",
      "it seems as if it had, on your father. If I owned the Reverberator I\r\n",
      "wouldn't be stumping round here; I'd give my attention to another branch\r\n",
      "of the business. That is I'd give my attention to all, but I wouldn't\r\n",
      "go round with the delivery-cart. Still, I'm going to capture the blamed\r\n",
      "thing, and I want you to help me,\" the young man went on; \"that's\r\n",
      "just what I wanted to speak to you about. It's a big proposition as it\r\n",
      "stands, but I mean to make it bigger: the most universal society-paper\r\n",
      "the world has seen. That's where the future lies, and the man who sees\r\n",
      "it first is the man who'll make his pile. It's a field for enlightened\r\n",
      "enterprise that hasn't yet begun to be worked.\" He continued, glowing\r\n",
      "as if on a sudden with his idea, and one of his knowing eyes half-closed\r\n",
      "itself for an emphasis habitual with him when he talked consecutively.\r\n",
      "The effect of this would have been droll to a listener, the note of the\r\n",
      "prospectus mingling with the question of his more intimate hope. But it\r\n",
      "was not droll to Francie; she only thought it, or supposed it, a proof\r\n",
      "of the way Mr. Flack saw everything on a stupendous scale. \"There are\r\n",
      "ten thousand things to do that haven't been done, and I'm going to do\r\n",
      "them. The society-news of every quarter of the globe, furnished by the\r\n",
      "prominent members themselves--oh THEY can be fixed, you'll see!--from\r\n",
      "day to day and from hour to hour and served up hot at every\r\n",
      "breakfast-table in the United States: that's what the American people\r\n",
      "want and that's what the American people are going to have. I wouldn't\r\n",
      "say it to every one, but I don't mind telling you, that I consider my\r\n",
      "guess as good as the next man's on what's going to be required in\r\n",
      "future over there. I'm going for the inside view, the choice bits, the\r\n",
      "chronique intime, as they say here; what the people want's just what\r\n",
      "ain't told, and I'm going to tell it. Oh they're bound to have the\r\n",
      "plums! That's about played out, anyway, the idea of sticking up a sign\r\n",
      "of 'private' and 'hands off' and 'no thoroughfare' and thinking you can\r\n",
      "keep the place to yourself. You ain't going to be able any longer to\r\n",
      "monopolise any fact of general interest, and it ain't going to be\r\n",
      "right you should; it ain't going to continue to be possible to keep out\r\n",
      "anywhere the light of the Press. Now what I'm going to do is to set up\r\n",
      "the biggest lamp yet made and make it shine all over the place. We'll\r\n",
      "see who's private then, and whose hands are off, and who'll frustrate\r\n",
      "the People--the People THAT WANTS TO KNOW. That's a sign of the American\r\n",
      "people that they DO want to know, and it's the sign of George P. Flack,\"\r\n",
      "the young man pursued with a rising spirit, \"that he's going to help\r\n",
      "them. But I'll make the touchy folks crowd in THEMSELVES with their\r\n",
      "information, and as I tell you, Miss Francie, it's a job in which you\r\n",
      "can give me a lovely lift.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I don't see how,\" said Francie candidly. \"I haven't got any\r\n",
      "choice bits or any facts of general interest.\" She spoke gaily because\r\n",
      "she was relieved; she thought she had in truth a glimpse of what he\r\n",
      "wanted of her. It was something better than she had feared. Since he\r\n",
      "didn't own the great newspaper--her view of such possibilities was of\r\n",
      "the dimmest--he desired to possess himself of it, and she sufficiently\r\n",
      "grasped the idea that money was needed for that. She further seemed to\r\n",
      "make out that he presented himself to her, that he hovered about her\r\n",
      "and pressed on her, as moneyless, and that this brought them round by\r\n",
      "a vague but comfortable transition to a helpful remembrance that her\r\n",
      "father was not. The remaining divination, silently achieved, was quick\r\n",
      "and happy: she should acquit herself by asking her father for the sum\r\n",
      "required and by just passing it on to Mr. Flack. The grandeur of his\r\n",
      "enterprise and the force of his reasoning appeared to overshadow her as\r\n",
      "they stood there. This was a delightful simplification and it didn't for\r\n",
      "the moment strike her as positively unnatural that her companion should\r\n",
      "have a delicacy about appealing to Mr. Dosson directly for financial\r\n",
      "aid, though indeed she would have been capable of thinking that odd had\r\n",
      "she meditated on it. There was nothing simpler to Francie than the idea\r\n",
      "of putting her hand into her father's pocket, and she felt that even\r\n",
      "Delia would be glad to appease their persecutor by this casual gesture.\r\n",
      "I must add unfortunately that her alarm came back to her from his look\r\n",
      "as he replied: \"Do you mean to say you don't know, after all I've done?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I don't know what you've done.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Haven't I tried--all I know--to make you like me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear, I do like you!\" cried Francie; \"but how will that help you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It will help me if you'll understand how I love you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I won't understand!\" replied the girl as she walked off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He followed her; they went on together in silence and then he said: \"Do\r\n",
      "you mean to say you haven't found that out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't find things out--I ain't an editor!\" Francie gaily quavered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You draw me out and then you gibe at me,\" Mr. Flack returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I didn't draw you out. Why, couldn't you see me just strain to get\r\n",
      "away?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you sympathise then with my ideas?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I do, Mr. Flack; I think your ideas splendid,\" said Francie,\r\n",
      "who hadn't in the least taken them in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then why won't you work with me? Your affection, your brightness,\r\n",
      "your faith--to say nothing of your matchless beauty--would be everything\r\n",
      "to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm very sorry, but I can't, I can't!\" she protested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You could if you would, quick enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then I won't!\" And as soon as these words were spoken, as if to\r\n",
      "mitigate something of their asperity, she made her other point. \"You\r\n",
      "must remember that I never said I would--nor anything like it; not one\r\n",
      "little wee mite. I thought you just wanted me to speak to poppa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I supposed you'd do that,\" he allowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean about your paper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About my paper?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So as he could give you the money--to do what you want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord, you're too sweet!\" George Flack cried with an illumined stare.\r\n",
      "\"Do you suppose I'd ever touch a cent of your father's money?\"--a speech\r\n",
      "not rankly hypocritical, inasmuch as the young man, who made his own\r\n",
      "discriminations, had never been guilty, and proposed to himself never\r\n",
      "to be, of the indelicacy of tugging at his potential father-in-law's\r\n",
      "purse-strings with his own hand. He had talked to Mr. Dosson by the hour\r\n",
      "about his master-plan of making the touchy folks themselves fall\r\n",
      "into line, but had never dreamed this man would subsidise him as an\r\n",
      "interesting struggler. The only character in which he could expect it\r\n",
      "would be that of Francie's accepted suitor, and then the liberality\r\n",
      "would have Francie and not himself for its object. This reasoning\r\n",
      "naturally didn't lessen his impatience to take on the happy character,\r\n",
      "so that his love of his profession and his appreciation of the girl at\r\n",
      "his side now ached together in his breast with the same disappointment.\r\n",
      "She saw that her words had touched him like a lash; they made him for a\r\n",
      "moment flush to his eyes. This caused her own colour to rise--she could\r\n",
      "scarcely have said why--and she hurried along again. He kept close to\r\n",
      "her; he argued with her; he besought her to think it over, assuring her\r\n",
      "he had brains, heart and material proofs of a college education. To this\r\n",
      "she replied that if he didn't leave her alone she should cry--and how\r\n",
      "would he like that, to bring her back in such a state to the others? He\r\n",
      "answered \"Damn the others!\" but it didn't help his case, and at last\r\n",
      "he broke out: \"Will you just tell me this, then--is it because you've\r\n",
      "promised Miss Delia?\" Francie returned that she hadn't promised Miss\r\n",
      "Delia anything, and her companion went on: \"Of course I know what she\r\n",
      "has got in her head: she wants to get you into the smart set--the grand\r\n",
      "monde, as they call it here; but I didn't suppose you'd let her fix your\r\n",
      "life for you. You were very different before HE turned up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She never fixed anything for me. I haven't got any life and I don't\r\n",
      "want to have any,\" Francie veraciously pleaded. \"And I don't know who\r\n",
      "you're talking about either!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The man without a country. HE'LL pass you in--that's what your sister\r\n",
      "wants.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You oughtn't to abuse him, because it was you that presented him,\" the\r\n",
      "girl pronounced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I never presented him! I'd like to kick him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We should never have seen him if it hadn't been for you,\" she\r\n",
      "maintained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's a fact, but it doesn't make me love him any better. He's the\r\n",
      "poorest kind there is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't care anything about his kind.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's a pity if you're going to marry him right off! How could I know\r\n",
      "that when I took you up there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Mr. Flack,\" said Francie, trying to gain ground from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This attempt was of course vain, and after a moment he resumed: \"Will\r\n",
      "you keep me as a friend?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why Mr. Flack, OF COURSE I will!\" cried the easy creature.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Gaston Probert made his plan, confiding it only to his friend Waterlow\r\n",
      "whose help indeed he needed to carry it out. These revelations cost him\r\n",
      "something, for the ornament of the merciless school, as it might have\r\n",
      "been called, found his predicament amusing and made no scruple of\r\n",
      "showing it. Gaston was too much in love, however, to be upset by a bad\r\n",
      "joke or two. This fact is the more noteworthy as he knew that Waterlow\r\n",
      "scoffed at him for a purpose--had a view of the good to be done him\r\n",
      "by throwing him on the defensive. The French tradition, or a grimacing\r\n",
      "ghost of it, was in Waterlow's \"manner,\" but it had not made its mark\r\n",
      "on his view of the relations of a young man of spirit with parents and\r\n",
      "pastors. He mixed his colours, as might have been said, with the general\r\n",
      "sense of France, but his early American immunities and serenities could\r\n",
      "still swell his sail in any \"vital\" discussion with a friend in whose\r\n",
      "life the principle of authority played so large a part. He accused\r\n",
      "Probert of being afraid of his sisters, which was an effective way--and\r\n",
      "he knew it--of alluding to the rigidity of the conception of the family\r\n",
      "among people who had adopted and had even to Waterlow's sense, as the\r\n",
      "phrase is, improved upon the \"Latin\" ideal. That did injustice--and this\r\n",
      "the artist also knew--to the delicate nature of the bond uniting the\r\n",
      "different members of the house of Probert, who were each for all and all\r\n",
      "for each. Family feeling among them was not a tyranny but a religion,\r\n",
      "and in regard to Mesdames de Brecourt, de Cliche and de Douves what\r\n",
      "Gaston most feared was that he might seem to them not to love them\r\n",
      "enough. None the less Charles Waterlow, who thought he had charming\r\n",
      "parts, held that the best way hadn't been taken to make a man of him,\r\n",
      "and the zeal with which the painter appeared to have proposed to repair\r\n",
      "that mistake was founded in esteem, though it sometimes flowered in\r\n",
      "freedom. Waterlow combined in odd fashion many of the forms of the\r\n",
      "Parisian studio with the moral and social ideas of Brooklyn Long Island,\r\n",
      "where the seeds of his strictness had been sown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaston Probert desired nothing better than to be a man; what worried\r\n",
      "him--and it is perhaps a proof that his instinct was gravely at\r\n",
      "fault--was a certain vagueness as to the constituents of that character.\r\n",
      "He should approximate more nearly, as it seemed to him, to the brute\r\n",
      "were he to sacrifice in such an effort the decencies and pieties--holy\r\n",
      "things all of them--in which he had been reared. It was very well for\r\n",
      "Waterlow to say that to be a \"real\" man it was necessary to be a little\r\n",
      "of a brute; his friend was willing, in theory, to assent even to that.\r\n",
      "The difficulty was in application, in practice--as to which the painter\r\n",
      "declared that all would be easy if such account hadn't to be taken of\r\n",
      "the marquise, the comtesse and--what was the other one?--the princess.\r\n",
      "These young amenities were exchanged between the pair--while Gaston\r\n",
      "explained, almost as eagerly as if he were scoring a point, that the\r\n",
      "other one was only a baronne--during that brief journey to Spain of\r\n",
      "which mention has already been made, during the later weeks of the\r\n",
      "summer, after their return (the friends then spent a fortnight together\r\n",
      "on the coast of Brittany), and above all during the autumn, when they\r\n",
      "were settled in Paris for the winter, when Mr. Dosson had reappeared,\r\n",
      "according to the engagement with his daughters, when the sittings for\r\n",
      "the portrait had multiplied (the painter was unscrupulous as to the\r\n",
      "number he demanded), and the work itself, born under a happy star,\r\n",
      "seemed to take more and more the turn of a great thing. It was at\r\n",
      "Granada that Gaston had really broken out; there, one balmy night, he\r\n",
      "had dropped into his comrade's ear that he would marry Francina Dosson\r\n",
      "or would never marry at all. The declaration was the more striking as\r\n",
      "it had come after such an interval; many days had elapsed since their\r\n",
      "separation from the young lady and many new and beautiful objects\r\n",
      "appealed to them. It appeared that the smitten youth had been thinking\r\n",
      "of her all the while, and he let his friend know that it was the dinner\r\n",
      "at Saint-Germain that had finished him. What she had been there Waterlow\r\n",
      "himself had seen: he wouldn't controvert the lucid proposition that she\r\n",
      "showed a \"cutting\" equal to any Greek gem.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In November, in Paris--it was months and weeks before the artist began\r\n",
      "to please himself--Gaston came often to the Avenue de Villiers toward\r\n",
      "the end of a sitting and, till it was finished, not to disturb the\r\n",
      "lovely model, cultivated conversation with the elder sister: the\r\n",
      "representative of the Proberts was capable of that. Delia was always\r\n",
      "there of course, but Mr. Dosson had not once turned up and the\r\n",
      "newspaper-man happily appeared to have faded from view. The new aspirant\r\n",
      "learned in fact from Miss Dosson that a crisis in the history of his\r\n",
      "journal had recalled Mr. Flack to the seat of that publication. When the\r\n",
      "young ladies had gone--and when he didn't go with them; he accompanied\r\n",
      "them not rarely--the visitor was almost lyrical in his appreciation of\r\n",
      "his friend's work; he had no jealousy of the act of appropriation that\r\n",
      "rendered possible in its turn such an act of handing over, of which the\r\n",
      "canvas constituted the field. He was sure Waterlow painted the girl too\r\n",
      "well to be in love with her and that if he himself could have dealt with\r\n",
      "her in that fashion he mightn't have wanted to deal in any other. She\r\n",
      "bloomed there on the easel with all the purity of life, and the artist\r\n",
      "had caught the very secret of her beauty. It was exactly the way in\r\n",
      "which her lover would have chosen to see her shown, and yet it had\r\n",
      "required a perfectly independent hand. Gaston mused on this mystery and\r\n",
      "somehow felt proud of the picture and responsible for it, though it\r\n",
      "was no more his property as yet than the young lady herself. When in\r\n",
      "December he put before Waterlow his plan of campaign the latter made\r\n",
      "a comment. \"I'll do anything in the world you like--anything you think\r\n",
      "will help you--but it passes me, my dear fellow, why in the world you\r\n",
      "don't go to them and say: 'I've seen a girl who is as good as cake and\r\n",
      "pretty as fire, she exactly suits me, I've taken time to think of it\r\n",
      "and I know what I want; therefore I propose to make her my wife. If you\r\n",
      "happen to like her so much the better; if you don't be so good as to\r\n",
      "keep it to yourselves.' That's much the most excellent way. Why in the\r\n",
      "name of goodness all these mysteries and machinations?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you don't understand, you don't understand!\" sighed Gaston, who had\r\n",
      "never pulled so long a face. \"One can't break with one's traditions\r\n",
      "in an hour, especially when there's so much in them that one likes. I\r\n",
      "shan't love her more if they like her, but I shall love THEM more, and\r\n",
      "I care about that. You talk as a man who has nothing to consider. I've\r\n",
      "everything to consider--and I'm glad I have. My pleasure in marrying\r\n",
      "her will be double if my father and my sisters accept her, and I shall\r\n",
      "greatly enjoy working out the business of bringing them round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were moments when Charles Waterlow resented the very vocabulary\r\n",
      "of his friend; he hated to hear a man talk about the \"acceptance\" by any\r\n",
      "one but himself of the woman he loved. One's own acceptance--of one's\r\n",
      "bliss--in such a case ended the matter, and the effort to bring round\r\n",
      "those who gave her the cold shoulder was scarcely consistent with the\r\n",
      "highest spirit. Young Probert explained that of course he felt his\r\n",
      "relatives would only have to know Francina to like her, to delight\r\n",
      "in her, yet also that to know her they would first have to make her\r\n",
      "acquaintance. This was the delicate point, for social commerce with such\r\n",
      "malheureux as Mr. Dosson and Delia was not in the least in their\r\n",
      "usual line and it was impossible to disconnect the poor girl from\r\n",
      "her appendages. Therefore the whole question must be approached by an\r\n",
      "oblique movement--it would never do to march straight up. The wedge\r\n",
      "should have a narrow end, which Gaston now made sure he had found. His\r\n",
      "sister Susan was another name for this subtle engine; he would break\r\n",
      "her in first and she would help him to break in the others. She was\r\n",
      "his favourite relation, his intimate friend--the most modern, the most\r\n",
      "Parisian and inflammable member of the family. She had no suite dans\r\n",
      "les idees, but she had perceptions, had imagination and humour, and was\r\n",
      "capable of generosity, of enthusiasm and even of blind infatuation. She\r\n",
      "had in fact taken two or three plunges of her own and ought to allow for\r\n",
      "those of others. She wouldn't like the Dossons superficially any better\r\n",
      "than his father or than Margaret or than Jane--he called these ladies by\r\n",
      "their English names, but for themselves, their husbands, their friends\r\n",
      "and each other they were Suzanne, Marguerite and Jeanne; but there was\r\n",
      "a good chance of his gaining her to his side. She was as fond of\r\n",
      "beauty and of the arts as he--this was one of their bonds of union. She\r\n",
      "appreciated highly Charles Waterlow's talent and there had been talk of\r\n",
      "her deciding to sit to him. It was true her husband viewed the project\r\n",
      "with so much colder an eye that it had not been carried out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "According to Gaston's plan she was to come to the Avenue de Villiers to\r\n",
      "see what the artist had done for Miss Francie; her brother was to have\r\n",
      "worked upon her in advance by his careful rhapsodies, bearing wholly on\r\n",
      "the achievement itself, the dazzling example of Waterlow's powers, and\r\n",
      "not on the young lady, whom he was not to let her know at first that he\r\n",
      "had so much as seen. Just at the last, just before her visit, he was to\r\n",
      "mention to her that he had met the girl--at the studio--and that she was\r\n",
      "as remarkable in her way as the picture. Seeing the picture and\r\n",
      "hearing this, Mme. de Brecourt, as a disinterested lover of charming\r\n",
      "impressions, and above all as an easy prey at all times to a rabid\r\n",
      "curiosity, would express a desire also to enjoy a sight of so rare a\r\n",
      "creature; on which Waterlow might pronounce it all arrangeable if she\r\n",
      "would but come in some day when Miss Francie should sit. He would give\r\n",
      "her two or three dates and Gaston would see that she didn't let the\r\n",
      "opportunity pass. She would return alone--this time he wouldn't go with\r\n",
      "her--and she would be as taken as could be hoped or needed. Everything\r\n",
      "much depended on that, but it couldn't fail. The girl would have to take\r\n",
      "her, but the girl could be trusted, especially if she didn't know who\r\n",
      "the demonstrative French lady was, with her fine plain face, her hair\r\n",
      "so blond as to be nearly white, her vividly red lips and protuberant\r\n",
      "light-coloured eyes. Their host was to do no introducing and to reveal\r\n",
      "the visitor's identity only after she had gone. That was a condition\r\n",
      "indeed this participant grumbled at; he called the whole business an\r\n",
      "odious comedy, though his friend knew that if he undertook it he\r\n",
      "would acquit himself honourably. After Mme. de Brecourt had been\r\n",
      "captivated--the question of how Francie would be affected received\r\n",
      "in advance no consideration--her brother would throw off the mask and\r\n",
      "convince her that she must now work with him. Another meeting would be\r\n",
      "managed for her with the girl--in which each would appear in her proper\r\n",
      "character; and in short the plot would thicken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaston's forecast of his difficulties showed how finely he could\r\n",
      "analyse; but that was not rare enough in any French connexion to make\r\n",
      "his friend stare. He brought Suzanne de Brecourt, she was enchanted with\r\n",
      "the portrait of the little American, and the rest of the drama began to\r\n",
      "follow in its order. Mme. de Brecourt raved to Waterlow's face--she had\r\n",
      "no opinions behind people's backs--about his mastery of his craft; she\r\n",
      "could dispose the floral tributes of homage with a hand of practice all\r\n",
      "her own. She was the reverse of egotistic and never spoke of herself;\r\n",
      "her success in life sprang from a much wiser adoption of pronouns.\r\n",
      "Waterlow, who liked her and had long wanted to paint her ugliness--it\r\n",
      "was a gold-mine of charm--had two opinions about her: one of which was\r\n",
      "that she knew a hundred times less than she thought, and even than her\r\n",
      "brother thought, of what she talked about; and the other that she was\r\n",
      "after all not such a humbug as she seemed. She passed in her family\r\n",
      "for a rank radical, a bold Bohemian; she picked up expressions out\r\n",
      "of newspapers and at the petits theatres, but her hands and feet were\r\n",
      "celebrated, and her behaviour was not. That of her sisters, as well, had\r\n",
      "never been disastrously exposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But she must be charming, your young lady,\" she said to Gaston while\r\n",
      "she turned her head this way and that as she stood before Francie's\r\n",
      "image. \"She's a little Renaissance statuette cast in silver, something\r\n",
      "of Jean Goujon or Germain Pilon.\" The young men exchanged a glance, for\r\n",
      "this struck them as the happiest comparison, and Gaston replied in a\r\n",
      "detached way that the girl was well worth seeing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went in to have a cup of tea with his sister on the day he knew she\r\n",
      "would have paid her second visit to the studio, and the first words she\r\n",
      "greeted him with were: \"But she's admirable--votre petite--admirable,\r\n",
      "admirable!\" There was a lady calling in the Place Beauvau at the\r\n",
      "moment--old Mme. d'Outreville--who naturally asked for news of the\r\n",
      "object of such enthusiasm. Gaston suffered Susan to answer all questions\r\n",
      "and was attentive to her account of the new beauty. She described his\r\n",
      "young friend almost as well as he would have done, from the point of\r\n",
      "view of her type, her graces, her plastic value, using various technical\r\n",
      "and critical terms to which the old lady listened in silence, solemnly,\r\n",
      "rather coldly, as if she thought such talk much of a galimatias:\r\n",
      "she belonged to the old-fashioned school and held a pretty person\r\n",
      "sufficiently catalogued when it had been said she had a dazzling\r\n",
      "complexion or the finest eyes in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette merveille?\" she enquired; to which Mme.\r\n",
      "de Brecourt made answer that it was a little American her brother had\r\n",
      "somewhere dug up. \"And what do you propose to do with it, may one ask?\"\r\n",
      "Mme. d'Outreville demanded, looking at Gaston with an eye that seemed to\r\n",
      "read his secret and that brought him for half a minute to the point of\r\n",
      "breaking out: \"I propose to marry it--there!\" But he contained himself,\r\n",
      "only pleading for the present his wish to ascertain the uses to which\r\n",
      "she was adapted; meanwhile, he added, there was nothing he so much liked\r\n",
      "as to look at her, in the measure in which she would allow him. \"Ah\r\n",
      "that may take you far!\" their visitor cried as she got up to go; and the\r\n",
      "young man glanced at his sister to see if she too were ironic. But she\r\n",
      "seemed almost awkwardly free from alarm; if she had been suspicious it\r\n",
      "would have been easier to make his confession. When he came back from\r\n",
      "accompanying their old friend Outreville to her carriage he asked her\r\n",
      "if Waterlow's charming sitter had known who she was and if she had been\r\n",
      "frightened. Mme. de Brecourt stared; she evidently thought that kind\r\n",
      "of sensibility implied an initiation--and into dangers--which a little\r\n",
      "American accidentally encountered couldn't possibly have. \"Why should\r\n",
      "she be frightened? She wouldn't be even if she had known who I was; much\r\n",
      "less therefore when I was nothing for her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you weren't nothing for her!\" the brooding youth declared; and when\r\n",
      "his sister rejoined that he was trop aimable he brought out his lurking\r\n",
      "fact. He had seen the lovely creature more often than he had mentioned;\r\n",
      "he had particularly wished that SHE should see her. Now he wanted his\r\n",
      "father and Jane and Margaret to do the same, and above all he wanted\r\n",
      "them to like her even as she, Susan, liked her. He was delighted she\r\n",
      "had been taken--he had been so taken himself. Mme. de Brecourt protested\r\n",
      "that she had reserved her independence of judgement, and he answered\r\n",
      "that if she thought Miss Dosson repulsive he might have expressed it in\r\n",
      "another way. When she begged him to tell her what he was talking about\r\n",
      "and what he wanted them all to do with the child he said: \"I want you\r\n",
      "to treat her kindly, tenderly, for such as you see her I'm thinking of\r\n",
      "bringing her into the family.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mercy on us--you haven't proposed for her?\" cried Mme. de Brecourt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, but I've sounded her sister as to THEIR dispositions, and she tells\r\n",
      "me that if I present myself there will be no difficulty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her sister?--the awful little woman with the big head?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her head's rather out of drawing, but it isn't a part of the affair.\r\n",
      "She's very inoffensive; she would be devoted to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake then keep quiet. She's as common as a dressmaker's\r\n",
      "bill.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not when you know her. Besides, that has nothing to do with Francie.\r\n",

      "first supposed him to have missed a customary dish from the board, but\r\n",
      "recognised the next moment his usual designation of his daughters. These\r\n",
      "young ladies presently came in, but Francie looked away from the suitor\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"If you say that again I shall think you do it on purpose!\" Delia\r\n",
      "declared. \"ARE you thinking of George Flack?\" she repeated in a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh do leave him alone!\" Francie answered in one of her rare\r\n",
      "irritations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why are you so queer?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'm tired!\"--and the girl turned impatiently away. And this was the\r\n",
      "simple truth; she was tired of the consideration her sister saw fit to\r\n",
      "devote to the question of Gaston's not having, since their return to\r\n",
      "Paris, brought the old folks, as they used to say at home, to see them.\r\n",
      "She was overdone with Delia's theories on this subject, which varied,\r\n",
      "from the view that he was keeping his intercourse with his American\r\n",
      "friends unguessed by them because they were uncompromising in their\r\n",
      "grandeur, to the presumption that that grandeur would descend some day\r\n",
      "upon the Hotel de l'Univers et de Cheltenham and carry Francie away in a\r\n",
      "blaze of glory. Sometimes Delia played in her earnest way with the idea\r\n",
      "that they ought to make certain of Gaston's omissions the ground of a\r\n",
      "challenge; at other times she gave her reasons for judging that they\r\n",
      "ought to take no notice of them. Francie, in this connexion, had neither\r\n",
      "doctrine nor instinct of her own; and now she was all at once happy and\r\n",
      "uneasy, all at once in love and in doubt and in fear and in a state\r\n",
      "of native indifference. Her lover had dwelt to her but little on his\r\n",
      "domestic circle, and she had noticed this circumstance the more because\r\n",
      "of a remark dropped by Charles Waterlow to the effect that he and\r\n",
      "his father were great friends: the word seemed to her odd in that\r\n",
      "application. She knew he saw that gentleman and the types of high\r\n",
      "fashion, as she supposed, Mr. Probert's daughters, very often, and she\r\n",
      "therefore took for granted that they knew he saw her. But the most he\r\n",
      "had done was to say they would come and see her like a shot if once\r\n",
      "they should believe they could trust her. She had wanted to know what he\r\n",
      "meant by their trusting her, and he had explained that it would seem\r\n",
      "to them too good to be true--that she should be kind to HIM: something\r\n",
      "exactly of that sort was what they dreamed of for him. But they had\r\n",
      "dreamed before and been disappointed and were now on their guard. From\r\n",
      "the moment they should feel they were on solid ground they would join\r\n",
      "hands and dance round her. Francie's answer to this ingenuity was that\r\n",
      "she didn't know what he was talking about, and he indulged in no attempt\r\n",
      "on that occasion to render his meaning more clear; the consequence of\r\n",
      "which was that he felt he bore as yet with an insufficient mass, he cut,\r\n",
      "to be plain, a poor figure. His uneasiness had not passed away, for\r\n",
      "many things in truth were dark to him. He couldn't see his father\r\n",
      "fraternising with Mr. Dosson, he couldn't see Margaret and Jane\r\n",
      "recognising an alliance in which Delia was one of the allies. He had\r\n",
      "answered for them because that was the only thing to do, and this only\r\n",
      "just failed to be criminally reckless. What saved it was the hope he\r\n",
      "founded upon Mme. de Brecourt and the sense of how well he could answer\r\n",
      "to the others for Francie. He considered that Susan had in her first\r\n",
      "judgement of his young lady committed herself; she had really taken her\r\n",
      "in, and her subsequent protest when she found what was in his heart\r\n",
      "had been a denial which he would make her in turn deny. The girl's slow\r\n",
      "sweetness once acting, she would come round. A simple interview with\r\n",
      "Francie would suffice for this result--by the end of half an hour she\r\n",
      "should be an enthusiastic convert. By the end of an hour she would\r\n",
      "believe she herself had invented the match--had discovered the pearl.\r\n",
      "He would pack her off to the others as the author of the plan; she would\r\n",
      "take it all upon herself, would represent him even as hanging a little\r\n",
      "back. SHE would do nothing of that sort, but would boast of her superior\r\n",
      "flair, and would so enjoy the comedy as to forget she had resisted him\r\n",
      "even a moment. The young man had a high sense of honour but was ready in\r\n",
      "this forecast for fifty fibs.\r\n",

      "dropped her charge this critic rushed off to her father's, reflecting\r\n",
      "with pleasure that at that hour she should probably find her sister\r\n",

      "supposed, Mme. de Brecourt knew what Marguerite did whenever she took\r\n",
      "that little ottoman and drew it close to the paternal chair: she gave\r\n",
      "way to her favourite vice, that of dolefulness, which lengthened her\r\n",
      "long face more: it was unbecoming if she only knew it. The family was\r\n",

      "having a certain sympathy for Maxime: he too was one of themselves,\r\n",
      "and she asked herself what SHE would have done had she been a\r\n",
      "well-constituted man with a wife whose cheeks were like decks in a high\r\n",
      "sea. It was the twilight hour in the winter days, before the lamps, that\r\n",
      "especially brought her out; then she began her long stories about her\r\n",
      "complicated cares, to which her father listened with angelic patience.\r\n",
      "Mme. de Brecourt liked his particular room in the old house in the Cours\r\n",
      "la Reine; it reminded her of her mother's life and her young days and\r\n",
      "her dead brother and the feelings connected with her first going into\r\n",

      "kindness, under the roof that covered in associations as the door of a\r\n",
      "linen-closet preserves herbaceous scents, so that she continued to pop\r\n",
      "in and out, full of her fresh impressions of society, just as she had\r\n",
      "done when she was a girl. She broke into her sister's confidences now;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Five days later--there had been lively work in the meantime; Gaston\r\n",
      "turned so pale at moments that she feared it would all result in a\r\n",
      "mortal illness for him, and Marguerite shed gallons of tears--Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert went to see the Dossons with his son. Mme. de Brecourt paid them\r\n",
      "another visit, a real official affair as she deemed it, accompanied by\r\n",
      "her husband; and the Baron de Douves and his wife, written to by Gaston,\r\n",
      "by his father and by Margaret and Susan, came up from the country full\r\n",
      "of anxious participation. M. de Douves was the person who took the\r\n",
      "family, all round, most seriously and who most deprecated any sign of\r\n",
      "crude or precipitate action. He was a very small black gentleman with\r\n",
      "thick eyebrows and high heels--in the country and the mud he wore sabots\r\n",
      "with straw in them--who was suspected by his friends of believing that\r\n",
      "he looked like Louis XIV. It is perhaps a proof that something of the\r\n",
      "quality of this monarch was really recognised in him that no one had\r\n",
      "ever ventured to clear up this point by a question. \"La famille c'est\r\n",
      "moi\" appeared to be his tacit formula, and he carried his umbrella--he\r\n",
      "had very bad ones, Gaston thought--with something of a sceptral\r\n",
      "air. Mme. de Brecourt went so far as to believe that his wife, in\r\n",
      "confirmation of this, took herself for a species of Mme. de Maintenon:\r\n",
      "she had lapsed into a provincial existence as she might have harked back\r\n",
      "to the seventeenth century; the world she lived in seemed about as far\r\n",
      "away. She was the largest, heaviest member of the family, and in the\r\n",
      "Vendee was thought majestic despite the old clothes she fondly affected\r\n",
      "and which added to her look of having come down from a remote past or\r\n",
      "reverted to it. She was at bottom an excellent woman, but she wrote\r\n",
      "roy and foy like her husband, and the action of her mind was wholly\r\n",
      "restricted to questions of relationship and alliance. She had\r\n",
      "extraordinary patience of research and tenacity of grasp for a clue, and\r\n",
      "viewed people solely in the light projected upon them by others; that\r\n",
      "is not as good or wicked, ugly or handsome, wise or foolish, but as\r\n",
      "grandsons, nephews, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters-in-law,\r\n",
      "cousins and second cousins. You might have supposed, to listen to\r\n",
      "her, that human beings were susceptible of no attribute but that of a\r\n",
      "dwindling or thickening consanguinity. There was a certain expectation\r\n",
      "that she would leave rather formidable memoirs. In Mme. de Brecourt's\r\n",

      "pure, and any one with an eye would see it.\" \"The thing\" was the\r\n",

      "The Marquis de Cliche did his duty with his wife, who mopped the decks,\r\n",
      "as Susan said, for the occasion, and was entertained in the red-satin\r\n",
      "drawing-room by Mr. Dosson, Delia and Francie. Mr. Dosson had wanted and\r\n",
      "proposed to be somewhere else when he heard of the approach of Gaston's\r\n",
      "relations, and the fond youth had to instruct him that this wouldn't do.\r\n",
      "The apartment in question had had a range of vision, but had probably\r\n",
      "never witnessed stranger doings than these laudable social efforts.\r\n",
      "Gaston was taught to feel that his family had made a great sacrifice for\r\n",
      "him, but in a very few days he said to himself that now they knew the\r\n",
      "worst he was safe. They made the sacrifice, they definitely agreed to\r\n",

      "which he was absent. These high commissions sat for several days with\r\n",
      "great frequency, and the young man could feel that if there was help for\r\n",
      "him in discussion his case was promising. He flattered himself that he\r\n",
      "showed infinite patience and tact, and his expenditure of the latter\r\n",
      "quality in particular was in itself his only reward, for it was\r\n",
      "impossible he should tell Francie what arts he had to practise for her.\r\n",
      "He liked to think however that he practised them successfully; for he\r\n",
      "held that it was by such arts the civilised man is distinguished from\r\n",
      "the savage. What they cost him was made up simply in this--that his\r\n",
      "private irritation produced a degree of adoptive heat in regard to Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson and Delia, whom he could neither justify nor coherently account\r\n",
      "for nor make people like, but whom he had ended after so many days of\r\n",
      "familiar intercourse by liking extremely himself. The way to get on with\r\n",
      "them--it was an immense simplification--was just to love them: one could\r\n",

      "inflammability. \"Yes,\" she said, \"we must insist on their positive, not\r\n",

      "their intensely native and instinctive delicacy. Ah their charming\r\n",
      "primitive instincts--we must work those!\" And the brother and sister\r\n",
      "excited each other magnanimously to this undertaking. Sometimes, it must\r\n",

      "On the day Mr. Probert called at the Hotel de l'Univers et de Cheltenham\r\n",
      "with his son the pair walked away together, back to the Cours la Reine,\r\n",
      "without immediate comments. The only words uttered were three or four of\r\n",

      "father's conditional, as if his assent to the strange alliance were not\r\n",
      "yet complete; but he guessed all the same that the sight of them had\r\n",
      "not made a difference for the worse: they had let the old gentleman down\r\n",
      "more easily than was to have been feared. The call had had above all the\r\n",
      "immense luck that it hadn't been noisy--a confusion of underbred sounds;\r\n",
      "which was very happy, for Mr. Probert was particular in this: he could\r\n",
      "bear French noise but couldn't for the life of him bear American. As\r\n",
      "for English he maintained that there was no such thing: England was a\r\n",
      "country with the straw down in all the thoroughfares of talk. Mr. Dosson\r\n",
      "had scarcely spoken and yet had remained perfectly placid, which was\r\n",

      "father's arm. It promised well; it made the intelligent, the tender\r\n",
      "allowance for the dear little Dossons confronted with a row of fierce\r\n",
      "French critics, judged by standards they had never even heard of. The\r\n",
      "meeting of the two parents had not made the problem of their commerce\r\n",
      "any more clear; but our youth was reminded afresh by his elder's hinted\r\n",
      "pity, his breathed charity, of the latent liberality that was really\r\n",
      "what he had built on. The dear old governor, goodness knew, had\r\n",
      "prejudices and superstitions, but if they were numerous, and some\r\n",
      "of them very curious, they were not rigid. He had also such nice\r\n",
      "inconsistent feelings, such irrepressible indulgences, such humorous\r\n",
      "deviations, and they would ease everything off. He was in short an old\r\n",
      "darling, and with an old darling in the long run one was always safe.\r\n",

      "reflexion was highly agreeable, for Gaston perfectly knew how little he\r\n",

      "but he couldn't bear to think of that, and the sense of the further\r\n",
      "arguments he was spared made him feel at peace with all the world. The\r\n",

      "been artlessly and gushingly glad to make their acquaintance. They had\r\n",
      "not in the least seen what was manner, the minimum of decent profession,\r\n",
      "and what the subtle resignation of old races who have known a long\r\n",
      "historical discipline and have conventional forms and tortuous channels\r\n",
      "and grimacing masks for their impulses--forms resembling singularly\r\n",

      "a frame too big and too heavy for it, and who therefore might have taken\r\n",
      "for granted any amount of gilding, yet made his reflexions on it now;\r\n",
      "he noticed how a manner might be a very misleading symbol, might cover\r\n",
      "pitfalls and bottomless gulfs, when it had reached that perfection and\r\n",
      "corresponded so little to fact. What he had wanted was that his people\r\n",
      "should be as easy as they could see their way to being, but with such a\r\n",
      "high standard of compliment where after all was sincerity? And without\r\n",
      "sincerity how could people get on together when it came to their\r\n",
      "settling down to common life? Then the Dossons might have surprises, and\r\n",
      "the surprises would be painful in proportion as their present innocence\r\n",
      "was great. As to the high standard itself there was no manner of doubt:\r\n",
      "there ought to be preserved examples of that perfection.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When on coming home again this evening, meanwhile, he complied with\r\n",
      "his father's request by returning to the room in which the old man\r\n",
      "habitually sat, Mr. Probert laid down his book and kept on his glasses.\r\n",
      "\"Of course you'll continue to live with me. You'll understand that I\r\n",
      "don't consent to your going away. You'll have the rooms occupied at\r\n",
      "first by Susan and Alphonse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaston noted with pleasure the transition from the conditional to the\r\n",
      "future tense, and also the circumstance that his father had been lost\r\n",
      "in a book according to his now confirmed custom of evening ease. This\r\n",
      "proved him not too much off the hinge. He read a great deal, and\r\n",
      "very serious books; works about the origin of things--of man, of\r\n",
      "institutions, of speech, of religion. This habit he had taken up more\r\n",
      "particularly since the circle of his social life had contracted. He sat\r\n",
      "there alone, turning his pages softly, contentedly, with the lamplight\r\n",
      "shining on his refined old head and embroidered dressing-gown. He had\r\n",
      "used of old to be out every night in the week--Gaston was perfectly\r\n",
      "aware that to many dull people he must even have appeared a little\r\n",
      "frivolous. He was essentially a social creature and indeed--except\r\n",
      "perhaps poor Jane in her damp old castle in Brittany--they were all\r\n",
      "social creatures. That was doubtless part of the reason why the family\r\n",
      "had acclimatised itself in France. They had affinities with a society\r\n",
      "of conversation; they liked general talk and old high salons, slightly\r\n",
      "tarnished and dim, containing precious relics, where winged words flew\r\n",
      "about through a circle round the fire and some clever person, before the\r\n",
      "chimney-piece, held or challenged the others. That figure, Gaston knew,\r\n",
      "especially in the days before he could see for himself, had very often\r\n",
      "been his father, the lightest and most amiable specimen of the type that\r\n",
      "enjoyed easy possession of the hearth-rug. People left it to him; he was\r\n",
      "so transparent, like a glass screen, and he never triumphed in debate.\r\n",
      "His word on most subjects was not felt to be the last (it was usually\r\n",
      "not more conclusive than a shrugging inarticulate resignation, an \"Ah\r\n",
      "you know, what will you have?\"); but he had been none the less a part\r\n",
      "of the very prestige of some dozen good houses, most of them over\r\n",
      "the river, in the conservative faubourg, and several to-day profaned\r\n",
      "shrines, cold and desolate hearths. These had made up Mr. Probert's\r\n",
      "pleasant world--a world not too small for him and yet not too large,\r\n",
      "though some of them supposed themselves great institutions. Gaston knew\r\n",
      "the succession of events that had helped to make a difference, the most\r\n",
      "salient of which were the death of his brother, the death of his mother,\r\n",
      "and above all perhaps the demise of Mme. de Marignac, to whom the\r\n",
      "old boy used still to go three or four evenings out of the seven and\r\n",
      "sometimes even in the morning besides. Gaston fully measured the place\r\n",
      "she had held in his father's life and affection, and the terms on\r\n",
      "which they had grown up together--her people had been friends of his\r\n",
      "grandfather when that fine old Southern worthy came, a widower with a\r\n",
      "young son and several negroes, to take his pleasure in Paris in the time\r\n",
      "of Louis Philippe--and the devoted part she had played in marrying his\r\n",
      "sisters. He was quite aware that her friendship and all its exertions\r\n",
      "were often mentioned as explaining their position, so remarkable in a\r\n",
      "society in which they had begun after all as outsiders. But he would\r\n",
      "have guessed, even if he had not been told, what his father said\r\n",
      "to that. To offer the Proberts a position was to carry water to the\r\n",
      "fountain; they hadn't left their own behind them in Carolina; it had\r\n",
      "been large enough to stretch across the sea. As to what it was in\r\n",
      "Carolina there was no need of being explicit. This adoptive Parisian was\r\n",
      "by nature presupposing, but he was admirably urbane--that was why they\r\n",
      "let him talk so before the fire; he was the oracle persuasive, the\r\n",
      "conciliatory voice--and after the death of his wife and of Mme. de\r\n",
      "Marignac, who had been her friend too, the young man's mother's, he was\r\n",
      "gentler, if more detached, than before. Gaston had already felt him\r\n",
      "to care in consequence less for everything--except indeed for the true\r\n",
      "faith, to which he drew still closer--and this increase of indifference\r\n",
      "doubtless helped to explain his present charming accommodation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall be thankful for any rooms you may give us,\" his son said.\r\n",
      "\"We shall fill out the house a little, and won't that be rather an\r\n",
      "improvement, shrunken as you and I have become?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll fill it out a good deal, I suppose, with Mr. Dosson and the\r\n",
      "other girl.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah Francie won't give up her father and sister, certainly; and what\r\n",
      "should you think of her if she did? But they're not intrusive; they're\r\n",
      "essentially modest people; they won't put themselves upon us. They have\r\n",
      "great natural discretion,\" Gaston declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you answer for that? Susan does; she's always assuring one of it,\"\r\n",
      "Mr. Probert said. \"The father has so much that he wouldn't even speak to\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He didn't, poor dear man, know what to say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How then shall I know what to say to HIM?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you always know!\" Gaston smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How will that help us if he doesn't know what to answer?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll draw him out. He's full of a funny little shade of bonhomie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I won't quarrel with your bonhomme,\" said Mr. Probert--\"if he's\r\n",
      "silent there are much worse faults; nor yet with the fat young lady,\r\n",
      "though she's evidently vulgar--even if you call it perhaps too a funny\r\n",
      "little shade. It's not for ourselves I'm afraid; it's for them. They'll\r\n",
      "be very unhappy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never, never!\" said Gaston. \"They're too simple. They'll remain so.\r\n",
      "They're not morbid nor suspicious. And don't you like Francie? You\r\n",
      "haven't told me so,\" he added in a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She talks about 'Parus,' my dear boy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah to Susan too that seemed the great barrier. But she has got over it.\r\n",
      "I mean Susan has got over the barrier. We shall make her speak French;\r\n",
      "she has a real disposition for it; her French is already almost as good\r\n",
      "as her English.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That oughtn't to be difficult. What will you have? Of course she's very\r\n",
      "pretty and I'm sure she's good. But I won't tell you she is a marvel,\r\n",
      "because you must remember--you young fellows think your own point of\r\n",
      "view and your own experience everything--that I've seen beauties without\r\n",
      "number. I've known the most charming women of our time--women of an\r\n",
      "order to which Miss Francie, con rispetto parlando, will never begin to\r\n",
      "belong. I'm difficult about women--how can I help it? Therefore when\r\n",
      "you pick up a little American girl at an inn and bring her to us as\r\n",
      "a miracle, feel how standards alter. J'ai vu mieux que ca, mon cher.\r\n",
      "However, I accept everything to-day, as you know; when once one has lost\r\n",
      "one's enthusiasm everything's the same and one might as well perish by\r\n",
      "the sword as by famine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hoped she'd fascinate you on the spot,\" Gaston rather ruefully\r\n",
      "remarked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Fascinate'--the language you fellows use! How many times in one's life\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll never know at least that she doesn't: I'll engage for that,\"\r\n",
      "said Mr. Probert handsomely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah be sincere with her, father--she's worth it!\" his son broke out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the elder man took that tone, the tone of vast experience and a\r\n",
      "fastidiousness justified by ineffable recollections, our friend was more\r\n",
      "provoked than he could say, though he was also considerably amused, for\r\n",
      "he had a good while since, made up his mind about the element of rather\r\n",
      "stupid convention in it. It was fatuous to miss so little the fine\r\n",
      "perceptions one didn't have: so far from its showing experience it\r\n",
      "showed a sad simplicity not to FEEL Francie Dosson. He thanked God she\r\n",
      "was just the sort of imponderable infinite quantity, such as there were\r\n",
      "no stupid terms for, that he did feel. He didn't know what old frumps\r\n",
      "his father might have frequented--the style of 1830, with long curls in\r\n",
      "front, a vapid simper, a Scotch plaid dress and a corsage, in a point\r\n",
      "suggestive of twenty whalebones, coming down to the knees--but he could\r\n",
      "remember Mme. de Marignac's Tuesdays and Thursdays and Fridays, with\r\n",
      "Sundays and other days thrown in, and the taste that prevailed in that\r\n",
      "milieu: the books they admired, the verses they read and recited, the\r\n",
      "pictures, great heaven! they thought good, and the three busts of the\r\n",
      "lady of the house in different corners (as a Diana, a Druidess and a\r\n",
      "Croyante: her shoulders were supposed to make up for her head), effigies\r\n",
      "the public ridicule attaching to which to-day would--even the least bad,\r\n",
      "Canova's--make their authors burrow in holes for shame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what else is she worth?\" Mr. Probert asked after a momentary\r\n",
      "hesitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How do you mean, what else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her immense prospects, that's what Susan has been putting forward.\r\n",
      "Susan's insistence on them was mainly what brought over Jane. Do you\r\n",
      "mind my speaking of them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaston was obliged to recognise privately the importance of Jane's\r\n",
      "having been brought over, but he hated to hear it spoken of as if he\r\n",
      "were under an obligation to it. \"To whom, sir?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh only to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You can't do less than Mr. Dosson. As I told you, he waived the\r\n",
      "question of money and he was splendid. We can't be more mercenary than\r\n",
      "he.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He waived the question of his own, you mean?\" said Mr. Probert.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and of yours. But it will be all right.\" The young man flattered\r\n",
      "himself that this was as near as he was willing to go to any view of\r\n",
      "pecuniary convenience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it's your affair--or your sisters',\" his father returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's their idea that we see where we are and that we make the best of\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's very good of them to make the best of it and I should think they'd\r\n",
      "be tired of their own chatter,\" Gaston impatiently sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Probert looked at him a moment in vague surprise, but only said: \"I\r\n",
      "think they are. However, the period of discussion's closed. We've taken\r\n",
      "the jump.\" He then added as to put the matter a little less dryly:\r\n",
      "\"Alphonse and Maxime are quite of your opinion.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of my opinion?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That she's charming.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Confound them then, I'm not of theirs!\" The form of this rejoinder\r\n",
      "was childishly perverse, and it made Mr. Probert stare again; but it\r\n",
      "belonged to one of the reasons for which his children regarded him as\r\n",
      "an old darling that Gaston could suppose him after an instant to embrace\r\n",
      "it. The old man said nothing, but took up his book, and his son, who had\r\n",
      "been standing before the fire, went out of the room. His abstention from\r\n",
      "protest at Gaston's petulance was the more generous as he was capable,\r\n",
      "for his part, of feeling it to make for a greater amenity in the whole\r\n",
      "connexion that ces messieurs should like the little girl at the hotel.\r\n",
      "Gaston didn't care a straw what it made for, and would have seen himself\r\n",
      "in bondage indeed had he given a second thought to the question. This\r\n",
      "was especially the case as his father's mention of the approval of two\r\n",
      "of his brothers-in-law appeared to point to a possible disapproval\r\n",
      "on the part of the third. Francie's lover cared as little whether she\r\n",
      "displeased M. de Brecourt as he cared whether she pleased Maxime and\r\n",
      "Raoul. Mr. Probert continued to read, and in a few moments Gaston was\r\n",
      "with him again. He had expressed surprise, just before, at the wealth of\r\n",
      "discussion his sisters had been ready to expend in his interest, but\r\n",
      "he managed to convey now that there was still a point of a certain\r\n",
      "importance to be made. \"It seems rather odd to me that you should all\r\n",
      "appear to accept the step I'M about to take as a necessity disagreeable\r\n",
      "at the best, when I myself hold that I've been so exceedingly\r\n",
      "fortunate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Probert lowered his book accommodatingly and rested his eyes on\r\n",
      "the fire. \"You won't be content till we're enthusiastic. She seems an\r\n",
      "amiable girl certainly, and in that you're fortunate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think you can tell me what would be better--what you'd have\r\n",
      "preferred,\" the young man said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What I should have preferred? In the first place you must remember that\r\n",
      "I wasn't madly impatient to see you married.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can imagine that, and yet I can't imagine that as things have turned\r\n",
      "out you shouldn't be struck with my felicity. To get something so\r\n",
      "charming and to get it of our own species!\" Gaston explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of our own species? Tudieu!\" said his father, looking up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Surely it's infinitely fresher and more amusing for me to marry\r\n",
      "an American. There's a sad want of freshness--there's even a\r\n",
      "provinciality--in the way we've Gallicised.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Against Americans I've nothing to say; some of them are the best thing\r\n",
      "the world contains. That's precisely why one can choose. They're far\r\n",
      "from doing all like that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like what, dear father?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Comme ces gens-la. You know that if they were French, being otherwise\r\n",
      "what they are, one wouldn't look at them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed one would; they would be such rare curiosities.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, perhaps they'll do for queer fish,\" said Mr. Probert with a\r\n",
      "little conclusive sigh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, let them pass at that. They'll surprise you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not too much, I hope!\" cried the old man, opening his volume again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The complexity of things among the Proberts, it needn't nevertheless\r\n",
      "startle us to learn, was such as to make it impossible for Gaston\r\n",
      "to proceed to the celebration of his nuptial, with all the needful\r\n",
      "circumstances of material preparation and social support, before some\r\n",
      "three months should have expired. He chafed however but moderately under\r\n",
      "this condition, for he remembered it would give Francie time to endear\r\n",
      "herself to his whole circle. It would also have advantages for the\r\n",
      "Dossons; it would enable them to establish by simple but effective arts\r\n",
      "some modus vivendi with that rigid body. It would in short help every\r\n",
      "one to get used to everything. Mr. Dosson's designs and Delia's took\r\n",
      "no articulate form; what was mainly clear to Gaston was that his future\r\n",
      "wife's relatives had as yet no sense of disconnexion. He knew that\r\n",
      "Mr. Dosson would do whatever Delia liked and that Delia would like to\r\n",
      "\"start\" her sister--this whether or no she expected to be present at the\r\n",
      "rest of the race. Mr. Probert notified Mr. Dosson of what he proposed\r\n",
      "to \"do\" for his son, and Mr. Dosson appeared more quietly amused than\r\n",
      "anything else at the news. He announced in return no intentions in\r\n",
      "regard to Francie, and his strange silence was the cause of another\r\n",
      "convocation of the house of Probert. Here Mme. de Brecourt's bold front\r\n",
      "won another victory; she maintained, as she let her brother know, that\r\n",
      "it was too late for any policy but a policy of confidence. \"Lord help\r\n",
      "us, is that what they call confidence?\" the young man gasped, guessing\r\n",
      "the way they all had looked at each other; and he wondered how they\r\n",
      "would look next at poor Mr. Dosson himself. Fortunately he could always\r\n",
      "fall back, for reassurance, on the perfection of their \"forms\"; though\r\n",
      "indeed he thoroughly knew that these forms would never appear so\r\n",
      "striking as on the day--should such a day fatally come--of their\r\n",
      "meddling too much.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Probert's property was altogether in the United States: he resembled\r\n",
      "other discriminating persons for whom the only good taste in America was\r\n",
      "the taste of invested and paying capital. The provisions he was engaging\r\n",
      "to make for his son's marriage rendered advisable some attention, on the\r\n",
      "spot, to interests with the management of which he was acquainted only\r\n",
      "by report. It had long been his conviction that his affairs beyond the\r\n",
      "sea needed looking into; they had gone on and on for years too far from\r\n",
      "the master's eye. He had thought of making the journey in the cause of\r\n",
      "that vigilance, but now he was too old and too tired and the effort had\r\n",
      "become impossible. There was nothing therefore but for Gaston to go, and\r\n",
      "go quickly, though the time so little fostered his absence from Paris.\r\n",
      "The duty was none the less laid upon him and the question practically\r\n",
      "faced; then everything yielded to the consideration that he had\r\n",
      "best wait till after his marriage, when he might be so auspiciously\r\n",
      "accompanied by his wife. Francie would be in many ways so propitious an\r\n",
      "introducer. This abatement would have taken effect had not a call for an\r\n",
      "equal energy on Mr. Dosson's part suddenly appeared to reach and to\r\n",
      "move that gentleman. He had business on the other side, he announced,\r\n",
      "to attend to, though his starting for New York presented difficulties,\r\n",
      "since he couldn't in such a situation leave his daughters alone. Not\r\n",
      "only would such a proceeding have given scandal to the Proberts, but\r\n",
      "Gaston learned, with much surprise and not a little amusement, that\r\n",
      "Delia, in consequence of changes now finely wrought in her personal\r\n",
      "philosophy, wouldn't have felt his doing so square with propriety. The\r\n",
      "young man was able to put it to her that nothing would be simpler than,\r\n",
      "in the interval, for Francie to go and stay with Susan or Margaret; she\r\n",
      "herself in that case would be free to accompany her father. But Delia\r\n",
      "declared at this that nothing would induce her to budge from Paris till\r\n",
      "she had seen her sister through, and Gaston shrank from proposing that\r\n",
      "she too should spend five weeks in the Place Beauvau or the Rue de\r\n",
      "Lille. There was moreover a slight element of the mystifying for him\r\n",
      "in the perverse unsociable way in which Francie took up a position of\r\n",

      "would last six or seven weeks, rather than accept the hospitality of\r\n",
      "any member of his family. Mr. Dosson, on his side, was grateful for the\r\n",

      "explained after the visitor had withdrawn, and even then the remedy for\r\n",
      "the neglect, administered two or three days later, had not borne any\r\n",
      "copious fruit. Mr. Dosson called alone, instructed by his daughter, in\r\n",
      "the Cours la Reine, but Mr. Probert was not at home. He only left a card\r\n",

      "simply through the medium of the visits paid by his daughters to their\r\n",
      "wives, on Messieurs de Brecourt and de Cliche? Once when this subject\r\n",

      "\"Why, yes, if he should say fine things.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They do like fine things,\" Delia had conceded. \"They get off so many\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, people like to be praised in any style.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's so,\" Delia had continued to brood.\r\n",

      "of independence: intending to write to Gaston, and having accidentally\r\n",
      "missed a post, she had determined her letter should be of double its\r\n",
      "usual length. Her companions had respected her claim for solitude, Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson taking himself off to his daily session in the reading-room of\r\n",
      "the American bank and Delia--the girls had now at their command a\r\n",
      "landau as massive as the coach of an ambassador--driving away to the\r\n",
      "dressmaker's, a frequent errand, to superintend and urge forward the\r\n",
      "progress of her sister's wedding-clothes. Francie was not skilled in\r\n",
      "composition; she wrote slowly and had in thus addressing her lover much\r\n",
      "the same sense of sore tension she supposed she should have in standing\r\n",
      "at the altar with him. Her father and Delia had a theory that when she\r\n",
      "shut herself up that way she poured forth pages that would testify to\r\n",
      "her costly culture. When George Flack was ushered in at all events she\r\n",
      "was still bent over her blotting-book at one of the gilded tables, and\r\n",
      "there was an inkstain on her pointed forefinger. It was no disloyalty\r\n",
      "to Gaston, but only at the most an echo as of the sweetness of \"recess\r\n",
      "time\" in old school mornings that made her glad to see her visitor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She hadn't quite known how to finish her letter, in the infinite of the\r\n",
      "bright propriety of her having written it, but Mr. Flack seemed to set a\r\n",
      "practical human limit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wouldn't have ventured,\" he observed on entering, \"to propose this,\r\n",
      "but I guess I can do with it now it's come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What can you do with?\" she asked, wiping her pen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well this happy chance. Just you and me together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know what it's a chance for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, for me to be a little less miserable for a quarter of an hour. It\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It makes you miserable?\"--Francie took it gaily but guardedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You ought to understand--when I say something so noble.\" And settling\r\n",
      "himself on the sofa Mr. Flack continued: \"Well, how do you get on\r\n",
      "without Mr. Probert?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well indeed, thank you.\" The tone in which the girl spoke was\r\n",
      "not an encouragement to free pleasantry, so that if he continued his\r\n",
      "enquiries it was with as much circumspection as he had perhaps ever in\r\n",
      "his life recognised himself as having to apply to a given occasion. He\r\n",
      "was eminently capable of the sense that it wasn't in his interest to\r\n",
      "strike her as indiscreet and profane; he only wanted still to appear\r\n",
      "a real reliable \"gentleman friend.\" At the same time he was not\r\n",
      "indifferent to the profit for him of her noticing in him a sense as of\r\n",
      "a good fellow once badly \"sold,\" which would always give him a certain\r\n",
      "pull on what he called to himself her lovely character. \"Well, you're in\r\n",
      "the real 'grand' old monde now, I suppose,\" he resumed at last, not\r\n",
      "with an air of undue derision--rather with a kind of contemporary but\r\n",
      "detached wistfulness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'm not in anything; I'm just where I've always been.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sorry; I hoped you'd tell me a good lot about it,\" said Mr. Flack,\r\n",
      "not with levity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You think too much of that. What do you want to know so much about it\r\n",
      "for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, he took some trouble for his reason. \"Dear Miss Francie, a poor\r\n",
      "devil of a journalist who has to get his living by studying-up things\r\n",
      "has to think TOO much, sometimes, in order to think, or at any rate to\r\n",
      "do, enough. We find out what we can--AS we can, you see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She did seem to catch in it the note of pathos. \"What do you want to\r\n",
      "study-up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everything! I take in everything. It all depends on my opportunity. I\r\n",
      "try and learn--I try and improve. Every one has something to tell--or to\r\n",
      "sell; and I listen and watch--well, for what I can drink in or can\r\n",
      "buy. I hoped YOU'D have something to tell--for I'm not talking now of\r\n",
      "anything but THAT. I don't believe but what you've seen a good deal of\r\n",
      "new life. You won't pretend they ain't working you right in, charming as\r\n",
      "you are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean if they've been kind and sweet to me? They've been very\r\n",
      "kind and sweet,\" Francie mid. \"They want to do even more than I'll let\r\n",
      "them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah why won't you let them?\" George Flack asked almost coaxingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I do, when it comes to anything,\" the girl went on. \"You can't\r\n",
      "resist them really; they've got such lovely ways.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should like to hear you talk right out about their ways,\" her\r\n",
      "companion observed after a silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I could talk out right enough if once I were to begin. But I don't\r\n",
      "see why it should interest you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't I care immensely for everything that concerns you? Didn't I tell\r\n",
      "you that once?\"--he put it very straight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you were foolish ever, and you'd be foolish to say it again,\"\r\n",
      "Francie replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't want to say anything, I've had my lesson. But I could\r\n",
      "listen to you all day.\" Francie gave an exclamation of impatience and\r\n",
      "incredulity, and Mr. Flack pursued: \"Don't you remember what you told me\r\n",
      "that time we had that talk at Saint-Germain, on the terrace? You said I\r\n",
      "might remain your friend.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that's all right,\" said the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then ain't we interested in the development of our friends--in their\r\n",
      "impressions, their situations and adventures? Especially a person like\r\n",
      "me, who has got to know life whether he wants to or no--who has got to\r\n",
      "know the world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean to say I could teach you about life?\" Francie beautifully\r\n",
      "gaped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About some kinds certainly. You know a lot of people it's difficult to\r\n",
      "get at unless one takes some extraordinary measures, as you've done.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean? What measures have I done?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, THEY have--to get right hold of you--and its the same thing.\r\n",
      "Pouncing on you, to secure you first--I call that energetic, and don't\r\n",
      "you think I ought to know?\" smiled Mr. Flack with much meaning. \"I\r\n",
      "thought _I_ was energetic, but they got in ahead of me. They're a\r\n",
      "society apart, and they must be very curious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, they're very curious,\" Francie admitted with a resigned sigh. Then\r\n",
      "she said: \"Do you want to put them in the paper?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "George Flack cast about--the air of the question was so candid,\r\n",
      "suggested so complete an exemption From prejudice. \"Oh I'm very careful\r\n",
      "about what I put in the paper. I want everything, as I told you; Don't\r\n",
      "you remember the sketch I gave you of my ideals? But I want it in the\r\n",
      "right way and of the right brand. If I can't get it in the shape I like\r\n",
      "it I don't want it at all; first-rate first-hand information, straight\r\n",
      "from the tap, is what I'm after. I don't want to hear what some one\r\n",
      "or other thinks that some one or other was told that some one or other\r\n",
      "believed or said; and above all I don't want to print it. There's plenty\r\n",
      "of that flowing in, and the best part of the job's to keep it out.\r\n",
      "People just yearn to come in; they make love to me for it all over the\r\n",
      "place; there's the biggest crowd at the door. But I say to them: 'You've\r\n",
      "got to do something first, then I'll see; or at any rate you've got to\r\n",
      "BE something!'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We sometimes see the Reverberator. You've some fine pieces,\" Francie\r\n",
      "humanely replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sometimes only? Don't they send it to the old gentleman--the weekly\r\n",
      "edition? I thought I had fixed that,\" said George Flack.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know; it's usually lying round. But Delia reads it more than I;\r\n",
      "she reads pieces aloud. I like to read books; I read as many as I can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it's all literature,\" said Mr. Flack; \"it's all the press, the\r\n",
      "great institution of our time. Some of the finest books have come out\r\n",
      "first in the papers. It's the history of the age.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see you've got the same aspirations,\" Francie remarked kindly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The same aspirations?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Those you told me about that day at Saint-Germain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I keep forgetting that I ever broke out to you that way.\r\n",
      "Everything's so changed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you the proprietor of the paper now?\" the girl went on, determined\r\n",
      "not to catch this sentimental echo.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you care? It wouldn't even be delicate in me to tell you; for\r\n",
      "I DO remember the way you said you'd try and get your father to help me.\r\n",
      "Don't say you've forgotten it, because you almost made me cry. Anyway,\r\n",
      "that isn't the sort of help I want now and it wasn't the sort of help I\r\n",
      "meant to ask you for then. I want sympathy and interest; I want some one\r\n",
      "to say to me once in a while 'Keep up your old heart, Mr. Flack; you'll\r\n",
      "come out all right.' You see I'm a working-man and I don't pretend to\r\n",
      "be anything else,\" Francie's companion went on. \"I don't live on the\r\n",
      "accumulations of my ancestors. What I have I earn--what I am I've fought\r\n",
      "for: I'm a real old travailleur, as they say here. I rejoice in it, but\r\n",
      "there's one dark spot in it all the same.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what's that?\" Francie decided not quite at once to ask.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That it makes you ashamed of me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh how can you say?\" And she got up as if a sense of oppression, of\r\n",
      "vague discomfort, had come over her. Her visitor troubled such peace as\r\n",
      "she had lately arrived at.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You wouldn't be ashamed to go round with me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Round where?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, anywhere: just to have one more walk. The very last.\" George\r\n",
      "Flack had got up too and stood there looking at her with his bright\r\n",
      "eyes, his hands in the pockets of his overcoat. As she hesitated he\r\n",
      "continued: \"Then I'm not such a friend after all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She rested her eyes a moment on the carpet; then raising them: \"Where\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You could render me a service--a real service--without any\r\n",
      "inconvenience probably to yourself. Isn't your portrait finished?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but he won't give it up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who won't give it up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why Mr. Waterlow. He wants to keep it near him to look at it in case he\r\n",
      "should take a fancy to change it. But I hope he won't change it--it's so\r\n",
      "lovely as it is!\" Francie made a mild joke of saying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hear it's magnificent and I want to see it,\" said George Flack.\r\n",

      "\"I'll go if you'll take me; that's the service you can render me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why I thought you went everywhere--into the palaces of kings!\" Francie\r\n",
      "cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I go where I'm welcome, not where I ain't. I don't want to push into\r\n",
      "that studio alone; he doesn't want me round. Oh you needn't protest,\"\r\n",
      "the young man went on; \"if a fellow's made sensitive he has got to stay\r\n",
      "so. I feel those things in the shade of a tone of voice. He doesn't like\r\n",
      "newspaper-men. Some people don't, you know. I ought to tell you that\r\n",
      "frankly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie considered again, but looking this time at her visitor. \"Why if\r\n",
      "it hadn't been for you \"--I'm afraid she said \"hadn't have been\"--\"I'd\r\n",
      "never have sat to him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack smiled at her in silence for a little. \"If it hadn't been for\r\n",
      "me I think you'd never have met your future husband.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps not,\" said Francie; and suddenly she blushed red, rather to her\r\n",
      "companion's surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I only say that to remind you that after all I've a right to ask you to\r\n",
      "show me this one little favour. Let me drive with you to-morrow, or next\r\n",
      "day or any day, to the Avenue de Villiers, and I shall regard myself as\r\n",
      "amply repaid. With you I shan't be afraid to go in, for you've a right\r\n",
      "to take any one you like to see your picture. That's the rule here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh the day you're afraid, Mr. Flack--!\" Francie laughed without fear.\r\n",
      "She had been much struck by his reminder of what they all owed him; for\r\n",
      "he truly had been their initiator, the instrument, under providence,\r\n",
      "that had opened a great new interest to them, and as she was more\r\n",
      "listless about almost anything than at the sight of a person wronged she\r\n",
      "winced at his describing himself as disavowed or made light of after the\r\n",
      "prize was gained. Her mind had not lingered on her personal indebtedness\r\n",
      "to him, for it was not in the nature of her mind to linger; but at\r\n",
      "present she was glad to spring quickly, at the first word, into the\r\n",
      "attitude of acknowledgement. It had the effect of simplification after\r\n",
      "too multiplied an appeal--it brought up her spirits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I must be quite square with you,\" the young man said in a\r\n",
      "tone that struck her as \"higher,\" somehow, than any she had ever heard\r\n",
      "him use. \"If I want to see the picture it's because I want to write\r\n",
      "about it. The whole thing will go bang into the Reverberator. You must\r\n",
      "understand that in advance. I wouldn't write about it without seeing it.\r\n",
      "We don't DO that\"--and Mr. Flack appeared to speak proudly again for his\r\n",
      "organ.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"J'espere bien!\" said Francie, who was getting on famously with her\r\n",
      "French. \"Of course if you praise him Mr. Waterlow will like it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know that he cares for my praise and I don't care much whether\r\n",
      "HE likes it or not. For you to like it's the principal thing--we must do\r\n",
      "with that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I shall be awfully proud.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall speak of you personally--I shall say you're the prettiest girl\r\n",
      "that has ever come over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You may say what you like,\" Francie returned. \"It will be immense fun\r\n",
      "to be in the newspapers. Come for me at this hour day after to-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're too kind,\" said George Flack, taking up his hat. He smoothed it\r\n",
      "down a moment with his glove; then he said: \"I wonder if you'll mind our\r\n",
      "going alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean just you and me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh don't you be afraid! Father and Delia have seen it about thirty\r\n",
      "times.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That'll be first-rate. And it will help me to feel, more than anything\r\n",
      "else could make me do, that we're still old friends. I couldn't bear the\r\n",
      "end of THAT. I'll come at 3.15,\" Mr. Flack went on, but without even yet\r\n",
      "taking his departure. He asked two or three questions about the hotel,\r\n",
      "whether it were as good as last year and there were many people in\r\n",
      "it and they could keep their rooms warm; then pursued suddenly, on a\r\n",
      "different plane and scarcely waiting for the girl's answer: \"And now for\r\n",
      "instance are they very bigoted? That's one of the things I should like\r\n",
      "to know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very bigoted?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ain't they tremendous Catholics--always talking about the Holy Father;\r\n",
      "what they call here the throne and the altar? And don't they want the\r\n",
      "throne too? I mean Mr. Probert, the old gentleman,\" Mr. Flack added.\r\n",
      "\"And those grand ladies and all the rest of them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're very religious,\" said Francie. \"They're the most religious\r\n",
      "people I ever saw. They just adore the Holy Father. They know him\r\n",
      "personally quite well. They're always going down to Rome.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And do they mean to introduce you to him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How do you mean, to introduce me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why to make you a Catholic, to take you also down to Rome.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh we're going to Rome for our voyage de noces!\" said Francie gaily.\r\n",
      "\"Just for a peep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And won't you have to have a Catholic marriage if They won't consent to\r\n",
      "a Protestant one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We're going to have a lovely one, just like one that Mme. de Brecourt\r\n",
      "took me to see at the Madeleine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And will it be at the Madeleine, too?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, unless we have it at Notre Dame.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And how will your father and sister like that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Our having it at Notre Dame?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, or at the Madeleine. Your not having it at the American church.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Delia wants it at the best place,\" said Francie simply. Then she\r\n",
      "added: \"And you know poppa ain't much on religion.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well now that's what I call a genuine fact, the sort I was talking\r\n",
      "about,\" Mr. Flack replied. Whereupon he at last took himself off,\r\n",
      "repeating that he would come in two days later, at 3.15 sharp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie gave an account of his visit to her sister, on the return of\r\n",
      "the latter young lady, and mentioned the agreement they had come to in\r\n",
      "relation to the drive. Delia brooded on it a while like a sitting\r\n",
      "hen, so little did she know that it was right (\"as\" it was right Delia\r\n",
      "usually said) that Francie should be so intimate with other gentlemen\r\n",
      "after she was engaged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Intimate? You wouldn't think it's very intimate if you were to see me!\"\r\n",
      "Francie cried with amusement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I don't want to see you,\" Delia declared--the sharpness of\r\n",
      "which made her sister suddenly strenuous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Delia Dosson, do you realise that if it hadn't been for Mr. Flack we\r\n",
      "would never have had that picture, and that if it hadn't been for that\r\n",
      "picture I should never have got engaged?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It would have been better if you hadn't, if that's the way you're going\r\n",
      "to behave. Nothing would induce me to go with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was what suited Francie, but she was nevertheless struck by Delia's\r\n",
      "rigour. \"I'm only going to take him to see Mr. Waterlow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has he become all of a sudden too shy to go alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you know Mr. Waterlow has a prejudice against him and has made\r\n",
      "him feel it. You know Gaston told us so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He told us HE couldn't bear him; that's what he told us,\" said Delia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All the more reason I should be kind to him. Why Delia, do realise,\"\r\n",
      "Francie went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just what I do,\" returned the elder girl; \"but things that are\r\n",
      "very different from those you want me to. You have queer reasons.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've others too that you may like better. He wants to put a piece in\r\n",
      "the paper about it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About your picture?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and about me. All about the whole thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia stared a moment. \"Well, I hope it will be a good one!\" she said\r\n",
      "with a groan of oppression as from the crushing majesty of their fate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "X\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Francie, two days later, passed with Mr. Flack into Charles\r\n",
      "Waterlow's studio she found Mme. de Cliche before the great canvas. She\r\n",
      "enjoyed every positive sign that the Proberts took an interest in her,\r\n",
      "and this was a considerable symptom, Gaston's second sister's coming all\r\n",
      "that way--she lived over by the Invalides--to look at the portrait once\r\n",
      "more. Francie knew she had seen it at an earlier stage; the work had\r\n",
      "excited curiosity and discussion among the Proberts from the first of\r\n",
      "their making her acquaintance, when they went into considerations about\r\n",
      "it which had not occurred to the original and her companions--frequently\r\n",
      "as, to our knowledge, these good people had conversed on the subject.\r\n",
      "Gaston had told her that opinions differed much in the family as to the\r\n",
      "merit of the work, and that Margaret, precisely, had gone so far as to\r\n",
      "say that it might be a masterpiece of tone but didn't make her look like\r\n",
      "a lady. His father on the other hand had no objection to offer to the\r\n",
      "character in which it represented her, but he didn't think it well\r\n",
      "painted. \"Regardez-moi ca, et ca, et ca, je vous demande!\" he had\r\n",
      "exclaimed, making little dashes at the canvas with his glove, toward\r\n",
      "mystifying spots, on occasions when the artist was not at hand. The\r\n",
      "Proberts always fell into French when they spoke on a question of\r\n",
      "art. \"Poor dear papa, he only understands le vieux jeu!\" Gaston had\r\n",
      "explained, and he had still further to expound what he meant by the old\r\n",
      "game. The brand-newness of Charles Waterlow's game had already been a\r\n",
      "bewilderment to Mr. Probert.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie remembered now--she had forgotten it--Margaret de Cliche's\r\n",
      "having told her she meant to come again. She hoped the marquise thought\r\n",
      "by this time that, on canvas at least, she looked a little more like a\r\n",
      "lady. Mme. de Cliche smiled at her at any rate and kissed her, as if\r\n",
      "in fact there could be no mistake. She smiled also at Mr. Flack, on\r\n",
      "Francie's introducing him, and only looked grave when, after she had\r\n",
      "asked where the others were--the papa and the grande soeur--the girl\r\n",
      "replied that she hadn't the least idea: her party consisted only of\r\n",
      "herself and Mr. Flack. Then Mme. de Cliche's grace stiffened, taking on\r\n",
      "a shade that brought back Francie's sense that she was the individual,\r\n",
      "among all Gaston's belongings, who had pleased her least from the first.\r\n",
      "Mme. de Douves was superficially more formidable, but with her the\r\n",
      "second impression was comparatively comforting. It was just this second\r\n",
      "impression of the marquise that was not. There were perhaps others\r\n",
      "behind it, but the girl hadn't yet arrived at them. Mr. Waterlow\r\n",
      "mightn't have been very much prepossessed with Mr. Flack, but he was\r\n",
      "none the less perfectly civil to him and took much trouble to show him\r\n",
      "the work he had in hand, dragging out canvases, changing lights, moving\r\n",
      "him off to see things at the other end of the great room. While the two\r\n",
      "gentlemen were at a distance Mme. de Cliche expressed to Francie the\r\n",
      "conviction that she would allow her to see her home: on which Francie\r\n",
      "replied that she was not going home, but was going somewhere else with\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack. And she explained, as if it simplified the matter, that this\r\n",
      "gentleman was a big editor. Her sister-in-law that was to be echoed\r\n",
      "the term and Francie developed her explanation. He was not the only big\r\n",
      "editor, but one of the many big editors, of an enormous American paper.\r\n",
      "He was going to publish an article--as big, as enormous, as all the rest\r\n",
      "of the business--about her portrait. Gaston knew him perfectly: it was\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack who had been the cause of Gaston's being presented to her.\r\n",
      "Mme. de Cliche looked across at him as if the inadequacy of the cause\r\n",
      "projected an unfavourable light upon an effect hitherto perhaps not\r\n",
      "exactly measured; she appealed as to whether Francie thought Gaston\r\n",
      "would like her to drive about Paris alone with one of ces messieurs.\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I don't know. I never asked him!\" said Francie. \"He ought to\r\n",
      "want me to be polite to a person who did so much for us.\" Soon after\r\n",
      "this Mme. de Cliche retired with no fresh sign of any sense of the\r\n",
      "existence of Mr. Flack, though he stood in her path as she approached\r\n",
      "the door. She didn't kiss our young lady again, and the girl\r\n",
      "observed that her leave-taking consisted of the simple words \"Adieu\r\n",
      "mademoiselle.\" She had already noted that in proportion as the Proberts\r\n",
      "became majestic they became articulately French. She and Mr. Flack\r\n",
      "remained in the studio but a short time longer, and when they were\r\n",
      "seated in the carriage again, at the door--they had come in Mr. Dosson's\r\n",
      "open landau--her companion said \"And now where shall we go?\" He spoke\r\n",
      "as if on their way from the hotel he hadn't touched upon the pleasant\r\n",
      "vision of a little turn in the Bois. He had insisted then that the day\r\n",
      "was made on purpose, the air full of spring. At present he seemed to\r\n",
      "wish to give himself the pleasure of making his companion choose that\r\n",
      "particular alternative. But she only answered rather impatiently:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wherever you like, wherever you like!\" And she sat there swaying her\r\n",
      "parasol, looking about her, giving no order.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Au Bois,\" said George Flack to the coachman, leaning back on the\r\n",
      "soft cushions. For a few moments after the carriage had taken its easy\r\n",
      "elastic start they were silent; but he soon began again. \"Was that lady\r\n",
      "one of your new relatives?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean one of Mr. Probert's old ones? She's his sister.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is there any particular reason in that why she shouldn't say\r\n",
      "good-morning to me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She didn't want you to remain with me. She doesn't like you to go round\r\n",
      "with me. She wanted to carry me off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What has she got against me?\" Mr. Flack asked with a kind of portentous\r\n",
      "calm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie seemed to consider a little. \"Oh it's these funny French ideas.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Funny? Some of them are very base,\" said George Flack.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion made no answer; she only turned her eyes to right\r\n",
      "and left, admiring the splendid day and shining city. The great\r\n",
      "architectural vista was fair: the tall houses, with their polished\r\n",
      "shop-fronts, their balconies, their signs with accented letters, seemed\r\n",
      "to make a glitter of gilt and crystal as they rose in the sunny air.\r\n",
      "The colour of everything was cool and pretty and the sound of everything\r\n",
      "gay; the sense of a costly spectacle was everywhere. \"Well, I like Paris\r\n",
      "anyway!\" Francie exhaled at last with her little harmonising flatness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's lucky for you, since you've got to live here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I haven't got to; there's no obligation. We haven't settled anything\r\n",
      "about that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hasn't that lady settled it for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, very likely she has,\" said Francie placidly enough. \"I don't like\r\n",
      "her so well as the others.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You like the others very much?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I do. So would you if they had made so much of you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That one at the studio didn't make much of me, certainly,\" Mr. Flack\r\n",
      "declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, she's the most haughty,\" Francie allowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what is it all about?\" her friend demanded. \"Who are they\r\n",
      "anyway?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it would take me three hours to tell you,\" the girl cheerfully\r\n",
      "sighed. \"They go back a thousand years.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, we've GOT a thousand years--I mean three hours.\" And George Flack\r\n",
      "settled himself more on his cushions and inhaled the pleasant air. \"I\r\n",
      "AM getting something out of this drive, Miss Francie,\" he went on. \"It's\r\n",
      "many a day since I've been to the old Bois. I don't fool round much in\r\n",
      "woods.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie replied candidly that for her too the occasion was most\r\n",
      "agreeable, and Mr. Flack pursued, looking round him with his hard smile,\r\n",
      "irrelevantly but sociably: \"Yes, these French ideas! I don't see how you\r\n",
      "can stand them. Those they have about young ladies are horrid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, they tell me you like them better after you're married.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why after they're married they're worse--I mean the ideas. Every one\r\n",
      "knows that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, they can make you like anything, the way they talk,\" Francie\r\n",
      "said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And do they talk a great deal?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I should think so. They don't do much else, and all about the\r\n",
      "queerest things--things I never heard of.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah THAT I'll bet my life on!\" Mr. Flack returned with understanding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course,\" his companion obligingly proceeded, \"'ve had most\r\n",
      "conversation with Mr. Probert.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The old gentleman?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, very little with him. I mean with Gaston. But it's not he that\r\n",
      "has told me most--it's Mme. de Brecourt. She's great on life, on THEIR\r\n",
      "life--it's very interesting. She has told me all their histories, all\r\n",
      "their troubles and complications.\"\r\n",

      "\"Complications?\" Mr. Flack threw off. \"That's what she calls them.\r\n",
      "It seems very different from America. It's just like a beautiful\r\n",

      "see--without being told.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What sort of things?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, like Mme. de Cliche's--\" But Francie paused as if for a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her friend was prompt with assistance. \"Do you mean her complications?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and her husband's. She has terrible ones. That's why one must\r\n",
      "forgive her if she's rather peculiar. She's very unhappy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean through her husband?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, he likes other ladies better. He flirts with Mme. de Brives.\"\r\n",

      "Mr. Flack's hand closed over it. \"Mme. de Brives?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, she's lovely,\" said Francie. \"She ain't very young, but she's\r\n",
      "fearfully attractive. And he used to go every day to have tea with Mme.\r\n",
      "de Villepreux. Mme. de Cliche can't bear Mme. de Villepreux.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, he seems a kind of MEAN man,\" George Flack moralised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh his mother was very bad. That was one thing they had against the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Her brother does; but every one else calls her Margot. Old Mme. de\r\n",
      "Cliche had a horrid reputation. Every one hated her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Except those, I suppose, who liked her too much!\" Mr. Flack permitted\r\n",
      "himself to guess. \"And who's Mme. de Villepreux?\" he proceeded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's the daughter of Mme. de Marignac.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And who's THAT old sinner?\" the young man asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I guess she's dead,\" said Francie. \"She used to be a great friend of\r\n",

      "mischief's Susan?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why Mme. de Brecourt. Mr. Probert just loved Mme. de Marignac. Mme.\r\n",
      "de Villepreux isn't so nice as her mother. She was brought up with the\r\n",

      "\"With Maxime?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's M. de Cliche.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I see--I see!\" and George Flack engulfed it. They had reached the\r\n",
      "top of the Champs Elysees and were passing below the wondrous arch to\r\n",
      "which that gentle eminence forms a pedestal and which looks down even\r\n",
      "on splendid Paris from its immensity and across at the vain mask of the\r\n",
      "Tuileries and the river-moated Louvre and the twin towers of Notre Dame\r\n",
      "painted blue by the distance. The confluence of carriages--a sounding\r\n",
      "stream in which our friends became engaged--rolled into the large avenue\r\n",
      "leading to the Bois de Boulogne. Mr. Flack evidently enjoyed the scene;\r\n",
      "he gazed about him at their neighbours, at the villas and gardens\r\n",
      "on either hand; he took in the prospect of the far-stretching brown\r\n",
      "boskages and smooth alleys of the wood, of the hour they had yet to\r\n",
      "spend there, of the rest of Francie's pleasant prattle, of the place\r\n",
      "near the lake where they could alight and walk a little; even of the\r\n",
      "bench where they might sit down. \"I see, I see,\" he repeated with\r\n",
      "appreciation. \"You make me feel quite as if I were in the grand old\r\n",

      "XI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day at noon, shortly before the time for which Gaston had announced\r\n",
      "his return, a note was brought Francie from Mme. de Brecourt. It caused\r\n",
      "her some agitation, though it contained a clause intended to guard\r\n",
      "her against vain fears. \"Please come to me the moment you've received\r\n",
      "this--I've sent the carriage. I'll explain when you get here what I want\r\n",
      "to see you about. Nothing has happened to Gaston. We are all here.\" The\r\n",
      "coupe from the Place Beauvau was waiting at the door of the hotel, and\r\n",
      "the girl had but a hurried conference with her father and sister--if\r\n",
      "conference it could be called in which vagueness on the one side melted\r\n",
      "into blankness on the other. \"It's for something bad--something bad,\"\r\n",
      "Francie none the less said while she tied her bonnet, though she was\r\n",
      "unable to think what it could be. Delia, who looked a good deal scared,\r\n",
      "offered to accompany her; on which Mr. Dosson made the first remark of\r\n",
      "a practical character in which he had indulged in relation to his\r\n",
      "daughter's alliance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No you won't--no you won't, my dear. They may whistle for Francie, but\r\n",
      "let them see that they can't whistle for all of us.\" It was the first\r\n",
      "sign he had given of being jealous of the dignity of the Dossons. That\r\n",
      "question had never troubled him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know what it is,\" said Delia while she arranged her sister's\r\n",
      "garments. \"They want to talk about religion. They've got the priests;\r\n",
      "there's some bishop or perhaps some cardinal. They want to baptise you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you'd better take a waterproof!\" Francie's father called after her\r\n",
      "as she flitted away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She wondered, rolling toward the Place Beauvau, what they were all there\r\n",
      "for; that announcement balanced against the reassurance conveyed in\r\n",
      "the phrase about Gaston. She liked them individually, but in their\r\n",
      "collective form they made her uneasy. In their family parties there was\r\n",
      "always something of the tribunal. Mme. de Brecourt came out to meet her\r\n",
      "in the vestibule, drawing her quickly into a small room--not the salon;\r\n",
      "Francie knew it as her hostess's \"own room,\" a lovely boudoir--in which,\r\n",
      "considerably to the girl's relief, the rest of the family were not\r\n",
      "assembled. Yet she guessed in a moment that they were near at hand--they\r\n",
      "were waiting. Susan looked flushed and strange; she had a queer smile;\r\n",
      "she kissed her as if she didn't know she was doing it. She laughed\r\n",
      "as she greeted her, but her laugh was extravagant; it was a different\r\n",
      "demonstration every way from any Francie had hitherto had to reckon\r\n",
      "with. By the time our young lady had noted these things she was sitting\r\n",
      "beside her on a sofa and Mme. de Brecourt had her hand, which she held\r\n",
      "so tight that it almost hurt her. Susan's eyes were in their nature\r\n",
      "salient, but on this occasion they seemed to have started out of her\r\n",
      "head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We're upside down--terribly agitated. A thunderbolt has fallen on the\r\n",
      "house.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter--what's the matter?\" Francie asked, pale and with\r\n",
      "parted lips. She had a sudden wild idea that Gaston might have found out\r\n",
      "in America that her father had no money, had lost it all; that it had\r\n",
      "been stolen during their long absence. But would he cast her off for\r\n",
      "that?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must understand the closeness of our union with you from our\r\n",
      "sending for you this way--the first, the only person--in a crisis. Our\r\n",
      "joys are your joys and our indignations are yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What IS the matter, PLEASE?\" the girl repeated. Their \"indignations\"\r\n",
      "opened up a gulf; it flashed upon her, with a shock of mortification\r\n",
      "for the belated idea, that something would have come out: a piece in\r\n",
      "the paper, from Mr. Flack, about her portrait and even a little about\r\n",
      "herself. But that was only more mystifying, for certainly Mr. Flack\r\n",
      "could only have published something pleasant--something to be proud\r\n",
      "of. Had he by some incredible perversity or treachery stated that the\r\n",
      "picture was bad, or even that SHE was? She grew dizzy, remembering\r\n",
      "how she had refused him, and how little he had liked it, that day at\r\n",
      "Saint-Germain. But they had made that up over and over, especially when\r\n",
      "they sat so long on a bench together (the time they drove) in the Bois\r\n",
      "de Boulogne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh the most awful thing; a newspaper sent this morning from America to\r\n",
      "my father--containing two horrible columns of vulgar lies and scandal\r\n",
      "about our family, about all of us, about you, about your picture,\r\n",
      "about poor Marguerite, calling her 'Margot,' about Maxime and Leonie de\r\n",
      "Villepreux, saying he's her lover, about all our affairs, about Gaston,\r\n",
      "about your marriage, about your sister and your dresses and your\r\n",
      "dimples, about our darling father, whose history it professes to relate\r\n",
      "in the most ignoble, the most revolting terms. Papa's in the most awful\r\n",
      "state!\" and Mme. de Brecourt panted to take breath. She had spoken with\r\n",
      "the volubility of horror and passion. \"You're outraged with us and you\r\n",
      "must suffer with us,\" she went on. \"But who has done it? Who has done\r\n",
      "it? Who has done it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why Mr. Flack--Mr. Flack!\" Francie quickly replied. She was appalled,\r\n",
      "overwhelmed; but her foremost feeling was the wish not to appear to\r\n",
      "disavow her knowledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Flack? do you mean that awful person--? He ought to be shot,\r\n",
      "he ought to be burnt alive. Maxime will kill him, Maxime's in an\r\n",
      "unspeakable rage. Everything's at end, we've been served up to\r\n",
      "the rabble, we shall have to leave Paris. How could he know such\r\n",
      "things?--and they all so infamously false!\" The poor woman poured forth\r\n",
      "her woe in questions, contradictions, lamentations; she didn't know\r\n",
      "what to ask first, against what to protest. \"Do you mean that wretch\r\n",
      "Marguerite saw you with at Mr. Waterlow's? Oh Francie, what has\r\n",
      "happened? She had a feeling then, a dreadful foreboding. She saw you\r\n",
      "afterwards--walking with him--in the Bois.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I didn't see her,\" the girl said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You were talking with him--you were too absorbed: that's what Margot\r\n",
      "remembers. Oh Francie, Francie!\" wailed Mme. de Brecourt, whose distress\r\n",
      "was pitiful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She tried to interfere at the studio, but I wouldn't let her. He's\r\n",
      "an old friend--a friend of poppa's--and I like him very much. What my\r\n",
      "father allows, that's not for others to criticise!\" Francie continued.\r\n",
      "She was frightened, extremely frightened, at her companion's air of\r\n",
      "tragedy and at the dreadful consequences she alluded to, consequences of\r\n",
      "an act she herself didn't know, couldn't comprehend nor measure yet.\r\n",
      "But there was an instinct of bravery in her which threw her into blind\r\n",
      "defence, defence even of George Flack, though it was a part of her\r\n",
      "consternation that on her too he should have practised a surprise--it\r\n",
      "would appear to be some self-seeking deception.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh how can you bear with such brutes, how can your father--? What devil\r\n",
      "has he paid to tattle to him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You scare me awfully--you terrify me,\" the girl could but plead.\r\n",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't seen it, I don't\r\n",
      "understand it. Of course I've talked to Mr. Flack.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Francie, don't say it--don't SAY it! Dear child, you haven't talked\r\n",
      "to him in that fashion: vulgar horrors and such a language!\" Mme. de\r\n",
      "Brecourt came nearer, took both her hands now, drew her closer, seemed\r\n",
      "to supplicate her for some disproof, some antidote to the nightmare.\r\n",
      "\"You shall see the paper; they've got it in the other room--the most\r\n",
      "disgusting sheet. Margot's reading it to her husband; he can't read\r\n",
      "English, if you can call it English: such a style of the gutter! Papa\r\n",
      "tried to translate it to Maxime, but he couldn't, he was too sick.\r\n",
      "There's a quantity about Mme. de Marignac--imagine only! And a quantity\r\n",
      "about Jeanne and Raoul and their economies in the country. When they see\r\n",
      "it in Brittany--heaven preserve us!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie had turned very white; she looked for a minute at the carpet.\r\n",
      "\"And what does it say about me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Some trash about your being the great American beauty, with the\r\n",
      "most odious details, and your having made a match among the 'rare old\r\n",
      "exclusives.' And the strangest stuff about your father--his having\r\n",
      "gone into a 'store' at the age of twelve. And something about your poor\r\n",
      "sister--heaven help us! And a sketch of our career in Paris, as\r\n",
      "they call it, and the way we've pushed and got on and our ridiculous\r\n",
      "pretensions. And a passage about Blanche de Douves, Raoul's sister, who\r\n",
      "had that disease--what do they call it?--that she used to steal things\r\n",
      "in shops: do you see them reading THAT? And how did he know such a\r\n",
      "thing? It's ages ago, it's dead and buried!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You told me, you told me yourself,\" said Francie quickly. She turned\r\n",
      "red the instant she had spoken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't say it's YOU--don't, don't, my darling!\" cried Mme. de Brecourt,\r\n",
      "who had stared and glared at her. \"That's what I want, that's what you\r\n",
      "must do, that's what I see you this way for first alone. I've answered\r\n",
      "for you, you know; you must repudiate the remotest connexion; you must\r\n",
      "deny it up to the hilt. Margot suspects you--she has got that idea--she\r\n",
      "has given it to the others. I've told them they ought to be ashamed,\r\n",
      "that it's an outrage to all we know you and love you for. I've done\r\n",
      "everything for the last hour to protect you. I'm your godmother, you\r\n",
      "know, and you mustn't disappoint me. You're incapable, and you must say\r\n",
      "so, face to face, to my father. Think of Gaston, cherie; HE'LL have seen\r\n",
      "it over there, alone, far from us all. Think of HIS horror and of HIS\r\n",
      "anguish and of HIS faith, of what HE would expect of you.\" Mme. de\r\n",
      "Brecourt hurried on, and her companion's bewilderment deepened to see\r\n",
      "how the tears had risen to her eyes and were pouring down her cheeks.\r\n",
      "\"You must say to my father, face to face, that you're incapable--that\r\n",
      "you're stainless.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stainless?\" Francie bleated it like a bewildered interrogative lamb.\r\n",
      "But the sheep-dog had to be faced. \"Of course I knew he wanted to write\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"About your marriage--of course you knew? Then, wretched girl, you're\r\n",
      "at the bottom of ALL!\" cried Mme. de Brecourt, flinging herself away,\r\n",
      "falling back on the sofa, prostrate there and covering her face with her\r\n",
      "hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He told me--he told me when I went with him to the studio!\" Francie\r\n",
      "asseverated loud. \"But he seems to have printed more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"MORE? I should think so!\" And Mme. de Brecourt rebounded, standing\r\n",
      "before her. \"And you LET him--about yourself? You gave him preposterous\r\n",
      "facts?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I told him--I told him--I don't know what. It was for his paper--he\r\n",
      "wants everything. It's a very fine paper,\" said the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A very fine paper?\" Mme. de Brecourt flushed, with parted lips.\r\n",
      "\"Have you SEEN, have you touched the hideous sheet? Ah my brother, my\r\n",
      "brother!\" she quavered again, turning away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If your brother were here you wouldn't talk to me this way--he'd\r\n",
      "protect me, Gaston would!\" cried Francie, on her feet, seizing her\r\n",
      "little muff and moving to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go away, go away or they'll kill you!\" her friend went on excitedly.\r\n",
      "\"After all I've done for you--after the way I've lied for you!\" And she\r\n",
      "sobbed, trying to repress her sobs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie, at this, broke out into a torrent of tears. \"I'll go home.\r\n",
      "Poppa, poppa!\" she almost shrieked, reaching the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh your father--he has been a nice father, bringing you up in such\r\n",
      "ideas!\" These words followed her with infinite scorn, but almost as Mme.\r\n",
      "de Brecourt uttered them, struck by a sound, she sprang after the girl,\r\n",
      "seized her, drew her back and held her a moment listening before\r\n",
      "she could pass out. \"Hush--hush--they're coming in here, they're too\r\n",
      "anxious! Deny--deny it--say you know nothing! Your sister must have said\r\n",
      "things--and such things: say it all comes from HER!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you dreadful--is that what YOU do?\" cried Francie, shaking herself\r\n",
      "free. The door opened as she spoke and Mme. de Brecourt walked quickly\r\n",
      "to the window, turning her back. Mme. de Cliche was there and Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert and M. de Brecourt and M. de Cliche. They entered in silence and\r\n",
      "M. de Brecourt, coming last, closed the door softly behind him. Francie\r\n",
      "had never been in a court of justice, but if she had had that experience\r\n",
      "these four persons would have reminded her of the jury filing back into\r\n",
      "their box with their verdict. They all looked at her hard as she stood\r\n",
      "in the middle of the room; Mme. de Brecourt gazed out of the window,\r\n",
      "wiping her tears; Mme. de Cliche grasped a newspaper, crumpled and\r\n",
      "partly folded. Francie got a quick impression, moving her eyes from one\r\n",
      "face to another, that old Mr. Probert was the worst; his mild ravaged\r\n",
      "expression was terrible. He was the one who looked at her least; he went\r\n",
      "to the fireplace and leaned on the mantel with his head in his hands. He\r\n",
      "seemed ten years older.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah mademoiselle, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!\" said Maxime de Cliche\r\n",

      "reproach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you seen it--have they sent it to you--?\" his wife asked,\r\n",

      "Francie neither spoke nor took it she tossed it upon the sofa, where, as\r\n",
      "it opened, falling, the girl read the name of the Reverberator. Mme. de\r\n",
      "Cliche carried her head very far aloft.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She has nothing to do with it--it's just as I told you--she's\r\n",
      "overwhelmed,\" said Mme. de Brecourt, remaining at the window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'd do well to read it--it's worth the trouble,\" Alphonse de Brecourt\r\n",
      "remarked, going over to his wife. Francie saw him kiss her as he noted\r\n",
      "her tears. She was angry at her own; she choked and swallowed them; they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you had no idea that any such monstrosity would be perpetrated?\"\r\n",
      "Mme. de Cliche went on, coming nearer to her. She had a manner of forced\r\n",
      "calmness--as if she wished it to be understood that she was one of those\r\n",
      "who could be reasonable under any provocation, though she were trembling\r\n",
      "within--which made Francie draw back. \"C'est pourtant rempli de\r\n",
      "choses--which we know you to have been told of--by what folly, great\r\n",
      "heaven! It's right and left--no one's spared--it's a deluge of the\r\n",
      "lowest insult. My sister perhaps will have told you of the apprehensions\r\n",
      "I had--I couldn't resist them, though I thought of nothing so awful\r\n",
      "as this, God knows--the day I met you at Mr. Waterlow's with your\r\n",
      "journalist.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've told her everything--don't you see she's aneantie? Let her go,\r\n",
      "let her go!\" cried Mme. de Brecourt all distrustfully and still at the\r\n",
      "window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah your journalist, your journalist, mademoiselle!\" said Maxime de\r\n",
      "Cliche. \"I'm very sorry to have to say anything in regard to any friend\r\n",

      "satisfaction of administering him with these hands a dressing he won't\r\n",
      "forget, if I may trouble you so far as to ask you to let him know it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. de Cliche fingered the points of his moustache; he diffused some\r\n",
      "powerful scent; his eyes were dreadful to Francie. She wished Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert would say something kind to her; but she had now determined to\r\n",
      "be strong. They were ever so many against one; Gaston was far away and\r\n",
      "she felt heroic. \"If you mean Mr. Flack--I don't know what you mean,\"\r\n",
      "she said as composedly as possible to M. de Cliche. \"Mr. Flack has gone\r\n",
      "to London.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this M. de Brecourt gave a free laugh and his brother-in-law replied:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"They like such things there; they do them more and more. It's as bad as\r\n",

      "American girl didn't prevent her pretty head from holding itself now as\r\n",
      "high as Mme. de Cliche's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mme. de Brecourt came back to her quickly, laying her hand on her arm.\r\n",
      "\"You're very nervous--you'd much better go home. I'll explain everything\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not in the least nervous, but I've made you all so,\" Francie\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"There's a lady who helps him--Mr. Flack has told me so,\" the girl\r\n",

      "he tells her. I think her name's Miss Topping, but she calls herself\r\n",
      "Florine--or Dorine,\" Francie added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss Dosson, you're too rare!\" Marguerite de Cliche exclaimed, giving a\r\n",
      "long moan of pain which ended in an incongruous laugh. \"Then you've been\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Francie disengaged herself again from Mme. de Brecourt and went to Mr.\r\n",

      "like it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man turned a little, bending his eyes on her, but without taking\r\n",
      "her hand as she had hoped. Usually when they met he kissed her. He\r\n",
      "didn't look angry now, he only looked very ill. A strange, inarticulate\r\n",
      "sound, a chorus of amazement and mirth, came from the others when she\r\n",
      "said she thought they'd like it; and indeed poor Francie was far from\r\n",
      "being able to measure the droll effect of that speech. \"Like it--LIKE\r\n",
      "IT?\" said Mr. Probert, staring at her as if a little afraid of her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean? She admits--she admits!\" Mme. de Cliche exulted to\r\n",
      "her sister. \"Did you arrange it all that day in the Bois--to punish me\r\n",
      "for having tried to separate you?\" she pursued to the poor child, who\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know what he has published--I haven't seen it--I don't\r\n",

      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'About me'!\" M. de Cliche repeated in English. \"Elle est divine!\" He\r\n",
      "turned away, raising his shoulders and hands and then letting them fall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mme. de Brecourt had picked up the newspaper; she rolled it\r\n",
      "together, saying to Francie that she must take it home, take it home\r\n",
      "immediately--then she'd see. She only seemed to wish to get her out of\r\n",
      "the room. But Mr. Probert had fixed their flushed little guest with his\r\n",
      "sick stare. \"You gave information for that? You desired it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why _I_ didn't desire it--but Mr. Flack did.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do you know such ruffians? Where was your father?\" the old man\r\n",

      "interested.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So many people in America--that's just the dreadful thought, my dear,\"\r\n",

      "us what you think of it.\" And she continued to thrust forward the\r\n",
      "scandalous journal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Francie took no notice of it; she looked round from Mr. Probert\r\n",
      "at the others. \"I told Gaston I'd certainly do something you wouldn't\r\n",
      "like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"My poor child, do you think he'll like it any better?\" asked Mme. de\r\n",
      "Brecourt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie turned upon her beautiful dilated eyes in which a world of new\r\n",

      "there--he has seen it now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh my dear, you'll have news of him. Don't be afraid!\" broke in high\r\n",
      "derision from Mme. de Cliche.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Did HE send you the paper?\" her young friend went on to Mr. Probert.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was not directed in his hand,\" M. de Brecourt pronounced. \"There was\r\n",
      "some stamp on the band--it came from the office.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Flack--is that his hideous name?--must have seen to that,\" Mme. de\r\n",
      "Brecourt suggested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Or perhaps Florine,\" M. de Cliche interposed. \"I should like to get\r\n",
      "hold of Florine!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I DID--I did tell him so!\" Francie repeated with all her fevered\r\n",
      "candour, alluding to her statement of a moment before and speaking as if\r\n",
      "she thought the circumstance detracted from the offence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So did I--so did we all!\" said Mme. de Cliche.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And will he suffer--as you suffer?\" Francie continued, appealing to Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Suffer, suffer? He'll die!\" cried the old man. \"However, I won't answer\r\n",
      "for him; he'll tell you himself, when he returns.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll die?\" echoed Francie with the eyes of a child at the pantomime\r\n",
      "who has found the climax turning to demons or monsters or too much\r\n",
      "gunpowder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll never return--how can he show himself?\" said Mme. de Cliche.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's not true--he'll come back to stand by me!\" the girl flashed out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How couldn't you feel us to be the last--the very last?\" asked Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert with great gentleness. \"How couldn't you feel my poor son to be\r\n",
      "the last--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"C'est un sens qui lui manque!\" shrilled implacably Mme. de Cliche.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let her go, papa--do let her go home,\" Mme. de Brecourt pleaded.\r\n",
      "\"Surely. That's the only place for her to-day,\" the elder sister\r\n",
      "continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, my child--you oughtn't to be here. It's your father--he ought to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"For God's sake don't send for him--let it all stop!\" And Mme. de Cliche\r\n",
      "made wild gestures.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie looked at her as she had never looked at any one in her life,\r\n",
      "and then said: \"Good-bye, Mr. Probert--good-bye, Susan.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Give her your arm--take her to the carriage,\" she heard Mme. de\r\n",
      "Brecourt growl to her husband. She got to the door she hardly knew\r\n",
      "how--she was only conscious that Susan held her once more long enough to\r\n",
      "kiss her. Poor Susan wanted to comfort her; that showed how bad--feeling\r\n",
      "as she did--she believed the whole business would yet be. It would be\r\n",
      "bad because Gaston, Gaston--! Francie didn't complete that thought,\r\n",
      "yet only Gaston was in her mind as she hurried to the carriage. M. de\r\n",
      "Brecourt hurried beside her; she wouldn't take his arm. But he opened\r\n",
      "the door for her and as she got in she heard him murmur in the strangest\r\n",
      "and most unexpected manner: \"You're charming, mademoiselle--charming,\r\n",
      "charming!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "XII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her absence had not been long and when she re-entered the familiar salon\r\n",
      "at the hotel she found her father and sister sitting there together\r\n",
      "as if they had timed her by their watches, a prey, both of them, to\r\n",
      "curiosity and suspense. Mr. Dosson however gave no sign of impatience;\r\n",
      "he only looked at her in silence through the smoke of his cigar--he\r\n",
      "profaned the red satin splendour with perpetual fumes--as she burst into\r\n",
      "the room. An irruption she made of her desired reappearance; she rushed\r\n",
      "to one of the tables, flinging down her muff and gloves, while Delia,\r\n",
      "who had sprung up as she came in, caught her closely and glared into her\r\n",
      "face with a \"Francie Dosson, what HAVE you been through?\" Francie said\r\n",
      "nothing at first, only shutting her eyes and letting her sister do what\r\n",
      "she would with her. \"She has been crying, poppa--she HAS,\" Delia almost\r\n",
      "shouted, pulling her down upon a sofa and fairly shaking her as she\r\n",
      "continued. \"Will you please tell? I've been perfectly wild! Yes you\r\n",
      "have, you dreadful--!\" the elder girl insisted, kissing her on the eyes.\r\n",
      "They opened at this compassionate pressure and Francie rested their\r\n",
      "troubled light on her father, who had now risen to his feet and stood\r\n",
      "with his back to the fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, chicken,\" said Mr. Dosson, \"you look as if you had had quite a\r\n",
      "worry.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I told you I should--I told you, I told you!\" Francie broke out with a\r\n",
      "trembling voice. \"And now it's come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say you've DONE anything?\" cried Delia, very white.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's all over, it's all over!\" With which Francie's face braved denial.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you crazy, Francie?\" Delia demanded. \"I'm sure you look as if you\r\n",
      "were.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ain't you going to be married, childie?\" asked Mr. Dosson all\r\n",
      "considerately, but coming nearer to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie sprang up, releasing herself from her sister, and threw her\r\n",
      "arms round him. \"Will you take me away, poppa? will you take me right\r\n",
      "straight away?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I will, my precious. I'll take you anywhere. I don't want\r\n",
      "anything--it wasn't MY idea!\" And Mr. Dosson and Delia looked at each\r\n",
      "other while the girl pressed her face upon his shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I never heard such trash--you can't behave that way! Has he got engaged\r\n",
      "to some one else--in America?\" Delia threw out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why if it's over it's over. I guess it's all right,\" said Mr. Dosson,\r\n",
      "kissing his younger daughter. \"I'll go back or I'll go on. I'll go\r\n",
      "anywhere you like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You won't have your daughters insulted, I presume!\" Delia cried. \"If\r\n",
      "you don't tell me this moment what has happened,\" she pursued to her\r\n",
      "sister, \"I'll drive straight round there and make THEM.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"HAVE they insulted you, sweetie?\" asked the old man, bending over his\r\n",
      "child, who simply leaned on him with her hidden face and no sound of\r\n",
      "tears. Francie raised her head, turning round to their companion. \"Did I\r\n",
      "ever tell you anything else--did I ever believe in it for an hour?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh well, if you've done it on purpose to triumph over me we might as\r\n",
      "well go home, certainly. But I guess,\" Delia added, \"you had better just\r\n",
      "wait till Gaston comes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It will be worse when he comes--if he thinks the same as they do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"HAVE they insulted you--have they?\" Mr. Dosson repeated while the smoke\r\n",
      "of his cigar, curling round the question, gave him the air of putting it\r\n",
      "with placidity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They think I've insulted THEM--they're in an awful state--they're\r\n",
      "almost dead. Mr. Flack has put it into the paper--everything, I\r\n",
      "don't know what--and they think it's too wicked. They were all there\r\n",
      "together--all at me at once, weeping and wailing and gnashing their\r\n",
      "teeth. I never saw people so affected.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia's face grew big with her stare. \"So affected?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah yes, I guess there's a good deal OF THAT,\" said Mr. Dosson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's too real--too terrible; you don't understand. It's all printed\r\n",
      "there--that they're immoral, and everything about them; everything\r\n",
      "that's private and dreadful,\" Francie explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Immoral, is that so?\" Mr. Dosson threw off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And about me too, and about Gaston and my marriage, and all sorts\r\n",
      "of personalities, and all the names, and Mme. de Villepreux, and\r\n",
      "everything. It's all printed there and they've read it. It says one of\r\n",
      "them steals.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Will you be so good as to tell me what you're talking about?\" Delia\r\n",

      "\"Some one sent it, and I told Mr. Flack.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean HIS paper? Oh the horrid ape!\" Delia cried with passion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do they mind so what they see in the papers?\" asked Mr. Dosson. \"I\r\n",
      "guess they haven't seen what I've seen. Why there used to be things\r\n",
      "about ME--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it IS about us too--about every one. They think it's the same as\r\n",

      "common cheer.\r\n",

      "always come?\"\r\n",

      "apparently intended to show that in this case he should know what to do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Francie was looking at her sister as if her attention had been\r\n",
      "arrested. \"How do you mean--'a deep one'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why he wanted to break it off, the fiend!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie stared; then a deeper flush leapt to her face, already mottled\r\n",
      "as with the fine footprints of the Proberts, dancing for pain. \"To break\r\n",
      "off my engagement?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, just that. But I'll be hanged if he shall. Poppa, will you allow\r\n",
      "that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Allow what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why Mr. Flack's vile interference. You won't let him do as he likes\r\n",
      "with us, I suppose, will you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's all done--it's all done!\" said Francie. The tears had suddenly\r\n",
      "started into her eyes again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, he's so smart that it IS likely he's too smart,\" her father\r\n",
      "allowed. \"But what did they want you to do about it?--that's what _I_\r\n",
      "want to know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They wanted me to say I knew nothing about it--but I couldn't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you didn't and you don't--if you haven't even read it!\" Delia\r\n",
      "almost yelled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where IS the d---d thing?\" their companion asked, looking helplessly\r\n",
      "about him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the boulevard, at the very first of those kiosks you come to. That\r\n",
      "old woman has it--the one who speaks English--she always has it. Do go\r\n",
      "and get it--DO!\" And Delia pushed him, looked for his hat for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I knew he wanted to print something and I can't say I didn't!\" Francie\r\n",
      "said. \"I thought he'd crack up my portrait and that Mr. Waterlow would\r\n",
      "like that, and Gaston and every one. And he talked to me about the\r\n",
      "paper--he's always doing that and always was--and I didn't see the harm.\r\n",
      "But even just knowing him--they think that's vile.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I should hope we can know whom we like!\"--and Delia bounced\r\n",
      "fairly round as from the force of her high spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dosson had put on his hat--he was going out for the paper. \"Why he\r\n",
      "kept us alive last year,\" he uttered in tribute.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, he seems to have killed us now,\" Delia cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, don't give up an old friend,\" her father urged with his hand on\r\n",
      "the door. \"And don't back down on anything you've done.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord, what a fuss about an old newspaper!\" Delia went on in her\r\n",
      "exasperation. \"It must be about two weeks old anyway. Didn't they ever\r\n",
      "see a society-paper before?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They can't have seen much,\" said Mr. Dosson. He paused still with his\r\n",
      "hand on the door. \"Don't you worry--Gaston will make it all right.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gaston?--it will kill Gaston!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Gaston will never look at me again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then he'll have to look at ME,\" said Mr. Dosson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean that he'll give you up--he'll be so CRAWLING?\" Delia went\r\n",
      "on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They say he's just the one who'll feel it most. But I'm the one who\r\n",
      "does that,\" said Francie with a strange smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're stuffing you with lies--because THEY don't like it. He'll be\r\n",
      "tender and true,\" Delia glared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When THEY hate me?--Never!\" And Francie shook her head slowly, still\r\n",
      "with her smile of softness. \"That's what he cared for most--to make them\r\n",
      "like me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And isn't he a gentleman, I should like to know?\" asked Delia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and that's why I won't marry him--if I've injured him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shucks! he has seen the papers over there. You wait till he comes,\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson enjoined, passing out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girls remained there together and after a moment Delia resumed.\r\n",
      "\"Well, he has got to fix it--that's one thing I can tell you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who has got to fix it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why that villainous man. He has got to publish another piece saying\r\n",
      "it's all false or all a mistake.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, you'd better make him,\" said Francie with a weak laugh. \"You'd\r\n",
      "better go after him--down to Nice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say he's gone down to Nice?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Didn't he say he was going there as soon as he came back from\r\n",
      "London--going right through without stopping?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know but he did,\" said Delia. Then she added: \"The mean\r\n",
      "coward!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do you say that? He can't hide at Nice--they can find him there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are they going after him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They want to shoot him--to stab him, I don't know what--those men.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I wish they would,\" said Delia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They'd better shoot me. I shall defend him. I shall protect him,\"\r\n",
      "Francie went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can you protect him? You shall never speak to him again!\" her\r\n",
      "sister engaged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie had a pause. \"I can protect him without speaking to him. I can\r\n",
      "tell the simple truth--that he didn't print a word but what I told him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'd like to see him not!\" Delia fairly hooted. \"When did he grow so\r\n",
      "particular? He fixed it up,\" she said with assurance. \"They always do\r\n",
      "in the papers--they'd be ashamed if they didn't. Well now he has got to\r\n",
      "bring out a piece praising them up--praising them to the skies: that's\r\n",
      "what he has got to do!\" she wound up with decision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Praising them up? They'll hate that worse,\" Francie returned musingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia stared. \"What on earth then do they want?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie had sunk to the sofa; her eyes were fixed on the carpet. She\r\n",
      "gave no reply to this question but presently said: \"We had better go\r\n",
      "to-morrow, the first hour that's possible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go where? Do you mean to Nice?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't care where. Anywhere to get away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Before Gaston comes--without seeing him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't want to see him. When they were all ranting and raving at me\r\n",
      "just now I wished he was there--I told them so. But now I don't feel\r\n",
      "like that--I can never see him again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't suppose YOU'RE crazy, are you?\" Delia returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can't tell him it wasn't me--I can't, I can't!\" her companion went\r\n",
      "on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia planted herself in front of her. \"Francie Dosson, if you're going\r\n",

      "begin. Didn't you hear how poppa put it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I don't know,\" Francie said listlessly.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Then he'll be worse than a worm.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not in the least--he'll give me up as he took me. He'd never have asked\r\n",
      "me to marry him if he hadn't been able to get THEM to accept me: he\r\n",
      "thinks everything in life of THEM. If they cast me off now he'll do just\r\n",
      "the same. He'll have to choose between us, and when it comes to that\r\n",
      "he'll never choose me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll never choose Mr. Flack, if that's what you mean--if you're going\r\n",
      "to identify yourself so with HIM!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I wish he'd never been born!\" Francie wailed; after which she\r\n",
      "suddenly shivered. And then she added that she was sick--she was going\r\n",
      "to bed, and her sister took her off to her room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dosson that afternoon, sitting by his younger daughter's bedside,\r\n",
      "read the dreadful \"piece\" out to both his children from the copy of the\r\n",
      "Reverberator he had secured on the boulevard. It is a remarkable fact\r\n",
      "that as a family they were rather disappointed in this composition, in\r\n",
      "which their curiosity found less to repay it than it had expected, their\r\n",
      "resentment against Mr. Flack less to stimulate it, their fluttering\r\n",
      "effort to take the point of view of the Proberts less to sustain it, and\r\n",
      "their acceptance of the promulgation of Francie's innocent remarks as a\r\n",
      "natural incident of the life of the day less to make them reconsider it.\r\n",
      "The letter from Paris appeared lively, \"chatty,\" highly calculated to\r\n",
      "please, and so far as the personalities contained in it were concerned\r\n",
      "Mr. Dosson wanted to know if they weren't aware over here of the charges\r\n",
      "brought every day against the most prominent men in Boston. \"If there\r\n",
      "was anything in that style they might talk,\" he said; and he scanned\r\n",
      "the effusion afresh with a certain surprise at not finding in it some\r\n",
      "imputation of pecuniary malversation. The effect of an acquaintance with\r\n",
      "the text was to depress Delia, who didn't exactly see what there was in\r\n",
      "it to take back or explain away. However, she was aware there were some\r\n",
      "points they didn't understand, and doubtless these were the scandalous\r\n",
      "places--the things that had so worked up the Proberts. But why should\r\n",
      "they have minded if other people didn't understand the allusions (these\r\n",
      "were peculiar, but peculiarly incomprehensible) any better than she did?\r\n",
      "The whole thing struck Francie herself as infinitely less lurid than\r\n",
      "Mme. de Brecourt's account of it, and the part about her own situation\r\n",
      "and her beautiful picture seemed to make even less of the subject than\r\n",
      "it easily might have done. It was scanty, it was \"skimpy,\" and if Mr.\r\n",
      "Waterlow was offended it wouldn't be because they had published too much\r\n",
      "about him. It was nevertheless clear to her that there were a lot of\r\n",
      "things SHE hadn't told Mr. Flack, as well as a great many she had:\r\n",
      "perhaps those were the things that lady had put in--Florine or\r\n",
      "Dorine--the one she had mentioned at Mme. de Brecourt's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the same, if the communication in the Reverberator let them down, at\r\n",
      "the hotel, more gently than had seemed likely and bristled so much less\r\n",
      "than was to have been feared with explanations of the anguish of the\r\n",
      "Proberts, this didn't diminish the girl's sense of responsibility\r\n",
      "nor make the case a whit less grave. It only showed how sensitive and\r\n",
      "fastidious the Proberts were and therefore with what difficulty they\r\n",
      "would come round to condonation. Moreover Francie made another reflexion\r\n",
      "as she lay there--for Delia kept her in bed nearly three days, feeling\r\n",
      "this to be for the moment at any rate an effectual reply to any absurd\r\n",
      "heroics about leaving Paris. Perhaps they had got \"case-hardened\"\r\n",
      "Francie said to herself; perhaps they had read so many such bad things\r\n",
      "that they had lost the delicacy of their palate, as people were said to\r\n",
      "do who lived on food too violently spiced. Then, very weak and vague and\r\n",
      "passive as she was now, in the bedimmed room, in the soft Parisian bed\r\n",
      "and with Delia treating her as much as possible like a sick person, she\r\n",
      "thought of the lively and chatty letters they had always seen in the\r\n",
      "papers and wondered if they ALL meant a violation of sanctities, a\r\n",
      "convulsion of homes, a burning of smitten faces, a rupture of girls'\r\n",
      "engagements. It was present to her as an agreeable negative, I must add,\r\n",
      "that her father and sister took no strenuous view of her responsibility\r\n",
      "or of their own: they neither brought the matter home to her as a crime\r\n",
      "nor made her worse through her feeling them anxiously understate their\r\n",
      "blame. There was a pleasant cheerful helplessness in her father on this\r\n",
      "head as on every other. There could be no more discussion among them on\r\n",
      "such a question than there had ever been, for none was needed to show\r\n",
      "that for these candid minds the newspapers and all they contained were\r\n",
      "a part of the general fatality of things, of the recurrent freshness\r\n",
      "of the universe, coming out like the sun in the morning or the stars at\r\n",
      "night or the wind and the weather at all times.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thing that worried Francie most while Delia kept her in bed was the\r\n",
      "apprehension of what her father might do; but this was not a fear\r\n",
      "of what he might do to Mr. Flack. He would go round perhaps to Mr.\r\n",
      "Probert's or to Mme. de Brecourt's and reprimand them for having made\r\n",
      "things so rough to his \"chicken.\" It was true she had scarcely ever seen\r\n",
      "him reprimand any one for anything; but on the other hand nothing like\r\n",
      "this had ever happened before to her or to Delia. They had made each\r\n",
      "other cry once or twice, but no one else had ever made them, and no one\r\n",
      "had ever broken out on them that way and frightened them half to death.\r\n",
      "Francie wanted her father not to go round; she had a sense that\r\n",
      "those other people had somehow stores of comparison, of propriety, of\r\n",
      "superiority, in any discussion, which he couldn't command. She wanted\r\n",
      "nothing done and no communication to pass--only a proud unbickering\r\n",
      "silence on the part of the Dossons. If the Proberts made a noise and\r\n",
      "they made none it would be they who would have the best appearance.\r\n",
      "Moreover now, with each elapsing day, she felt she did wish to see\r\n",
      "Gaston about it. Her desire was to wait, counting the hours, so that she\r\n",
      "might just clearly explain, saying two or three things. Perhaps these\r\n",
      "things wouldn't make it better--very likely they wouldn't; but at any\r\n",
      "rate nothing would have been done in the interval, at least on her part\r\n",
      "and her father's and Delia's, to make it worse. She told her father that\r\n",
      "she wouldn't, as Delia put it, \"want to have him\" go round, and was in\r\n",
      "some degree relieved at perceiving that he didn't seem very clear as\r\n",
      "to what it was open to him to say to their alienated friends. He wasn't\r\n",
      "afraid but was uncertain. His relation to almost everything that had\r\n",
      "happened to them as a family from a good while back was a sense of the\r\n",
      "absence of precedents, and precedents were particularly absent now, for\r\n",
      "he had never before seen a lot of people in a rage about a piece in the\r\n",
      "paper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delia also reassured her; she said she'd see to it that poppa didn't\r\n",
      "sneak round. She communicated to her indeed that he hadn't the smallest\r\n",
      "doubt that Gaston, in a few days, would blow them up--all THEM down\r\n",
      "there--much higher than they had blown her, and that he was very sorry\r\n",
      "he had let her go down herself on that sort of summons. It was for her\r\n",
      "and the rest to come to Francie and to him, and if they had anything\r\n",
      "practical to say they'd arrive in a body yet. If Mr. Dosson had the\r\n",
      "sense of his daughter's having been roughly handled he derived some of\r\n",
      "the consolation of amusement from his persistent humorous view of the\r\n",
      "Proberts as a \"body.\" If they were consistent with their character or\r\n",
      "with their complaint they would move en masse upon the hotel, and he\r\n",
      "hung about at home a good deal as if to wait for them. Delia intimated\r\n",
      "to her sister that this vision cheered them up as they sat, they two, in\r\n",
      "the red salon while Francie was in bed. Of course it didn't exhilarate\r\n",
      "this young lady, and she even looked for no brighter side now. She knew\r\n",
      "almost nothing but her sharp little ache of suspense, her presentiment\r\n",
      "of Gaston's horror, which grew all the while. Delia remarked to her once\r\n",
      "that he would have seen lots of society-papers over there, he would have\r\n",
      "become familiar; but this only suggested to the girl--she had at present\r\n",
      "strange new moments and impulses of quick reasoning--that they would\r\n",
      "only prepare him to be disgusted, not to be indifferent. His disgust\r\n",
      "would be colder than anything she had ever known and would complete her\r\n",
      "knowledge of him--make her understand him properly for the first time.\r\n",
      "She would just meet it as briefly as possible; it would wind up the\r\n",
      "business, close the incident, and all would be over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He didn't write; that proved it in advance; there had now been two or\r\n",
      "three mails without a letter. He had seen the paper in Boston or in New\r\n",
      "York and it had simply struck him dumb. It was very well for Delia to\r\n",
      "say that of course he didn't write when he was on the ocean: how could\r\n",
      "they get his letters even if he did? There had been time before--before\r\n",
      "he sailed; though Delia represented that people never wrote then. They\r\n",
      "were ever so much too busy at the last and were going to see their\r\n",
      "correspondents in a few days anyway. The only missives that came to\r\n",
      "Francie were a copy of the Reverberator, addressed in Mr. Flack's hand\r\n",
      "and with a great inkmark on the margin of the fatal letter, and three\r\n",
      "intense pages from Mme. de Brecourt, received forty-eight hours after\r\n",
      "the scene at her house. This lady expressed herself as follows:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "MY DEAR FRANCIE--I felt very badly after you had gone yesterday morning,\r\n",
      "and I had twenty minds to go and see you. But we've talked it over\r\n",
      "conscientiously and it appears to us that we've no right to take any\r\n",
      "such step till Gaston arrives. The situation isn't exclusively ours but\r\n",
      "belongs to him as well, and we feel we ought to make it over to him in\r\n",
      "as simple and compact a form as possible. Therefore, as we regard it, we\r\n",
      "had better not touch it (it's so delicate, isn't it, my poor child?) but\r\n",
      "leave it just as it is. They think I even exceed my powers in writing\r\n",
      "you these simple lines, and that once your participation has been\r\n",
      "constatee (which was the only advantage of that dreadful scene)\r\n",
      "EVERYTHING should stop. But I've liked you, Francie, I've believed\r\n",
      "in you, and I don't wish you to be able to say that in spite of\r\n",
      "the thunderbolt you've drawn down on us I've not treated you with\r\n",
      "tenderness. It's a thunderbolt indeed, my poor and innocent but\r\n",
      "disastrous little friend! We're hearing more of it already--the horrible\r\n",
      "Republican papers here have (AS WE KNOW) already got hold of the\r\n",
      "unspeakable sheet and are preparing to reproduce the article: that\r\n",
      "is such parts of it as they may put forward (with innuendoes and\r\n",

      "perfidious extracts. His father hadn't stirred out of the house, hadn't\r\n",

      "were immediately to start for England on an indefinite absence. They\r\n",

      "confirm. He would come in as soon after nine as possible; the day up to\r\n",
      "that time would be stiff in the Cours la Reine, and he begged her in the\r\n",
      "meantime not to doubt of his perfect tenderness. So far from her having\r\n",

      "morsels of silk and ribbon in her lap, several pins in her mouth, and\r\n",
      "her attention turning constantly from her work to her sister's face. The\r\n",
      "weather was now so completely vernal that Mr. Dosson was able to haunt\r\n",
      "the court, and he had lately resumed this practice, in which he was\r\n",
      "presumably at the present moment absorbed. Delia had lowered her needle\r\n",
      "and was making sure if her companion were awake--she had been perfectly\r\n",
      "still for so long--when her glance was drawn to the door, which she\r\n",
      "heard pushed open. Mr. Flack stood there, looking from one to the other\r\n",
      "of the young ladies as to see which would be most agreeably surprised by\r\n",
      "his visit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"All right--ALL RIGHT?\" Delia Dosson repeated, springing up. \"Yes\r\n",

      "she had not been asleep by the quick consciousness with which she raised\r\n",
      "herself on her sofa. She gazed at the visitor with parted lips,\r\n",
      "but uttered no word. He barely faltered, coming toward her with his\r\n",
      "conscious grimace and his hand out. His knowing eyes were more knowing\r\n",
      "than ever, but had an odd appearance of being smaller, like penetrating\r\n",
      "points. \"Your father has told me all about it. Did you ever hear of\r\n",
      "anything so cheap?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All about what?--all about what?\" said Delia, whose attempt to\r\n",
      "represent happy ignorance was menaced by an intromission of ferocity.\r\n",
      "She might succeed in appearing ignorant, but could scarcely succeed in\r\n",
      "appearing kind. Francie had risen to her feet and had suffered Mr. Flack\r\n",
      "to possess himself for a moment of her hand, but neither of them had\r\n",
      "asked the young man to sit down. \"I thought you were going to stay a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Comfortable? of course we can!\" cried Delia, but she remained erect\r\n",
      "while Francie sank upon the sofa again and their companion took\r\n",
      "possession of the nearest chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you remember what I told you once, that the people WILL have the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She looked an instant as if she were trying to recollect what he had\r\n",
      "told her; and then said, more remotely, \"DID father write to you?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"He told me the Reverberator has raised a breeze. I guessed that for\r\n",
      "myself when I saw the way the papers here were after it. That thing will\r\n",
      "go the rounds, you'll see. What brought me was learning from him that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It has done the paper more good than anything--every one's so\r\n",
      "interested,\" said Mr. Flack in the tone of reasonable explanation. \"And\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean because I told you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why certainly. Didn't it all spring out of that lovely drive and that\r\n",

      "Didn't you understand that I wanted you to know that the public would\r\n",

      "uncommunicated plan, on Mr. Dosson's part was unnatural and alarming;\r\n",
      "and there was further provocation in his appearing to shirk the\r\n",
      "responsibility of it by not having come up at such a moment with his\r\n",
      "accomplice. Delia was impatient to know what he wanted anyway. Did\r\n",
      "he want to drag them down again to such commonness--ah she felt the\r\n",
      "commonness now!--even though it COULD hustle? Did he want to put Mr.\r\n",
      "Flack forward, with a feeble flourish that didn't answer one of their\r\n",
      "questions, as a substitute for the alienated Gaston? If she hadn't been\r\n",
      "afraid that something still more uncanny than anything that had happened\r\n",
      "yet might come to pass between her two companions in case of her leaving\r\n",
      "them together she would have darted down to the court to appease her\r\n",
      "conjectures, to challenge her father and tell him how particularly\r\n",
      "pleased she should be if he wouldn't put in his oar. She felt liberated,\r\n",
      "however, the next moment, for something occurred that struck her as a\r\n",
      "sure proof of the state of her sister's spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you know the view I take of the matter, according to what your\r\n",
      "father has told me?\" Mr. Flack enquired. \"I don't mean it was he gave me\r\n",
      "the tip; I guess I've seen enough over here by this time to have worked\r\n",
      "it out. They're scandalised all right--they're blue with horror and have\r\n",
      "never heard of anything so dreadful. Miss Francie,\" her visitor roared,\r\n",
      "\"that ain't good enough for you and me. They know what's in the papers\r\n",
      "every day of their lives and they know how it got there. They ain't like\r\n",
      "the fellow in the story--who was he?--who couldn't think how the\r\n",
      "apples got into the dumplings. They're just grabbing a pretext to break\r\n",
      "because--because, well, they don't think you're blue blood. They're\r\n",
      "delighted to strike a pretext they can work, and they're all cackling\r\n",
      "over the egg it has taken so many hens of 'em to lay. That's MY\r\n",
      "diagnosis if you want to know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh--how can you say such a thing?\" Francie returned with a tremor\r\n",
      "in her voice that struck her sister. Her eyes met Delia's at the same\r\n",
      "moment, and this young woman's heart bounded with the sense that she was\r\n",
      "safe. Mr. Flack's power to hustle presumed too far--though Mr. Dosson\r\n",
      "had crude notions about the licence of the press she felt, even as an\r\n",
      "untutored woman, what a false step he was now taking--and it seemed to\r\n",
      "her that Francie, who was not impressed (the particular light in her\r\n",
      "eyes now showed it) could be trusted to allow him no benefit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What does it matter what he says, my dear?\" she interposed. \"Do make\r\n",
      "him drop the subject--he's talking very wild. I'm going down to see what\r\n",
      "poppa means--I never heard of anything so flat!\" At the door she paused\r\n",
      "a moment to add mutely, by mere facial force: \"Now just wipe him out,\r\n",
      "mind!\" It was the same injunction she had launched at her from afar that\r\n",
      "day, a year before, when they all dined at Saint-Germain, and she could\r\n",
      "remember how effective it had then been. The next moment she flirted\r\n",
      "out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as she had gone Mr. Flack moved nearer to Francie. \"Now look\r\n",

      "behind me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"You told them so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When they were all crying and going on. I told them I knew it--I told\r\n",
      "them I gave you the tip as you call it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She felt Mr. Flack fix her all alarmingly as she spoke these words;\r\n",
      "then he was still nearer to her--he had taken her hand. \"Ah you're too\r\n",
      "sweet!\" She disengaged her hand and in the effort she sprang up; but\r\n",
      "he, rising too, seemed to press always nearer--she had a sense (it was\r\n",
      "disagreeable) that he was demonstrative--so that she retreated a little\r\n",
      "before him. \"They were all there roaring and raging, trying to make you\r\n",

      "and the countess and the duchess and his French brothers-in-law from\r\n",
      "whom he takes lessons: he'll just back down, he'll give you up.\"\r\n",

      "He waited a little, interestedly. \"Do you think I took any advantage?\"\r\n",

      "She made no answer at first, but after a moment said in a tone he had\r\n",
      "never heard from her: \"Why do you come here this way? Why do you ask me\r\n",
      "such questions?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Oh PLEASE don't!\" she almost moaned, turning away.\r\n",

      "round--the heartless brutes they've turned into, and the way OUR life,\r\n",
      "yours and mine, is bound to be the same? Don't you see the damned\r\n",
      "sneaking scorn with which they treat you and that _I_ only want to do\r\n",
      "anything in the world for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie's white face, very quiet now, let all this pass without a sign\r\n",
      "of satisfaction. Her only response was presently to say: \"Why did you\r\n",
      "ask me so many questions that day?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because I always ask questions--it's my nature and my business to ask\r\n",
      "them. Haven't you always seen me ask you and ask every one all I could?\r\n",
      "Don't you know they're the very foundation of my work? I thought you\r\n",
      "sympathised with my work so much--you used to tell me you did.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I did,\" she allowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You put it in the dead past, I see. You don't then any more?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If this remark was on her visitor's part the sign of a rare assurance\r\n",
      "the girl's cold mildness was still unruffled by it. She considered, she\r\n",
      "even smiled; then she replied: \"Oh yes I do--only not so much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They HAVE worked on you; but I should have thought they'd have\r\n",
      "disgusted you. I don't care--even a little sympathy will do: whatever\r\n",
      "you've got left.\" He paused, looking at her, but it was a speech she had\r\n",
      "nothing for; so he went on: \"There was no obligation for you to answer\r\n",
      "my questions--you might have shut me up that day with a word.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Really?\" she asked with all her grave good faith in her face. \"I\r\n",
      "thought I HAD to--for fear I should appear ungrateful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ungrateful?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why to you--after what you had done. Don't you remember that it was you\r\n",
      "who introduced us--?\" And she paused with a fatigued delicacy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not to those snobs who are screaming like frightened peacocks. I beg\r\n",
      "your pardon--I haven't THAT on my conscience!\" Mr. Flack quite grandly\r\n",
      "declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you introduced us to Mr. Waterlow and he introduced us to--to\r\n",
      "his friends,\" she explained, colouring, as if it were a fault for the\r\n",
      "inexactness caused by her magnanimity. \"That's why I thought I ought to\r\n",
      "tell you what you'd like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, do you suppose if I'd known where that first visit of ours to\r\n",
      "Waterlow was going to bring you out I'd have taken you within fifty\r\n",
      "miles--?\" He stopped suddenly; then in another tone: \"Jerusalem, there's\r\n",
      "no one like you! And you told them it was all YOU?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind what I told them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss Francie,\" said George Flack, \"if you'll marry me I'll never ask a\r\n",
      "question again. I'll go into some other business.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you didn't do it on purpose?\" Francie asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On purpose?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To get me into a quarrel with them--so that I might be free again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, of all the blamed ideas--!\" the young man gasped. \"YOUR pure mind\r\n",
      "never gave birth to that--it was your sister's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wasn't it natural it should occur to me, since if, as you say, you'd\r\n",
      "never consciously have been the means--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but I WAS the means!\" Mr. Flack interrupted. \"We must go, after all,\r\n",
      "by what DID happen.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I thanked you when I drove with you and let you draw me out.\r\n",
      "So we're square, aren't we?\" The term Francie used was a colloquialism\r\n",
      "generally associated with levity, but her face, as she spoke, was none\r\n",
      "the less deeply serious--serious even to pain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We're square?\" he repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think you ought to ask for anything more. Good-bye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye? Never!\" cried George Flack, who flushed with his defeat to a\r\n",
      "degree that spoke strangely of his hopes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something in the way she repeated her \"Goodbye!\" betrayed her impression\r\n",
      "of this, and not a little withal that so much confidence left her\r\n",
      "unflattered. \"Do go away!\" she broke out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'll come back very soon\"--and he took up his hat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Please don't--I don't like it.\" She had now contrived to put a wide\r\n",
      "space between them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you tormentress!\" he groaned. He went toward the door, but before he\r\n",
      "reached it turned round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Will you tell me this anyway? ARE you going to marry the lot--after\r\n",
      "this?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you want to put that in the paper?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I do--and say you said it!\" Mr. Flack held up his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "ain't. There!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's all right,\" he said as he went out.\r\n",

      "XIV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Gaston Probert came that evening he was received by Dosson and\r\n",
      "Delia, and when he asked where Francie might be was told by the latter\r\n",
      "that she would show herself in half an hour. Francie had instructed her\r\n",
      "sister that as their friend would have, first of all, information to\r\n",
      "give their father about the business he had transacted in America he\r\n",
      "wouldn't care for a lot of women in the room. When Delia reported this\r\n",
      "speech to Mr. Dosson that gentleman protested that he wasn't in any\r\n",
      "hurry for the business; what he wanted to find out most was whether\r\n",
      "Mr. Probert had a good time--whether he had liked it over there. Gaston\r\n",
      "might have liked it, but he didn't look as if he had had a very good\r\n",
      "time. His face told of reverses, of suffering; and Delia declared to him\r\n",
      "that if she hadn't received his assurance to the contrary she would have\r\n",
      "believed he was right down sick. He allowed that he had been very sick\r\n",
      "at sea and was still feeling the effect of it, but insisted that there\r\n",
      "was nothing the matter with him now. He sat for some time with Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson and Delia, and never once alluded to the cloud that hung over\r\n",
      "their relations. The girl had schooled her father to a waiting attitude\r\n",
      "on this point, and the manner in which she had descended on him in\r\n",
      "the morning, after Mr. Flack had come upstairs, was a lesson he wasn't\r\n",
      "likely soon to forget. It had been impressed on him that she was indeed\r\n",
      "wiser than he could pretend to be, and he was now mindful that he\r\n",
      "mustn't speak of the \"piece in the paper\" unless young Probert should\r\n",
      "speak of it first. When Delia rushed down to him in the court she began\r\n",
      "by asking him categorically whom he had wished to do good to by sending\r\n",
      "Mr. Flack up to their parlour. To Francie or to her? Why the way they\r\n",
      "felt then, they detested his very name. To Mr. Flack himself? Why he had\r\n",
      "simply exposed him to the biggest snub he had ever got in his life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, hanged if I understand!\" poor Mr. Dosson had said. \"I thought you\r\n",
      "liked the piece--you think it's so queer THEY don't like it.\" \"They,\" in\r\n",
      "the parlance of the Dossons, now never meant anything but the Proberts\r\n",
      "in congress assembled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think anything's queer but you!\" Delia had retorted; and she\r\n",
      "had let her father know that she had left Francie in the very act of\r\n",
      "\"handling\" Mr. Flack.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that so?\" the old gentleman had quavered in an impotence that made\r\n",
      "him wince with a sense of meanness--meanness to his bold initiator of so\r\n",
      "many Parisian hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie's visitor came down a few minutes later and passed through the\r\n",
      "court and out of the hotel without looking at them. Mr. Dosson had been\r\n",
      "going to call after him, but Delia checked him with a violent pinch.\r\n",
      "The unsociable manner of the young journalist's departure deepened Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson's dull ache over the mystery of things. I think this may be said\r\n",
      "to have been the only incident in the whole business that gave him a\r\n",
      "personal pang. He remembered how many of his cigars he had smoked\r\n",
      "with Mr. Flack and how universal a participant he had made him. This\r\n",
      "haughtiness struck him as the failure of friendship--not the publication\r\n",
      "of details about the Proberts. Interwoven with Mr. Dosson's nature\r\n",
      "was the view that if these people had done bad things they ought to be\r\n",
      "ashamed of themselves and he couldn't pity them, and that if they hadn't\r\n",
      "done them there was no need of making such a rumpus about other people's\r\n",
      "knowing. It was therefore, in spite of the young man's rough exit, still\r\n",
      "in the tone of American condonation that he had observed to Delia: \"He\r\n",
      "says that's what they like over there and that it stands to reason that\r\n",
      "if you start a paper you've got to give them what they like. If you want\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At one of the ormolu tables, near a lamp with a pink shade, Gaston\r\n",
      "insisted on making at least a partial statement. He didn't say that he\r\n",
      "might never have another chance, but Delia felt with despair that this\r\n",
      "idea was in his mind. He was very gentle, very polite, but distinctly\r\n",
      "cold, she thought; he was intensely depressed and for half an hour\r\n",
      "uttered not the least little pleasantry. There was no particular\r\n",
      "occasion for that when he talked about \"preferred bonds\" with her\r\n",
      "father. This was a language Delia couldn't translate, though she had\r\n",
      "heard it from childhood. He had a great many papers to show Mr. Dosson,\r\n",
      "records of the mission of which he had acquitted himself, but Mr. Dosson\r\n",
      "pushed them into the drawer of the ormolu table with the remark that he\r\n",
      "guessed they were all right. Now, after the fact, he appeared to attach\r\n",
      "but little importance to Gaston's achievements--an attitude which\r\n",
      "Delia perceived to be slightly disconcerting to their visitor. Delia\r\n",
      "understood it: she had an instinctive sense that her father knew a\r\n",
      "great deal more than Gaston could tell him even about the work he had\r\n",
      "committed to him, and also that there was in such punctual settlements\r\n",
      "an eagerness, a literalism, totally foreign to Mr. Dosson's domestic\r\n",
      "habits and to which he would even have imputed a certain pettifogging\r\n",
      "provinciality--treatable however with dry humour. If Gaston had cooled\r\n",
      "off he wanted at least to be able to say that he had rendered them\r\n",
      "services in America; but now her father, for the moment at least,\r\n",
      "scarcely appeared to think his services worth speaking of: an incident\r\n",
      "that left him with more of the responsibility for his cooling. What\r\n",
      "Mr. Dosson wanted to know was how everything had struck him over there,\r\n",
      "especially the Pickett Building and the parlour-cars and Niagara and the\r\n",
      "hotels he had instructed him to go to, giving him an introduction in\r\n",
      "two or three cases to the gentleman in charge of the office. It was in\r\n",
      "relation to these themes that Gaston was guilty of a want of spring, as\r\n",
      "the girl phrased it to herself; that he could produce no appreciative\r\n",
      "expression. He declared however, repeatedly, that it was a most\r\n",
      "extraordinary country--most extraordinary and far beyond anything he had\r\n",
      "had any conception of. \"Of course I didn't like EVERYTHING,\" he said,\r\n",
      "\"any more than I like everything anywhere.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what didn't you like?\" Mr. Dosson enquired, at this, after a\r\n",
      "short silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaston Probert made his choice. \"Well, the light for instance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The light--the electric?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, the solar! I thought it rather hard, too much like the scratching\r\n",
      "of a slate-pencil.\" As Mr. Dosson hereupon looked vague and rather as if\r\n",
      "the reference were to some enterprise (a great lamp company) of which he\r\n",
      "had not heard--conveying a suggestion that he was perhaps staying away\r\n",
      "too long, Gaston immediately added: \"I really think Francie might come\r\n",
      "in. I wrote to her that I wanted particularly to see her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll go and call her--I'll make her come,\" said Delia at the door. She\r\n",
      "left her companions together and Gaston returned to the subject of Mr.\r\n",
      "Munster, Mr. Dosson's former partner, to whom he had taken a letter\r\n",
      "and who had shown him every sort of civility. Mr. Dosson was pleased at\r\n",
      "this; nevertheless he broke out suddenly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look here, you know; if you've got anything to say that you don't think\r\n",
      "very acceptable you had better say it to ME.\" Gaston changed colour, but\r\n",
      "his reply was checked by Delia's quick return. She brought the news\r\n",
      "that her sister would be obliged if he would go into the little\r\n",
      "dining-room--he would find her there. She had something for his ear that\r\n",
      "she could mention only in private. It was very comfortable; there was\r\n",
      "a lamp and a fire. \"Well, I guess she CAN take care of herself!\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson, at this, commented with a laugh. \"What does she want to say to\r\n",
      "him?\" he asked when Gaston had passed out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gracious knows! She won't tell me. But it's too flat, at his age, to\r\n",
      "live in such terror.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In such terror?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why of your father. You've got to choose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How, to choose?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why if there's a person you like and he doesn't like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean you can't choose your father,\" said Mr. Dosson thoughtfully.\r\n",

      "\"Of course you can't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then please don't like any one. But perhaps _I_ should like him,\"\r\n",
      "he added, faithful to his easier philosophy.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In the small salle-a-manger, when Gaston went in, Francie was standing\r\n",

      "door was not the one that led to the salon; it communicated with the\r\n",
      "other apartments. The girl had plunged into these--he already heard her\r\n",
      "push a sharp bolt. Presently he went away without taking leave of Mr.\r\n",
      "Dosson and Delia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why he acts just like Mr. Flack,\" said the old man when they discovered\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The next day was a bad one for Charles Waterlow, his work in the Avenue\r\n",
      "de Villiers being terribly interrupted. Gaston Probert invited himself\r\n",
      "to breakfast at noon and remained till the time at which the artist\r\n",
      "usually went out--an extravagance partly justified by the previous\r\n",
      "separation of several weeks. During these three or four hours Gaston\r\n",
      "walked up and down the studio while Waterlow either sat or stood before\r\n",
      "his easel. He put his host vastly out and acted on his nerves, but this\r\n",
      "easy genius was patient with him by reason of much pity, feeling the\r\n",
      "occasion indeed more of a crisis in the history of the troubled youth\r\n",
      "than the settlement of one question would make it. Waterlow's compassion\r\n",
      "was slightly tinged with contempt, for there was being settled above\r\n",
      "all, it seemed to him, and, alas, in the wrong sense, the question of\r\n",
      "his poor friend's character. Gaston was in a fever; he broke out into\r\n",
      "passionate pleas--he relapsed into gloomy silences. He roamed about\r\n",
      "continually, his hands in his pockets and his hair in a tangle; he could\r\n",
      "take neither a decision nor a momentary rest. It struck his companion\r\n",
      "more than ever before that he was after all essentially a foreigner;\r\n",
      "he had the foreign sensibility, the sentimental candour, the need for\r\n",
      "sympathy, the communicative despair. A true young Anglo-Saxon would have\r\n",
      "buttoned himself up in his embarrassment and been dry and awkward and\r\n",
      "capable, and, however conscious of a pressure, unconscious of a\r\n",
      "drama; whereas Gaston was effusive and appealing and ridiculous and\r\n",
      "graceful--natural above all and egotistical. Indeed a true young\r\n",
      "Anglo-Saxon wouldn't have known the particular acuteness of such a\r\n",
      "quandary, for he wouldn't have parted to such an extent with his freedom\r\n",
      "of spirit. It was the fact of this surrender on his visitor's part that\r\n",
      "excited Waterlow's secret scorn: family feeling was all very well, but\r\n",
      "to see it triumph as a superstition calling for the blood-sacrifice made\r\n",
      "him feel he would as soon be a blackamoor on his knees before a fetish.\r\n",
      "He now measured for the first time the root it had taken in Gaston's\r\n",
      "nature. To act like a man the hope of the Proberts must pull up the\r\n",
      "root, even if the operation should be terribly painful, should be\r\n",
      "attended with cries and tears and contortions, with baffling scruples\r\n",
      "and a sense of sacrilege, the sense of siding with strangers against his\r\n",
      "own flesh and blood. Now and again he broke out: \"And if you should see\r\n",
      "her as she looks just now--she's too lovely, too touching!--you'd see\r\n",
      "how right I was originally, when I found her such a revelation of that\r\n",
      "rare type, the French Renaissance, you know, the one we talked about.\"\r\n",
      "But he reverted with at least equal frequency to the oppression he\r\n",
      "seemed unable to throw off, the idea of something done of cruel purpose\r\n",
      "and malice, with a refinement of outrage: such an accident to THEM, of\r\n",
      "all people on earth, the very last, the least thinkable, those who, he\r\n",
      "verily believed, would feel it more than any family in the world. When\r\n",
      "Waterlow asked what made them of so exceptionally fine a fibre he could\r\n",
      "only answer that they just happened to be--not enviably, if one would;\r\n",
      "it was his father's influence and example, his very genius, the worship\r\n",
      "of privacy and good manners, a hatred of all the new familiarities and\r\n",
      "profanations. The artist sought to know further, at last and rather\r\n",
      "wearily, what in two words was the practical question his friend desired\r\n",
      "he should consider. Whether he should be justified in throwing the girl\r\n",
      "over--was that the issue?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gracious goodness, no! For what sort of sneak do you take me? She made\r\n",
      "a mistake, but any innocent young creature might do that. It's whether\r\n",
      "it strikes you I should be justified in throwing THEM over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It depends upon the sense you attach to justification.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean should I be miserably unhappy? Would it be in their power to\r\n",
      "make me so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To try--certainly, if they're capable of anything so nasty. The only\r\n",
      "fair play for them is to let you alone,\" Waterlow wound up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, they won't do that--they like me too much!\" Gaston ingenuously\r\n",
      "cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's an odd way of liking! The best way to show their love will be to\r\n",
      "let you marry where your affections, and so many other charming things,\r\n",
      "are involved.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly--only they question the charming things. They feel she\r\n",

      "possibilities of doing other dreadful things, that it's upon THEM--I\r\n",
      "mean on those things--my happiness would be shattered.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" the elder man rather dryly said, \"if you yourself have no\r\n",

      "one.\"\r\n",

      "\"Yes, I ought to do it myself,\" Gaston allowed in the candour of his\r\n",
      "meditations. Then he went on in his torment of hesitation: \"They never\r\n",
      "believed in her from the first. My father was perfectly definite about\r\n",
      "it. At heart they never accepted her; they only pretended to do so\r\n",
      "because I guaranteed her INSTINCTS--that's what I did, heaven help me!\r\n",
      "and that she was incapable of doing a thing that could ever displease\r\n",
      "them. Then no sooner was my back turned than she perpetrated that!\"\r\n",

      "\"You'd have thought her capable--?\"\r\n",

      "\"Capabilissima! And I shouldn't have cared.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you think her then capable of breaking out again in some new way\r\n",

      "his work and looking up--\"don't you see that the question of her\r\n",
      "possibilities is as nothing compared to that of yours? She's the\r\n",
      "sweetest young thing I ever saw; but even if she happened not to be I\r\n",
      "should still urge you to marry her, in simple self-preservation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaston kept echoing. \"In self-preservation?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To save from destruction the last scrap of your independence. That's a\r\n",
      "much more important matter even than not treating her shabbily. They're\r\n",
      "doing their best to kill you morally--to render you incapable of\r\n",
      "individual life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaston was immensely struck. \"They are--they are!\" he declared with\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, if you believe it, for heaven's sake go and marry her\r\n",
      "to-morrow!\" Waterlow threw down his implements and added: \"And come out\r\n",
      "of this--into the air.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaston, however, was planted in his path on the way to the door. \"And if\r\n",
      "she goes again and does the very same?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean something else as barbarous and as hard to bear.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, if she lets me in again I shall be glad they're not there! They're\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"They're right?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was unimaginable that she should.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, thank heaven! It was the finger of providence--providence taking\r\n",
      "you off your guard to give you your chance.\" This was ingenious, but,\r\n",
      "though he could glow for a moment in response to it, Francie's lover--if\r\n",
      "lover he may in his so infirm aspect be called--looked as if he\r\n",
      "mistrusted it, thought it slightly sophistical. What really shook him\r\n",
      "however was his companion's saying to him in the vestibule, when they\r\n",
      "had taken their hats and sticks and were on the point of going out:\r\n",
      "\"Lord, man, how can you be so impenetrably dense? Don't you see that\r\n",
      "she's really of the softest finest material that breathes, that she's\r\n",
      "a perfect flower of plasticity, that everything you may have an\r\n",
      "apprehension about will drop away from her like the dead leaves from a\r\n",
      "rose and that you may make of her any perfect and enchanting thing you\r\n",
      "yourself have the wit to conceive?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah my dear friend!\"--and poor Gaston, with another of his revulsions,\r\n",
      "panted for gratitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The limit will be yours, not hers,\" Waterlow added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no, I've done with limits,\" his friend ecstatically cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That evening at ten o'clock Gaston presented himself at the Hotel de\r\n",
      "l'Univers et de Cheltenham and requested the German waiter to introduce\r\n",
      "him into the dining-room attached to Mr. Dosson's apartments and then go\r\n",
      "and tell Miss Francina he awaited her there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you'll be better there than in the zalon--they've villed it with\r\n",
      "their luccatch,\" said the man, who always addressed him in an intention\r\n",
      "of English and wasn't ignorant of the tie that united the visitor to\r\n",
      "the amiable American family, or perhaps even of the modifications it had\r\n",
      "lately undergone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With their luggage?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They leave to-morrow morning--ach I don't think they themselves know\r\n",
      "for where, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Please then say to Miss Francina that I've called on the most urgent\r\n",
      "business and am extraordinarily pressed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The special ardour possessing Gaston at that moment belonged to the\r\n",
      "order of the communicative, but perhaps the vividness with which the\r\n",
      "waiter placed this exhibition of it before the young lady is better\r\n",
      "explained by the fact that her lover slipped a five-franc piece into his\r\n",
      "hand. She at any rate entered his place of patience sooner than Gaston\r\n",
      "had ventured to hope, though she corrected her promptitude a little by\r\n",
      "stopping short and drawing back when she saw how pale he was and how he\r\n",
      "looked as if he had been crying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've chosen--I've chosen,\" he said expressively, smiling at her in\r\n",
      "denial of these indications.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've chosen?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've had to give them up. But I like it so better than having to give\r\n",
      "YOU up! I took you first with their assent. That was well enough--it was\r\n",
      "worth trying for. But now I take you without it. We can live that way\r\n",
      "too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah I'm not worth it. You give up too much!\" Francie returned. \"We're\r\n",
      "going away--it's all over.\" She averted herself quickly, as if to carry\r\n",
      "out her meaning, but he caught her more quickly still and held her--held\r\n",
      "her fast and long. She had only freed herself when her father and sister\r\n",
      "broke in from the salon, attracted apparently by the audible commotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I thought you had at least knocked over the lamp!\" Delia exclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must take me with you if you're going away, Mr. Dosson,\" Gaston\r\n",
      "said. \"I'll start whenever you like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right--where shall we go?\" that amiable man asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hadn't you decided that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, the girls said they'd tell me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We were going home,\" Francie brought out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No we weren't--not a wee mite!\" Delia professed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh not THERE\" Gaston murmured, with a look of anguish at Francie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, when you've fixed it you can take the tickets,\" Mr. Dosson\r\n",
      "observed with detachment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To some place where there are no newspapers, darling,\" Gaston went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I guess you'll have hard work to find one,\" Mr. Dosson pursued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear me, we needn't read them any more. We wouldn't have read that\r\n",
      "one if your family hadn't forced us,\" Delia said to her prospective\r\n",
      "brother-in-law.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I shall never be forced--I shall never again in my life look at\r\n",
      "one,\" he very gravely declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll see, sir,--you'll have to!\" Mr. Dosson cheerfully persisted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, you'll tell us enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francie had kept her eyes on the ground; the others were all now rather\r\n",
      "unnaturally smiling. \"Won't they forgive me ever?\" she asked, looking\r\n",
      "up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, perfectly, if you can persuade me not to stick to you. But in that\r\n",
      "case what good will their forgiveness do you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, perhaps it's better to pay for it,\" the girl went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To pay for it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By suffering something. For it WAS dreadful,\" she solemnly gloomily\r\n",
      "said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh for all you'll suffer--!\" Gaston protested, shining down on her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was for you--only for you, as I told you,\" Francie returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, don't tell me again--I don't like that explanation! I ought to let\r\n",
      "you know that my father now declines to do anything for me,\" the young\r\n",
      "man added to Mr. Dosson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To do anything for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To make me any allowance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that makes me feel better. We don't want your father's money, you\r\n",
      "know,\" this more soothable parent said with his mild sturdiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There'll be enough for all; especially if we economise in\r\n",
      "newspapers\"--Delia carried it elegantly off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know, after all--the Reverberator came for nothing,\" her\r\n",
      "father as gaily returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you be afraid he'll ever send it now!\" she shouted in her return\r\n",
      "of confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm very sorry--because they were all lovely,\" Francie went on to\r\n",
      "Gaston with sad eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us wait to say that till they come back to us,\" he answered\r\n",
      "somewhat sententiously. He really cared little at this moment whether\r\n",
      "his relatives were lovely or not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure you won't have to wait long!\" Delia remarked with the same\r\n",
      "cheerfulness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Till they come back'?\" Mr. Dosson repeated. \"Ah they can't come back\r\n",
      "now, sir. We won't take them in!\" The words fell from his lips with a\r\n",
      "fine unexpected austerity which imposed itself, producing a momentary\r\n",
      "silence, and it is a sign of Gaston's complete emancipation that he\r\n",
      "didn't in his heart resent this image of eventual favours denied his\r\n",
      "race. The resentment was rather Delia's, but she kept it to herself, for\r\n",
      "she was capable of reflecting with complacency that the key of the\r\n",
      "house would after all be hers, so that she could open the door for the\r\n",
      "Proberts if the Proberts should knock. Now that her sister's marriage\r\n",
      "was really to take place her consciousness that the American people\r\n",
      "would have been resoundingly told so was still more agreeable. The\r\n",
      "party left the Hotel de l'Univers et de Cheltenham on the morrow, but it\r\n",
      "appeared to the German waiter, as he accepted another five-franc piece\r\n",

      "PREFACE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I recall with perfect ease the idea in which \"The Awkward Age\" had its\r\n",
      "origin, but re-perusal gives me pause in respect to naming it. This\r\n",
      "composition, as it stands, makes, to my vision--and will have made\r\n",
      "perhaps still more to that of its readers--so considerable a mass\r\n",
      "beside the germ sunk in it and still possibly distinguishable, that I\r\n",
      "am half-moved to leave my small secret undivulged. I shall encounter, I\r\n",
      "think, in the course of this copious commentary, no better example, and\r\n",
      "none on behalf of which I shall venture to invite more interest, of the\r\n",
      "quite incalculable tendency of a mere grain of subject-matter to expand\r\n",
      "and develop and cover the ground when conditions happen to favour it. I\r\n",
      "say all, surely, when I speak of the thing as planned, in perfect good\r\n",
      "faith, for brevity, for levity, for simplicity, for jocosity, in fine,\r\n",
      "and for an accommodating irony. I invoked, for my protection, the spirit\r\n",
      "of the lightest comedy, but \"The Awkward Age\" was to belong, in the\r\n",
      "event, to a group of productions, here re-introduced, which have in\r\n",
      "common, to their author's eyes, the endearing sign that they asserted\r\n",
      "in each case an unforeseen principle of growth. They were projected\r\n",
      "as small things, yet had finally to be provided for as comparative\r\n",
      "monsters. That is my own title for them, though I should perhaps resent\r\n",
      "it if applied by another critic--above all in the case of the piece\r\n",
      "before us, the careful measure of which I have just freshly taken. The\r\n",
      "result of this consideration has been in the first place to render sharp\r\n",
      "for me again the interest of the whole process thus illustrated, and in\r\n",
      "the second quite to place me on unexpectedly good terms with the work\r\n",
      "itself. As I scan my list I encounter none the \"history\" of which\r\n",
      "embodies a greater number of curious truths--or of truths at least by\r\n",
      "which I find contemplation more enlivened. The thing done and dismissed\r\n",
      "has ever, at the best, for the ambitious workman, a trick of looking\r\n",
      "dead, if not buried, so that he almost throbs with ecstasy when, on an\r\n",
      "anxious review, the flush of life reappears. It is verily on recognising\r\n",
      "that flush on a whole side of \"The Awkward Age\" that I brand it all,\r\n",
      "but ever so tenderly, as monstrous--which is but my way of noting the\r\n",
      "QUANTITY of finish it stows away. Since I speak so undauntedly, when\r\n",
      "need is, of the value of composition, I shall not beat about the bush to\r\n",
      "claim for these pages the maximum of that advantage. If such a feat\r\n",
      "be possible in this field as really taking a lesson from one's\r\n",
      "own adventure I feel I have now not failed of it--to so much more\r\n",
      "demonstration of my profit than I can hope to carry through do I find\r\n",
      "myself urged. Thus it is that, still with a remnant of self-respect,\r\n",
      "or at least of sanity, one may turn to complacency, one may linger with\r\n",
      "pride. Let my pride provoke a frown till I justify it; which--though\r\n",
      "with more matters to be noted here than I have room for I shall\r\n",
      "accordingly proceed to do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet I must first make a brave face, no doubt, and present in its native\r\n",
      "humility my scant but quite ponderable germ. The seed sprouted in that\r\n",
      "vast nursery of sharp appeals and concrete images which calls itself,\r\n",
      "for blest convenience, London; it fell even into the order of the minor\r\n",
      "\"social phenomena\" with which, as fruit for the observer, that mightiest\r\n",
      "of the trees of suggestion bristles. It was not, no doubt, a fine\r\n",
      "purple peach, but it might pass for a round ripe plum, the note one had\r\n",
      "inevitably had to take of the difference made in certain friendly houses\r\n",
      "and for certain flourishing mothers by the sometimes dreaded, often\r\n",
      "delayed, but never fully arrested coming to the forefront of some vague\r\n",
      "slip of a daughter. For such mild revolutions as these not, to one's\r\n",
      "imagination, to remain mild one had had, I dare say, to be infinitely\r\n",
      "addicted to \"noticing\"; under the rule of that secret vice or that\r\n",
      "unfair advantage, at any rate, the \"sitting downstairs,\" from a given\r\n",
      "date, of the merciless maiden previously perched aloft could easily be\r\n",
      "felt as a crisis. This crisis, and the sense for it in those whom it\r\n",
      "most concerns, has to confess itself courageously the prime propulsive\r\n",
      "force of \"The Awkward Age.\" Such a matter might well make a scant show\r\n",
      "for a \"thick book,\" and no thick book, but just a quite charmingly thin\r\n",
      "one, was in fact originally dreamt of. For its proposed scale the\r\n",
      "little idea seemed happy--happy, that is, above all in having come very\r\n",
      "straight; but its proposed scale was the limit of a small square canvas.\r\n",
      "One had been present again and again at the exhibition I refer to--which\r\n",
      "is what I mean by the \"coming straight\" of this particular London\r\n",

      "be a better finish of the evening than just separating in the wet? He\r\n",
      "liked his new acquaintance, who struck him as in a manner clinging to\r\n",
      "him, who was staying at an hotel presumably at that hour dismal, and\r\n",
      "who, confessing with easy humility to a connexion positively timid with\r\n",
      "a club at which one couldn't have a visitor, accepted his invitation\r\n",
      "under pressure. Vanderbank, when they arrived, was amused at the air\r\n",
      "of added extravagance with which he said he would keep the cab: he so\r\n",
      "clearly enjoyed to that extent the sense of making a night of it. \"You\r\n",
      "young men, I believe, keep them for hours, eh? At least they did in my\r\n",
      "time,\" he laughed--\"the wild ones! But I think of them as all wild then.\r\n",
      "I dare say that when one settles in town one learns how to manage; only\r\n",
      "I'm afraid, you know, that I've got completely out of it. I do feel\r\n",
      "really quite mouldy. It's a matter of thirty years--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Since you've been in London?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For more than a few days at a time, upon my honour. You won't\r\n",
      "understand that--any more, I dare say, than I myself quite understand\r\n",
      "how at the end of all I've accepted this queer view of the doom of\r\n",
      "coming back. But I don't doubt I shall ask you, if you'll be so good\r\n",
      "as to let me, for the help of a hint or two: as to how to do, don't you\r\n",
      "know? and not to--what do you fellows call it?--BE done. Now about one\r\n",
      "of THESE things--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of these things was the lift in which, at no great pace and with\r\n",
      "much rumbling and creaking, the porter conveyed the two gentlemen to\r\n",
      "the alarming eminence, as Mr. Longdon measured their flight, at which\r\n",
      "Vanderbank perched. The impression made on him by this contrivance\r\n",
      "showed him as unsophisticated, yet when his companion, at the top,\r\n",
      "ushering him in, gave a touch to the quick light and, in the pleasant\r\n",
      "ruddy room, all convenience and character, had before the fire another\r\n",
      "look at him, it was not to catch in him any protrusive angle. Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon was slight and neat, delicate of body and both keen and kind of\r\n",
      "face, with black brows finely marked and thick smooth hair in which\r\n",
      "the silver had deep shadows. He wore neither whisker nor moustache and\r\n",
      "seemed to carry in the flicker of his quick brown eyes and the positive\r\n",
      "sun-play of his smile even more than the equivalent of what might,\r\n",
      "superficially or stupidly, elsewhere be missed in him; which was mass,\r\n",
      "substance, presence--what is vulgarly called importance. He had indeed\r\n",
      "no presence but had somehow an effect. He might almost have been a\r\n",
      "priest if priests, as it occurred to Vanderbank, were ever such dandies.\r\n",
      "He had at all events conclusively doubled the Cape of the years--he\r\n",
      "would never again see fifty-five: to the warning light of that bleak\r\n",
      "headland he presented a back sufficiently conscious. Yet though\r\n",
      "to Vanderbank he couldn't look young he came near--strikingly and\r\n",
      "amusingly--looking new: this after a minute appeared mainly perhaps\r\n",
      "indeed in the perfection of his evening dress and the special smartness\r\n",
      "of the sleeveless overcoat he had evidently had made to wear with it\r\n",
      "and might even actually be wearing for the first time. He had talked to\r\n",
      "Vanderbank at Mrs. Brookenham's about Beccles and Suffolk; but it was\r\n",
      "not at Beccles nor anywhere in the county that these ornaments had been\r\n",
      "designed. His action had already been, with however little purpose,\r\n",
      "to present the region to his interlocutor in a favourable light.\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, for that matter, had the kind of imagination that likes\r\n",
      "to PLACE an object, even to the point of losing sight of it in the\r\n",
      "conditions; he already saw the nice old nook it must have taken to keep\r\n",
      "a man of intelligence so fresh while suffering him to remain so fine.\r\n",
      "The product of Beccles accepted at all events a cigarette--still much\r\n",
      "as a joke and an adventure--and looked about him as if even more pleased\r\n",
      "than he expected. Then he broke, through his double eye-glass, into an\r\n",
      "exclamation that was like a passing pang of envy and regret. \"You young\r\n",
      "men, you young men--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what about us?\" Vanderbank's tone encouraged the courtesy of the\r\n",
      "reference. \"I'm not so young moreover as that comes to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How old are you then, pray?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why I'm thirty-four.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you call that? I'm a hundred and three!\" Mr. Longdon at all\r\n",
      "events took out his watch. \"It's only a quarter past eleven.\" Then with\r\n",
      "a quick change of interest, \"What did you say is your public office?\" he\r\n",
      "enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The General Audit. I'm Deputy Chairman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear!\" Mr. Longdon looked at him as if he had had fifty windows. \"What\r\n",
      "a head you must have!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--our head's Sir Digby Dence.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what do we do for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you gild the pill--though not perhaps very thick. But it's a\r\n",
      "decent berth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A thing a good many fellows would give a pound of their flesh for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's visitor appeared so to deprecate too faint a picture that\r\n",
      "he dropped all scruples. \"I'm the most envied man I know--so that if I\r\n",
      "were a shade less amiable I should be one of the most hated.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon laughed, yet not quite as if they were joking. \"I see. Your\r\n",
      "pleasant way carries it off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank was, however, not serious. \"Wouldn't it carry off anything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again his friend, through the pince-nez, appeared to crown him with a\r\n",
      "Whitehall cornice. \"I think I ought to let you know I'm studying you.\r\n",
      "It's really fair to tell you,\" he continued with an earnestness not\r\n",
      "discomposed by the indulgence in Vanderbank's face. \"It's all right--all\r\n",
      "right!\" he reassuringly added, having meanwhile stopped before a\r\n",
      "photograph suspended on the wall. \"That's your mother!\" he brought out\r\n",
      "with something of the elation of a child making a discovery or guessing\r\n",
      "a riddle. \"I don't make you out in her yet--in my recollection of her,\r\n",
      "which, as I told you, is perfect; but I dare say I soon shall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank was more and more aware that the kind of amusement he excited\r\n",
      "would never in the least be a bar to affection. \"Please take all your\r\n",
      "time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon looked at his watch again. \"Do you think I HAD better keep\r\n",
      "it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The cab?\" Vanderbank liked him so, found in him such a promise of\r\n",
      "pleasant things, that he was almost tempted to say: \"Dear and delightful\r\n",
      "sir, don't weigh that question; I'll pay, myself, for the man's whole\r\n",
      "night!\" His approval at all events was complete.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Most certainly. That's the only way not to think of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you young men, you young men!\" his guest again murmured. He\r\n",
      "had passed on to the photograph--Vanderbank had many, too many\r\n",
      "photographs--of some other relation, and stood wiping the gold-mounted\r\n",
      "glasses through which he had been darting admirations and catching\r\n",
      "side-lights for shocks. \"Don't talk nonsense,\" he continued as his\r\n",
      "friend attempted once more to throw in a protest; \"I belong to a\r\n",
      "different period of history. There have been things this evening that\r\n",
      "have made me feel as if I had been disinterred--literally dug up from a\r\n",
      "long sleep. I assure you there have!\"--he really pressed the point.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank wondered a moment what things in particular these might be;\r\n",
      "he found himself wanting to get at everything his visitor represented,\r\n",
      "to enter into his consciousness and feel, as it were, on his side. He\r\n",
      "glanced with an intention freely sarcastic at an easy possibility. \"The\r\n",
      "extraordinary vitality of Brookenham?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, with nippers in place again, fixed on him a gravity\r\n",
      "that failed to prevent his discovering in the eyes behind them a shy\r\n",
      "reflexion of his irony. \"Oh Brookenham! You must tell me all about\r\n",
      "Brookenham.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see that's not what you mean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon forbore to deny it. \"I wonder if you'll understand what I\r\n",
      "mean.\" Vanderbank bristled with the wish to be put to the test, but was\r\n",
      "checked before he could say so. \"And what's HIS place--Brookenham's?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Rivers and Lakes--an awfully good thing. He got it last year.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon--but not too grossly--wondered. \"How did he get it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank laughed. \"Well, SHE got it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend remained grave. \"And about how much now--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh twelve hundred--and lots of allowances and boats and things. To do\r\n",
      "the work!\" Vanderbank, still with a certain levity, added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what IS the work?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man had a pause. \"Ask HIM. He'll like to tell you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yet he seemed to have but little to say.\" Mr. Longdon exactly measured\r\n",
      "it again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah not about that. Try him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked more sharply at his host, as if vaguely suspicious of a trap;\r\n",
      "then not less vaguely he sighed. \"Well, it's what I came up for--to try\r\n",
      "you all. But do they live on that?\" he continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank once more debated. \"One doesn't quite know what they live on.\r\n",
      "But they've means--for it was just that fact, I remember, that showed\r\n",
      "Brookenham's getting the place wasn't a job. It was given, I mean, not\r\n",
      "to his mere domestic need, but to his notorious efficiency. He has a\r\n",
      "property--an ugly little place in Gloucestershire--which they sometimes\r\n",
      "let. His elder brother has the better one, but they make up an income.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon for an instant lost himself. \"Yes, I remember--one heard of\r\n",
      "those things at the time. And SHE must have had something.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes indeed, she had something--and she always has her intense\r\n",
      "cleverness. She knows thoroughly how. They do it tremendously well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tremendously well,\" Mr. Longdon intelligently echoed. \"But a house in\r\n",
      "Buckingham Crescent, with the way they seem to have built through to all\r\n",
      "sorts of other places--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh they're all right,\" Vanderbank soothingly dropped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One likes to feel that of people with whom one has dined. There are\r\n",
      "four children?\" his friend went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The older boy, whom you saw and who in his way is a wonder, the older\r\n",
      "girl, whom you must see, and two youngsters, male and female, whom you\r\n",
      "mustn't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There might by this time, in the growing interest of their talk, have\r\n",
      "been almost nothing too uncanny for Mr. Longdon to fear it. \"You mean\r\n",
      "the youngsters are--unfortunate?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--they're only, like all the modern young, I think, mysteries,\r\n",
      "terrible little baffling mysteries.\" Vanderbank had found amusement\r\n",
      "again--it flickered so from his friend's face that, really at moments to\r\n",
      "the point of alarm, his explanations deepened darkness. Then with more\r\n",
      "interest he harked back. \"I know the thing you just mentioned--the thing\r\n",
      "that strikes you as odd.\" He produced his knowledge quite with elation.\r\n",
      "\"The talk.\" Mr. Longdon on this only looked at him in silence and\r\n",
      "harder, but he went on with assurance: \"Yes, the talk--for we do talk, I\r\n",
      "think.\" Still his guest left him without relief, only fixing him and his\r\n",
      "suggestion with a suspended judgement. Whatever the old man was on the\r\n",
      "point of saying, however, he disposed of in a curtailed murmur; he had\r\n",
      "already turned afresh to the series of portraits, and as he glanced at\r\n",
      "another Vanderbank spoke afresh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was very interesting to me to hear from you there, when the ladies\r\n",
      "had left us, how many old threads you were prepared to pick up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had paused. \"I'm an old boy who remembers the mothers,\" he\r\n",
      "at last replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, you told me how well you remember Mrs. Brookenham's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, oh!\"--and he arrived at a new subject. \"This must be your sister\r\n",
      "Mary.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; it's very bad, but as she's dead--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dead? Dear, dear!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh long ago\"--Vanderbank eased him off. \"It's delightful of you,\" this\r\n",
      "informant went on, \"to have known also such a lot of MY people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon turned from his contemplation with a visible effort. \"I\r\n",
      "feel obliged to you for taking it so; it mightn't--one never knows--have\r\n",
      "amused you. As I told you there, the first thing I did was to ask\r\n",
      "Fernanda about the company; and when she mentioned your name I\r\n",
      "immediately said: 'Would he like me to speak to him?'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what did Fernanda say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon stared. \"Do YOU call her Fernanda?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank felt ever so much more guilty than he would have expected.\r\n",
      "\"You think it too much in the manner we just mentioned?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend hesitated; then with a smile a trifle strange: \"Pardon me;\r\n",
      "_I_ didn't mention--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, you didn't; and your scruple was magnificent. In point of fact,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank pursued, \"I DON'T call Mrs. Brookenham by her Christian\r\n",
      "name.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's clear eyes were searching. \"Unless in speaking of her to\r\n",
      "others?\" He seemed really to wish to know.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank was but too ready to satisfy him. \"I dare say we seem to\r\n",
      "you a vulgar lot of people. That's not the way, I can see, you speak of\r\n",
      "ladies at Beccles.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh if you laugh at me--!\" And his visitor turned off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't threaten me,\" said Vanderbank, \"or I WILL send away the cab. Of\r\n",
      "course I know what you mean. It will be tremendously interesting to hear\r\n",
      "how the sort of thing we've fallen into--oh we HAVE fallen in!--strikes\r\n",
      "your fresh, your uncorrupted ear. Do have another cigarette. Sunk as I\r\n",
      "must appear to you it sometimes strikes even mine. But I'm not sure as\r\n",
      "regards Mrs. Brookenham, whom I've known a long time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon again took him up. \"What do you people call a long time?\"\r\n",

      "Vanderbank considered. \"Ah there you are! And now we're 'we people'!\r\n",
      "That's right--give it to us. I'm sure that in one way or another it's\r\n",
      "all earned. Well, I've known her ten years. But awfully well.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"We people?\" Vanderbank's enquirer, with his continued restless\r\n",

      "lightest of friendly hands. \"Don't you perhaps ask too much? But no,\"\r\n",

      "know HOW well I know Mrs. Brookenham. Mustn't that sort of thing be\r\n",
      "put in a manner to the proof? What I meant to say just now was that I\r\n",

      "an old friend.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I did, but you've your rights, and that wouldn't excuse me. The only\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon pondered and then, a little to Vanderbank's surprise, at any\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "His visitor covered him now with an attention that just operated as a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Before Vanderbank could in any degree attenuate \"What IS your Christian\r\n",
      "name?\" Mr. Longdon asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank felt of a sudden almost guilty--as if his answer could only\r\n",
      "impute extravagance to the lady. \"My Christian name\"--he blushed it\r\n",
      "out--\"is Gustavus.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, not even Gussy. But I scarcely think I ought to tell you,\"\r\n",
      "he pursued, \"if she herself gave you no glimpse of the fact. Any\r\n",
      "implication that she consciously avoided it might make you see deeper\r\n",
      "depths.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He spoke with pointed levity, but his companion showed him after an\r\n",
      "instant a face just covered--and a little painfully--with the vision of\r\n",
      "the possibility brushed away by the joke. \"Oh I'm not so bad as that!\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, she doesn't do it always,\" Vanderbank laughed, \"and it's nothing\r\n",

      "there--\" He pulled up, however, and, thinking better of it, selected\r\n",
      "another instance. \"The Duchess--weren't you introduced to the\r\n",
      "Duchess?--never calls me anything but 'Vanderbank' unless she calls me\r\n",

      "\"Yes, she's invidiously, cruelly foreign,\" Vanderbank agreed: \"I've\r\n",
      "never indeed seen a woman avail herself so cleverly, to make up for the\r\n",
      "obloquy of that state, of the benefits and immunities it brings with it.\r\n",
      "She has bloomed in the hot-house of her widowhood--she's a Neapolitan\r\n",
      "hatched by an incubator.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A Neapolitan?\"--Mr. Longdon seemed all civilly to wish he had only\r\n",
      "known it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her husband was one; but I believe that dukes at Naples are as thick\r\n",
      "as princes at Petersburg. He's dead, at any rate, poor man, and she has\r\n",
      "come back here to live.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gloomily, I should think--after Naples?\" Mr. Longdon threw out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it would take more than even a Neapolitan past--! However\"--and the\r\n",
      "young man caught himself up--\"she lives not in what's behind her, but in\r\n",
      "what's before--she lives in her precious little Aggie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Little Aggie?\" Mr. Longdon risked a cautious interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't take a liberty there,\" Vanderbank smiled: \"I speak only of the\r\n",
      "young Agnesina, a little girl, the Duchess's niece, or rather I believe\r\n",
      "her husband's, whom she has adopted--in the place of a daughter early\r\n",
      "lost--and has brought to England to marry.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah to some great man of course!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank thought. \"I don't know.\" He gave a vague but expressive sigh.\r\n",
      "\"She's rather lovely, little Aggie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon looked conspicuously subtle. \"Then perhaps YOU'RE the man!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do I look like a 'great' one?\" Vanderbank broke in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His visitor, turning away from him, again embraced the room. \"Oh dear,\r\n",
      "yes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, to show how right you are, there's the young lady.\" He\r\n",
      "pointed to an object on one of the tables, a small photograph with a\r\n",
      "very wide border of something that looked like crimson fur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon took up the picture; he was serious now. \"She's very\r\n",
      "beautiful--but she's not a little girl.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At Naples they develop early. She's only seventeen or eighteen, I\r\n",
      "suppose; but I never know how old--or at least how young--girls are, and\r\n",
      "I'm not sure. An aunt, at any rate, has of course nothing to conceal.\r\n",
      "She IS extremely pretty--with extraordinary red hair and a complexion to\r\n",
      "match; great rarities I believe, in that race and latitude. She gave me\r\n",
      "the portrait--frame and all. The frame is Neapolitan enough and little\r\n",
      "Aggie's charming.\" Then Vanderbank subjoined: \"But not so charming as\r\n",
      "little Nanda.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Little Nanda?--have you got HER?\" The old man was all eagerness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's over there beside the lamp--also a present from the original.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had gone to the place--little Nanda was in glazed white\r\n",
      "wood. He took her up and held her out; for a moment he said nothing,\r\n",
      "but presently, over his glasses, rested on his host a look intenser\r\n",
      "even than his scrutiny of the faded image. \"Do they give their portraits\r\n",
      "now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Little girls--innocent lambs? Surely--to old friends. Didn't they in\r\n",
      "your time?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon studied the portrait again; after which, with an exhalation\r\n",
      "of something between superiority and regret, \"They never did to me,\" he\r\n",
      "returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you can have all you want now!\" Vanderbank laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend gave a slow droll headshake. \"I don't want them 'now'!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You could do with them, my dear sir, still,\" Vanderbank continued in\r\n",
      "the same manner, \"every bit _I_ do!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure you do nothing you oughtn't.\" Mr. Longdon kept the photograph\r\n",
      "and continued to look at it. \"Her mother told me about her--promised me\r\n",
      "I should see her next time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must--she's a great friend of mine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon was really deep in it. \"Is she clever?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank turned it over. \"Well, you'll tell me if you think so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah with a child of seventeen--!\" Mr. Longdon murmured it as if in dread\r\n",
      "of having to pronounce. \"This one too IS seventeen?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank again considered. \"Eighteen.\" He just hung fire once\r\n",
      "more, then brought out: \"Well, call it nearly nineteen. I've kept her\r\n",
      "birthdays,\" he laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion caught at the idea. \"Upon my honour _I_ should like to!\r\n",
      "When is the next?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've plenty of time--the fifteenth of June.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm only too sorry to wait.\" Laying down the object he had been\r\n",
      "examining Mr. Longdon took another turn about the room, and his manner\r\n",
      "was such an appeal to his host to accept his restlessness that as he\r\n",
      "circulated the latter watched him with encouragement. \"I said to you\r\n",
      "just now that I knew the mothers, but it would have been more to the\r\n",
      "point to say the grandmothers.\" He stopped before his young friend,\r\n",
      "then nodded at the image of Nanda. \"I knew HERS. She put it at something\r\n",
      "less.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank rather failed to understand. \"The old lady? Put what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's face showed him as for a moment feeling his way. \"I'm\r\n",
      "speaking of Mrs. Brookenham. She spoke of her daughter as only sixteen.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's amusement at the tone of this broke out. \"She usually does!\r\n",
      "She has done so, I think, for the last year or two.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His visitor dropped upon his sofa as with the weight of something sudden\r\n",
      "and fresh; then from this place, with a sharp little movement, tossed\r\n",
      "into the fire the end of a cigarette. Vanderbank offered him another,\r\n",
      "and as he accepted it and took a light he said: \"I don't know what\r\n",
      "you're doing with me--I never at home smoke so much!\" But he puffed away\r\n",
      "and, seated near, laid his hand on Vanderbank's arm as to help himself\r\n",
      "to utter something too delicate not to be guarded and yet too important\r\n",
      "not to be risked. \"Now that's the sort of thing I did mean--as one of\r\n",
      "my impressions.\" Vanderbank continued at a loss and he went on: \"I\r\n",
      "refer--if you don't mind my saying so--to what you said just now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank was conscious of a deep desire to draw from him whatever\r\n",
      "might come; so sensible was it somehow that whatever in him was good was\r\n",
      "also thoroughly personal. But our young friend had to think a minute. \"I\r\n",
      "see, I see. Nothing's more probable than that I've said something nasty;\r\n",
      "but which of my particular horrors?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, your conveying that she makes her daughter out younger--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To make herself out the same?\" Vanderbank took him straight up. \"It was\r\n",
      "nasty my doing that? I see, I see. Yes, yes: I rather gave her away, and\r\n",
      "you're struck by it--as is most delightful you SHOULD be--because you're\r\n",
      "in every way of a better tradition and, knowing Mrs. Brookenham's my\r\n",
      "friend, can't conceive of one's playing on a friend a trick so vulgar\r\n",
      "and odious. It strikes you also probably as the kind of thing we must be\r\n",
      "constantly doing; it strikes you that right and left, probably, we keep\r\n",
      "giving each other away. Well, I dare say we do. Yes, 'come to think\r\n",
      "of it,' as they say in America, we do. But what shall I tell you?\r\n",
      "Practically we all know it and allow for it and it's as broad as it's\r\n",
      "long. What's London life after all? It's tit for tat!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but what becomes of friendship?\" Mr. Longdon earnestly and\r\n",
      "pleadingly asked, while he still held Vanderbank's arm as if under the\r\n",
      "spell of the vivid explanation supplied him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man met his eyes only the more sociably. \"Friendship?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Friendship.\" Mr. Longdon maintained the full value of the word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" his companion risked, \"I dare say it isn't in London by any\r\n",
      "means what it is at Beccles. I quite literally mean that,\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "reassuringly added; \"I never really have believed in the existence of\r\n",
      "friendship in big societies--in great towns and great crowds. It's a\r\n",
      "plant that takes time and space and air; and London society is a huge\r\n",
      "'squash,' as we elegantly call it--an elbowing pushing perspiring\r\n",
      "chattering mob.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah I don't say THAT of you!\" the visitor murmured with a withdrawal\r\n",
      "of his hand and a visible scruple for the sweeping concession he had\r\n",
      "evoked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do say it then--for God's sake; let some one say it, so that something\r\n",
      "or other, whatever it may be, may come of it! It's impossible to say too\r\n",
      "much--it's impossible to say enough. There isn't anything any one can\r\n",
      "say that I won't agree to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That shows you really don't care,\" the old man returned with acuteness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh we're past saving, if that's what you mean!\" Vanderbank laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't care, you don't care!\" his guest repeated, \"and--if I may be\r\n",
      "frank with you--I shouldn't wonder if it were rather a pity.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A pity I don't care?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You ought to, you ought to.\" And Mr. Longdon paused. \"May I say all I\r\n",
      "think?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I assure you _I_ shall! You're awfully interesting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So are you, if you come to that. It's just what I've had in my head.\r\n",
      "There's something I seem to make out in you--!\" He abruptly dropped\r\n",
      "this, however, going on in another way. \"I remember the rest of you, but\r\n",
      "why did I never see YOU?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I must have been at school--at college. Perhaps you did know my\r\n",
      "brothers, elder and younger.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There was a boy with your mother at Malvern. I was near her there for\r\n",
      "three months in--what WAS the year?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I know,\" Vanderbank replied while his guest tried to fix the date.\r\n",
      "\"It was my brother Miles. He was awfully clever, but had no health,\r\n",
      "poor chap, and we lost him at seventeen. She used to take houses at such\r\n",
      "places with him--it was supposed to be for his benefit.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon listened with a visible recovery. \"He used to talk to me--I\r\n",
      "remember he asked me questions I couldn't answer and made me dreadfully\r\n",
      "ashamed. But I lent him books--partly, upon my honour, to make him think\r\n",
      "that as I had them I did know something. He read everything and had a\r\n",
      "lot to say about it. I used to tell your mother he had a great future.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank shook his head sadly and kindly. \"So he had. And you remember\r\n",
      "Nancy, who was handsome and who was usually with them?\" he went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon looked so uncertain that he explained he meant his other\r\n",
      "sister; on which his companion said: \"Oh her? Yes, she was charming--she\r\n",
      "evidently had a future too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, she's in the midst of her future now. She's married.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And whom did she marry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A fellow called Toovey. A man in the City.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Mr. Longdon a little blankly. Then as if to retrieve his\r\n",
      "blankness: \"But why do you call her Nancy? Wasn't her name Blanche?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Exactly--Blanche Bertha Vanderbank.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon looked half-mystified and half-distressed. \"And now she's\r\n",
      "Nancy Toovey?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank broke into laughter at his dismay. \"That's what every one\r\n",
      "calls her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nobody knows. You see you were right about her future.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon gave another of his soft smothered sighs; he had turned back\r\n",
      "again to the first photograph, which he looked at for a longer time.\r\n",
      "\"Well, it wasn't HER way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My mother's? No indeed. Oh my mother's way--!\" Vanderbank waited, then\r\n",
      "added gravely: \"She was taken in time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon turned half-round as to reply to this, but instead of\r\n",
      "replying proceeded afresh to an examination of the expressive oval in\r\n",
      "the red plush frame. He took up little Aggie, who appeared to interest\r\n",
      "him, and abruptly observed: \"Nanda isn't so pretty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, not nearly. There's a great question whether Nanda's pretty at\r\n",
      "all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon continued to inspect her more favoured friend; which led him\r\n",
      "after a moment to bring out: \"She ought to be, you know. Her grandmother\r\n",
      "was.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh and her mother,\" Vanderbank threw in. \"Don't you think Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brookenham lovely?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon kept him waiting a little. \"Not so lovely as Lady Julia.\r\n",
      "Lady Julia had--!\" He faltered; then, as if there were too much to say,\r\n",
      "disposed of the question. \"Lady Julia had everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank gathered hence an impression that determined him more and\r\n",
      "more to diplomacy. \"But isn't that just what Mrs. Brookenham has?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time the old man was prompt. \"Yes, she's very brilliant, but it's\r\n",
      "a totally different thing.\" He laid little Aggie down and moved away as\r\n",
      "without a purpose; but his friend presently perceived his purpose to\r\n",
      "be another glance at the other young lady. As if all accidentally and\r\n",
      "absently he bent again over the portrait of Nanda. \"Lady Julia was\r\n",
      "exquisite and this child's exactly like her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, more and more conscious of something working in him,\r\n",
      "was more and more interested. \"If Nanda's so like her, WAS she so\r\n",
      "exquisite?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes; every one was agreed about that.\" Mr. Longdon kept his eyes on\r\n",
      "the face, trying a little, Vanderbank even thought, to conceal his own.\r\n",
      "\"She was one of the greatest beauties of her day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then IS Nanda so like her?\" Vanderbank persisted, amused at his\r\n",
      "friend's transparency.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Extraordinarily. Her mother told me all about her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Told you she's as beautiful as her grandmother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon turned it over. \"Well, that she has just Lady Julia's\r\n",
      "expression. She absolutely HAS it--I see it here.\" He was delightfully\r\n",
      "positive. \"She's much more like the dead than like the living.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank saw in this too many deep things not to follow them up.\r\n",
      "One of these was, to begin with, that his guest had not more than\r\n",
      "half-succumbed to Mrs. Brookenham's attraction, if indeed he had by\r\n",
      "a fine originality not resisted it altogether. That in itself, for\r\n",
      "an observer deeply versed in this lady, was attaching and beguiling.\r\n",
      "Another indication was that he found himself, in spite of such a break\r\n",
      "in the chain, distinctly predisposed to Nanda. \"If she reproduces then\r\n",
      "so vividly Lady Julia,\" the young man threw out, \"why does she strike\r\n",
      "you as so much less pretty than her foreign friend there, who is after\r\n",
      "all by no means a prodigy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The subject of this address, with one of the photographs in his hand,\r\n",
      "glanced, while he reflected, at the other. Then with a subtlety that\r\n",
      "matched itself for the moment with Vanderbank's: \"You just told me\r\n",
      "yourself that the little foreign person--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is ever so much the lovelier of the two? So I did. But you've promptly\r\n",
      "recognised it. It's the first time,\" Vanderbank went on, to let him\r\n",
      "down more gently, \"that I've heard Mrs. Brookenham admit the girl's good\r\n",
      "looks.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her own girl's? 'Admit' them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean grant them to be even as good as they are. I myself, I must\r\n",
      "tell you, extremely like Nanda's appearance. I think Lady Julia's\r\n",
      "granddaughter has in her face, in spite of everything--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean by everything?\" Mr. Longdon broke in with such an\r\n",
      "approach to resentment that his host's gaiety overflowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll see--when you do see. She has no features. No, not one,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank inexorably pursued; \"unless indeed you put it that she has\r\n",
      "two or three too many. What I was going to say was that she has in\r\n",
      "her expression all that's charming in her nature. But beauty, in\r\n",
      "London\"--and feeling that he held his visitor's attention he gave\r\n",
      "himself the pleasure of freely presenting his idea--\"staring glaring\r\n",
      "obvious knock-down beauty, as plain as a poster on a wall, an\r\n",
      "advertisement of soap or whiskey, something that speaks to the crowd\r\n",
      "and crosses the footlights, fetches such a price in the market that\r\n",
      "the absence of it, for a woman with a girl to marry, inspires endless\r\n",
      "terrors and constitutes for the wretched pair (to speak of mother and\r\n",
      "daughter alone) a sort of social bankruptcy. London doesn't love the\r\n",
      "latent or the lurking, has neither time nor taste nor sense for anything\r\n",
      "less discernible than the red flag in front of the steam-roller. It\r\n",
      "wants cash over the counter and letters ten feet high. Therefore you see\r\n",
      "it's all as yet rather a dark question for poor Nanda--a question that\r\n",
      "in a way quite occupies the foreground of her mother's earnest little\r\n",
      "life. How WILL she look, what will be thought of her and what will\r\n",
      "she be able to do for herself? She's at the age when the whole\r\n",
      "thing--speaking of her 'attractions,' her possible share of good\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had by this time come back to him. \"Excuse my asking\r\n",
      "it again--for you take such jumps: what, once more, do you mean by\r\n",
      "everything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why naturally her marrying. Above all her marrying early.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon stood before the sofa. \"What do you mean by early?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, we do doubtless get up later than at Beccles; but that gives\r\n",
      "us, you see, shorter days. I mean in a couple of seasons. Soon enough,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank developed, \"to limit the strain--!\" He was moved to higher\r\n",
      "gaiety by his friend's expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean by the strain?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Being where?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You do put one through!\" Vanderbank laughed. But he showed himself\r\n",
      "perfectly prepared. \"Out of the school-room and where she is now. In her\r\n",
      "mother's drawing-room. At her mother's fireside.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon stared. \"But where else should she be?\"\r\n",

      "\"At her husband's, don't you see?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked as if he quite saw, yet was nevertheless not to be put off\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon slightly attenuated this way of putting it. \"Yes--and in the\r\n",

      "of it?\"\r\n",

      "III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank at this left his corner of the sofa and, with his hands\r\n",
      "in his pockets and a manner so amused that it might have passed for\r\n",
      "excited, took several paces about the room while his interlocutor,\r\n",
      "watching him, waited for his response. That gentleman, as this response\r\n",
      "for a minute hung fire, took his turn at sitting down, and then\r\n",
      "Vanderbank stopped before him with a face in which something had been\r\n",
      "still more brightly kindled. \"You ask me more things than I can tell\r\n",
      "you. You ask me more than I think you suspect. You must come and see me\r\n",
      "again--you must let me come and see you. You raise the most interesting\r\n",
      "questions and we must sooner or later have them all out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon looked happy in such a prospect, but once more took out his\r\n",
      "watch. \"It wants five minutes to midnight. Which means that I must go\r\n",
      "now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not in the least. There are satisfactions you too must give.\" His host,\r\n",
      "with an irresistible hand, confirmed him in his position and pressed\r\n",
      "upon him another cigarette. His resistance rang hollow--it was clearly,\r\n",
      "he judged, such an occasion for sacrifices. Vanderbank's view of it\r\n",
      "meanwhile was quite as marked. \"You see there's ever so much more you\r\n",
      "must in common kindness tell me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon sat there like a shy singer invited to strike up. \"I told\r\n",
      "you everything at Mrs. Brookenham's. It comes over me now how I dropped\r\n",
      "on you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What you told me,\" Vanderbank returned, \"was excellent so far as it\r\n",
      "went; but it was only after all that, having caught my name, you had\r\n",
      "asked of our friend if I belonged to people you had known years before,\r\n",
      "and then, from what she had said, had--with what you were so good as to\r\n",
      "call great pleasure--made out that I did. You came round to me on this,\r\n",
      "after dinner, and gave me a pleasure still greater. But that only takes\r\n",
      "us part of the way.\" Mr. Longdon said nothing, but there was something\r\n",
      "appreciative in his conscious lapses; they were a tribute to his young\r\n",
      "friend's frequent felicity. This personage indeed appeared more and more\r\n",
      "to take them for that--which was not without its effect on his spirits.\r\n",
      "At last, with a flight of some freedom, he brought their pause to a\r\n",
      "close. \"You loved Lady Julia.\" Then as the attitude of his guest, who\r\n",
      "serenely met his eyes, was practically a contribution to the subject,\r\n",
      "he went on with a feeling that he had positively pleased. \"You lost\r\n",
      "her--and you're unmarried.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's smile was beautiful--it supplied so many meanings that\r\n",
      "when presently he spoke he seemed already to have told half his story.\r\n",
      "\"Well, my life took a form. It had to, or I don't know what would have\r\n",
      "become of me, and several things that all happened at once helped me\r\n",
      "out. My father died--I came into the little place in Suffolk. My sister,\r\n",
      "my only one, who had married and was older than I, lost within a year or\r\n",
      "two both her husband and her little boy. I offered her, in the country,\r\n",
      "a home, for her trouble was greater than any trouble of mine. She came,\r\n",
      "she stayed; it went on and on and we lived there together. We were sorry\r\n",
      "for each other and it somehow suited us. But she died two years ago.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank took all this in, only wishing to show--wishing by this time\r\n",
      "quite tenderly--that he even read into it deeply enough all the unsaid.\r\n",
      "He filled out another of his friend's gaps. \"And here you are.\" Then he\r\n",
      "invited Mr. Longdon himself to make the stride. \"Well, you'll be a great\r\n",
      "success.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, that we shall be so infatuated with you that we shall make your\r\n",
      "life a burden to you. You'll see soon enough what I mean by it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Possibly,\" the old man said; \"to understand you I shall have to. You\r\n",
      "speak of something that as yet--with my race practically run--I know\r\n",
      "nothing about. I was no success as a young man. I mean of the sort that\r\n",
      "would have made most difference. People wouldn't look at me--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, WE shall look at you,\" Vanderbank declared. Then he added: \"What\r\n",
      "people do you mean?\" And before his friend could reply: \"Lady Julia?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's assent was mute. \"Ah she was not the worst! I mean that\r\n",
      "what made it so bad,\" he continued, \"was that they all really liked\r\n",
      "me. Your mother, I think--as to THAT, the dreadful consolatory\r\n",
      "'liking'--even more than the others.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My mother?\"--Vanderbank was surprised. \"You mean there was a\r\n",
      "question--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh for but half a minute! It didn't take her long. It was five years\r\n",
      "after your father's death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This explanation was very delicately made. \"She COULD marry again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I suppose you know she did,\" Vanderbank returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I knew it soon enough!\" With this, abruptly, Mr. Longdon pulled himself\r\n",
      "forward. \"Good-night, good-night.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-night,\" said Vanderbank. \"But wasn't that AFTER Lady Julia?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the edge of the sofa, his hands supporting him, Mr. Longdon looked\r\n",
      "straight. \"There was nothing after Lady Julia.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see.\" His companion smiled. \"My mother was earlier.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She was extremely good to me. I'm not speaking of that time at\r\n",
      "Malvern--that came later.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Precisely--I understand. You're speaking of the first years of her\r\n",
      "widowhood.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon just faltered. \"I should call them rather the last. Six\r\n",
      "months later came her second marriage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's interest visibly improved. \"Ah it was THEN? That was about\r\n",
      "my seventh year.\" He called things back and pieced them together. \"But\r\n",
      "she must have been older than you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--a little. She was kindness itself to me at all events, then and\r\n",
      "afterwards. That was the charm of the weeks at Malvern.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see,\" the young man laughed. \"The charm was that you had recovered.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear, no!\" Mr. Longdon, rather to his mystification, exclaimed. \"I'm\r\n",
      "afraid I hadn't recovered at all--hadn't, if that's what you mean, got\r\n",
      "over my misery and my melancholy. She knew I hadn't--and that was what\r\n",
      "was nice of her. She was a person with whom I could talk about her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank took a moment to clear up the ambiguity. \"Oh you mean you\r\n",
      "could talk about the OTHER. You hadn't got over Lady Julia.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon sadly smiled at him. \"I haven't got over her yet!\" Then,\r\n",
      "however, as if not to look morbid, he took pains to be clear. \"The first\r\n",
      "wound was bad--but from that one always comes round. Your mother,\r\n",
      "dear woman, had known how to help me. Lady Julia was at that time her\r\n",
      "intimate friend--it was she who introduced me there. She couldn't help\r\n",
      "what happened--she did her best. What I meant just now was that in the\r\n",
      "aftertime, when opportunity occurred, she was the one person with whom I\r\n",
      "could always talk and who always understood.\" He lost himself an instant\r\n",
      "in the deep memories to attest which he had survived alone; then he\r\n",
      "sighed out as if the taste of it all came back to him with a faint\r\n",
      "sweetness: \"I think they must both have been good to me. At the Malvern\r\n",
      "time, the particular time I just mentioned to you, Lady Julia was\r\n",
      "already married, and during those first years she had been whirled out\r\n",
      "of my ken. Then her own life took a quieter turn; we met again; I went\r\n",
      "for a good while often to her house. I think she rather liked the state\r\n",
      "to which she had reduced me, though she didn't, you know, in the least\r\n",
      "presume on it. The better a woman is--it has often struck me--the more\r\n",
      "she enjoys in a quiet way some fellow's having been rather bad, rather\r\n",
      "dark and desperate, about her--for her. I dare say, I mean, that though\r\n",
      "Lady Julia insisted I ought to marry she wouldn't really have liked it\r\n",
      "much if I had. At any rate it was in those years I saw her daughter just\r\n",
      "cease to be a child--the little girl who was to be transformed by time\r\n",
      "into the so different person with whom we dined to-night. That comes\r\n",
      "back to me when I hear you speak of the growing up, in turn, of that\r\n",
      "person's own daughter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I follow you with a sympathy--!\" Vanderbank replied. \"The situation's\r\n",
      "reproduced.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah partly--not altogether. The things that are unlike--well, are so\r\n",
      "VERY unlike.\" Mr. Longdon for a moment, on this, fixed his companion\r\n",
      "with eyes that betrayed one of the restless little jumps of his mind. \"I\r\n",
      "told you just now that there's something I seem to make out in you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, that was meant for better things?\"--Vanderbank frankly took him\r\n",
      "up. \"There IS something, I really believe--meant for ever so much better\r\n",
      "ones. Those are just the sort I like to be supposed to have a real\r\n",
      "affinity with. Help me to them, Mr. Longdon; help me to them, and I\r\n",
      "don't know what I won't do for you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then after all\"--and his friend made the point with innocent\r\n",
      "sharpness--\"you're NOT past saving!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I individually--how shall I put it to you? If I tell you,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank went on, \"that I've that sort of fulcrum for salvation which\r\n",
      "consists at least in a deep consciousness and the absence of a rag of\r\n",
      "illusion, I shall appear to say I'm wholly different from the world I\r\n",
      "live in and to that extent present myself as superior and fatuous. Try\r\n",
      "me at any rate. Let me try myself. Don't abandon me. See what can be\r\n",
      "done with me. Perhaps I'm after all a case. I shall certainly cling to\r\n",
      "you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're too clever--you're too clever: that's what's the matter with you\r\n",
      "all!\" Mr. Longdon sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With us ALL?\" Vanderbank echoed. \"Dear Mr. Longdon, it's the first time\r\n",
      "I've heard it. If you should say the matter with ME in particular, why\r\n",
      "there might be something in it. What you mean at any rate--I see where\r\n",
      "you come out--is that we're cold and sarcastic and cynical, without the\r\n",
      "soft human spot. I think you flatter us even while you attempt to warn;\r\n",
      "but what's extremely interesting at all events is that, as I gather,\r\n",
      "we made on you this evening, in a particular way, a collective\r\n",
      "impression--something in which our trifling varieties are merged.\" His\r\n",
      "visitor's face, at this, appeared to acknowledge his putting the case\r\n",
      "in perfection, so that he was encouraged to go on. \"There was something\r\n",
      "particular with which you weren't altogether pleasantly struck.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, who decidedly changed colour easily, showed in his clear\r\n",
      "cheek the effect at once of feeling a finger on his fault and of\r\n",
      "admiring his companion's insight. But he accepted the situation. \"I\r\n",
      "couldn't help noticing your tone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean its being so low?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had smiled at first but looked grave now. \"Do you really want to\r\n",
      "know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just how you were affected? I assure you there's at this moment nothing\r\n",
      "I desire nearly so much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm no judge then,\" Mr. Longdon began; \"I'm no critic; I'm no talker\r\n",
      "myself. I'm old-fashioned and narrow and ignorant. I've lived for years\r\n",
      "in a hole. I'm not a man of the world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank considered him with a benevolence, a geniality of approval,\r\n",
      "that he literally had to hold in check for fear of seeming to patronise.\r\n",
      "\"There's not one of us who can touch you. You're delightful, you're\r\n",
      "wonderful, and I'm intensely curious to hear you,\" the young man\r\n",
      "pursued. \"Were we absolutely odious?\" Before his guest's puzzled,\r\n",
      "finally almost pained face, such an air of appreciating so much candour,\r\n",
      "yet of looking askance at so much freedom, he could only try to smooth\r\n",
      "the way and light the subject. \"You see we don't in the least know where\r\n",
      "we are. We're lost--and you find us.\" Mr. Longdon, as he spoke, had\r\n",
      "prepared at last really to go, reaching the door with a manner that\r\n",
      "denoted, however, by no means so much satiety as an attention that felt\r\n",
      "itself positively too agitated. Vanderbank had helped him on with the\r\n",
      "Inverness cape and for an instant detained him by it. \"Just tell me as a\r\n",
      "kindness. DO we talk--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Too freely?\" Mr. Longdon, with his clear eyes so untouched by time,\r\n",
      "speculatively murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Too outrageously. I want the truth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The truth evidently for Mr. Longdon was difficult to tell. \"Well--it was\r\n",
      "certainly different.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From you and Lady Julia? I see. Well, of course with time SOME change\r\n",
      "is natural, isn't it? But so different,\" Vanderbank pressed, \"that you\r\n",
      "were really shocked?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His visitor smiled at this, but the smile somehow made the face graver.\r\n",

      "Mrs. Brookenham stopped on the threshold with the sharp surprise of the\r\n",
      "sight of her son, and there was disappointment, though rather of the\r\n",

      "Deep in a large brocaded chair with his little legs stuck out to the\r\n",

      "She had evidently roused him from sleep, and it took him a couple\r\n",
      "of minutes--during which, without again looking at him, she directly\r\n",

      "possession. Her air on observing them had promptly become that of having\r\n",
      "been in search of them, and a moment after she had passed across the\r\n",

      "silence for the present mark of her relation with Harold, yet she soon\r\n",
      "failed to resist a sufficiently poor reason for breaking it. \"Be so good\r\n",

      "hearth-rug, on which, with his hands behind him, he lingered a while.\r\n",
      "He was small and had a slight stoop which somehow gave him\r\n",
      "character--character of the insidious sort carried out in the acuteness,\r\n",
      "difficult to trace to a source, of his smooth fair face, where the lines\r\n",
      "were all curves and the expression all needles. He had the voice of a\r\n",
      "man of forty and was dressed--as if markedly not for London--with an\r\n",
      "air of experience that seemed to match it. He pulled down his waistcoat,\r\n",
      "smoothing himself, feeling his neat hair and looking at his shoes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I took your five pounds. Also two of the sovereigns,\" he went on. \"I\r\n",
      "left you two pound ten.\" His mother jerked up her head at this,\r\n",
      "facing him in dismay, and, immediately on her feet, passed back to the\r\n",

      "the truth. I thought I should find something--I had noticed; and I do\r\n",

      "description of her was by looking beautifully desperate. She had about\r\n",
      "her the pure light of youth--would always have it; her head, her figure,\r\n",
      "her flexibility, her flickering colour, her lovely silly eyes, her\r\n",
      "natural quavering tone, all played together toward this effect by\r\n",
      "some trick that had never yet been exposed. It was at the same time\r\n",
      "remarkable that--at least in the bosom of her family--she rarely wore\r\n",
      "an appearance of gaiety less qualified than at the present juncture;\r\n",
      "she suggested for the most part the luxury, the novelty of woe, the\r\n",
      "excitement of strange sorrows and the cultivation of fine indifferences.\r\n",
      "This was her special sign--an innocence dimly tragic. It gave immense\r\n",
      "effect to her other resources. She opened the secretary with the key\r\n",
      "she had quickly found, then with the aid of another rattled out a small\r\n",
      "drawer; after which she pushed the drawer back, closing the whole thing.\r\n",

      "think--that it will be all right for me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "ENOUGH, mummy dear? At any rate it's as plain as possible that if you\r\n",
      "don't keep us at home you must keep us in other places. One can't live\r\n",
      "anywhere for nothing--it's all bosh that a fellow saves by staying with\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham had opened her eyes, but she still attached them to the\r\n",

      "In a great house like that there's always room.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man watched her a moment. \"How you DO like to tuck us in and\r\n",

      "to, mummy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She rose at this, turning her eyes about the room as if from the\r\n",
      "extremity of martyrdom or the wistfulness of some deep thought. Yet when\r\n",
      "she spoke it was with a different expression, an expression that\r\n",
      "would have served for an observer as a marked illustration of that\r\n",
      "disconnectedness of her parts which frequently was laughable even to the\r\n",
      "degree of contributing to her social success. \"You've spent then more\r\n",
      "than four pounds in five days. It was on Friday I gave them to you. What\r\n",
      "in the world do you suppose is going to become of me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Anything to assist you. Only, if I SHOULD find I'm not wanted--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She met his look after an instant, and the wan loveliness and vagueness\r\n",
      "of her own had never been greater. \"BE wanted, and you won't find it.\r\n",
      "You're odious, but you're not a fool.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put his arms about her now for farewell, and she submitted as if it\r\n",
      "was absolutely indifferent to her to whose bosom she was pressed. \"You\r\n",
      "do, dearest,\" he laughed, \"say such sweet things!\" And with that he\r\n",
      "reached the door, on opening which he pulled up at a sound from below.\r\n",
      "\"The Duchess! She's coming up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham looked quickly round the room, but she spoke with utter\r\n",
      "detachment. \"Well, let her come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As I'd let her go. I take it as a happy sign SHE won't be at Brander.\"\r\n",
      "He stood with his hand on the knob; he had another quick appeal. \"But\r\n",
      "after Tuesday?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham had passed half round the room with the glide that\r\n",
      "looked languid but that was really a remarkable form of activity, and\r\n",
      "had given a transforming touch, on sofa and chairs, to three or four\r\n",
      "crushed cushions. It was all with the hanging head of a broken lily.\r\n",
      "\"You're to stay till the twelfth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But if I AM kicked out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was as a broken lily that she considered it. \"Then go to the\r\n",
      "Mangers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Happy thought! And shall I write?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His mother raised a little more a window-blind. \"No--I will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Delicious mummy!\" And Harold blew her a kiss.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, rather\"--she corrected herself. \"Do write--from Brander. It's the\r\n",
      "sort of thing for the Mangers. Or even wire.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Both?\" the young man laughed. \"Oh you duck!\" he cried. \"And from where\r\n",
      "will YOU let them have it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From Pewbury,\" she replied without wincing. \"I'll write on Sunday.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good. How d'ye do, Duchess?\"--and Harold, before he disappeared,\r\n",
      "greeted with a rapid concentration of all the shades of familiarity a\r\n",
      "large high lady, the visitor he had announced, who rose in the doorway\r\n",
      "with the manner of a person used to arriving on thresholds very much as\r\n",
      "people arrive at stations--with the expectation of being \"met.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye. He's off,\" Mrs. Brookenham, who had remained quite on her own\r\n",
      "side of the room, explained to her friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where's he off to?\" this friend enquired with a casual advance and a\r\n",
      "look not so much at her hostess as at the cushions just rearranged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh to some places. To Brander to-day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How he does run about!\" And the Duchess, still with a glance hither\r\n",
      "and yon, sank upon the sofa to which she had made her way unaided. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brookenham knew perfectly the meaning of this glance: she had but three\r\n",
      "or four comparatively good pieces, whereas the Duchess, rich with the\r\n",
      "spoils of Italy, had but three or four comparatively bad. This was\r\n",
      "the relation, as between intimate friends, that the Duchess visibly\r\n",
      "preferred, and it was quite groundless, in Buckingham Crescent, ever to\r\n",
      "enter the drawing-room with an expression suspicious of disloyalty. The\r\n",
      "Duchess was a woman who so cultivated her passions that she would have\r\n",
      "regarded it as disloyal to introduce there a new piece of furniture in\r\n",
      "an underhand way--that is without a full appeal to herself, the highest\r\n",
      "authority, and the consequent bestowal of opportunity to nip the mistake\r\n",
      "in the bud. Mrs. Brookenham had repeatedly asked herself where in the\r\n",
      "world she might have found the money to be disloyal. The Duchess's\r\n",
      "standard was of a height--! It matched for that matter her other\r\n",
      "elements, which were wontedly conspicuous as usual as she sat there\r\n",
      "suggestive of early tea. She always suggested tea before the hour, and\r\n",
      "her friend always, but with so different a wistfulness, rang for it.\r\n",
      "\"Who's to be at Brander?\" she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I haven't the least idea--he didn't tell me. But they've always a lot\r\n",
      "of people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know--extraordinary mixtures. Has he been there before?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham thought. \"Oh yes--if I remember--more than once. In\r\n",
      "fact her note--which he showed me, but which only mentioned 'some\r\n",
      "friends'--was a sort of appeal on the ground of something or other that\r\n",
      "had happened the last time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess dealt with it. \"She writes the most extraordinary notes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, this was nice, I thought,\" Mrs. Brookenham said--\"from a woman of\r\n",
      "her age and her immense position to so young a man.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the Duchess reflected. \"My dear, she's not an American and she's\r\n",
      "not on the stage. Aren't those what you call positions in this country?\r\n",
      "And she's also not a hundred.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but Harold's a mere baby.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then he doesn't seem to want for nurses!\" the Duchess replied. She\r\n",
      "smiled at her hostess. \"Your children are like their mother--they're\r\n",
      "eternally young.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'M not a hundred!\" moaned Mrs. Brookenham as if she wished with\r\n",
      "dim perversity she were.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Every one's at any rate awfully kind to Harold.\" She waited a moment to\r\n",
      "give her visitor the chance to pronounce that eminently natural, but no\r\n",
      "pronouncement came--nothing but the footman who had answered her ring\r\n",
      "and of whom she ordered tea. \"And where did you say YOU'RE going?\" she\r\n",
      "enquired after this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For Easter?\" The Duchess achieved a direct encounter with her charming\r\n",
      "eyes--which was not in general an easy feat. \"I didn't say I was going\r\n",
      "anywhere. I haven't of a sudden changed my habits. You know whether I\r\n",
      "leave my child--except in the sense of having left her an hour ago at\r\n",
      "Mr. Garlick's class in Modern Light Literature. I confess I'm a little\r\n",
      "nervous about the subjects and am going for her at five.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And then where do you take her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Home to her tea. Where should you think?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham declined, in connexion with the matter, any\r\n",
      "responsibility of thought; she did indeed much better by saying after a\r\n",
      "moment: \"You ARE devoted!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss Merriman has her afternoon--I can't imagine what they do with\r\n",
      "their afternoons,\" the Duchess went on. \"But she's to be back in the\r\n",
      "school-room at seven.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you have Aggie till then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Till then,\" said the Duchess cheerfully. \"You're off for Easter\r\n",
      "to--where is it?\" she continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham had received with no flush of betrayal the various\r\n",
      "discriminations thus conveyed by her visitor, and her only revenge for\r\n",
      "the moment was to look as sweetly resigned as if she really saw what was\r\n",
      "in them. Where were they going for Easter? She had to think an instant,\r\n",
      "but she brought it out. \"Oh to Pewbury--we've been engaged so long that\r\n",
      "I had forgotten. We go once a year--one does it for Edward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you spoil him!\" smiled the Duchess. \"Who's to be there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh the usual thing, I suppose. A lot of my lord's tiresome supporters.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To pay his debt? Then why are you poor things asked?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham looked, on this, quite adorably--that is most\r\n",
      "wonderingly--grave. \"How do I know, my dear Jane, why in the world we're\r\n",
      "ever asked anywhere? Fancy people wanting Edward!\" she exhaled with\r\n",
      "stupefaction. \"Yet we can never get off Pewbury.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're better for getting on, cara mia, than for getting off!\" the\r\n",
      "Duchess blandly returned. She was a person of no small presence, filling\r\n",
      "her place, however, without ponderosity, with a massiveness indeed\r\n",
      "rather artfully kept in bounds. Her head, her chin, her shoulders were\r\n",
      "well aloft, but she had not abandoned the cultivation of a \"figure\" or\r\n",
      "any of the distinctively finer reasons for passing as a handsome woman.\r\n",
      "She was secretly at war moreover, in this endeavour, with a lurking no\r\n",
      "less than with a public foe, and thoroughly aware that if she didn't\r\n",
      "look well she might at times only, and quite dreadfully, look good.\r\n",
      "There were definite ways of escape, none of which she neglected and from\r\n",
      "the total of which, as she flattered herself, the air of distinction\r\n",
      "almost mathematically resulted. This air corresponded superficially with\r\n",
      "her acquired Calabrian sonorities, from her voluminous title down, but\r\n",
      "the colourless hair, the passionless forehead, the mild cheek and\r\n",
      "long lip of the British matron, the type that had set its trap for her\r\n",
      "earlier than any other, were elements difficult to deal with and were\r\n",
      "at moments all a sharp observer saw. The battle-ground then was the\r\n",
      "haunting danger of the bourgeois. She gave Mrs. Brookenham no time to\r\n",
      "resent her last note before enquiring if Nanda were to accompany the\r\n",
      "couple.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mercy mercy, no--she's not asked.\" Mrs. Brookenham, on Nanda's behalf,\r\n",
      "fairly radiated obscurity. \"My children don't go where they're not\r\n",
      "asked.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I never said they did, love,\" the Duchess returned. \"But what then do\r\n",
      "you do with her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you mean socially\"--Mrs. Brookenham looked as if there might be\r\n",
      "in some distant sphere, for which she almost yearned, a maternal\r\n",
      "opportunity very different from that--\"if you mean socially, I don't do\r\n",
      "anything at all. I've never pretended to do anything. You know as well\r\n",
      "as I do, dear Jane, that I haven't begun yet.\" Jane's hostess now spoke\r\n",
      "as simply as an earnest anxious child. She gave a vague patient sigh. \"I\r\n",
      "suppose I must begin!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess remained for a little rather grimly silent. \"How old is\r\n",
      "she--twenty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thirty!\" said Mrs. Brookenham with distilled sweetness. Then with no\r\n",
      "transition of tone: \"She has gone for a few days to Tishy Grendon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the country?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She stays with her to-night in Hill Street. They go down together\r\n",
      "to-morrow. Why hasn't Aggie been?\" Mrs. Brookenham went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess handsomely stared. \"Been where?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why here, to see Nanda.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here?\" the Duchess echoed, fairly looking again about the room. \"When\r\n",
      "is Nanda ever here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you know I've given her a room of her own--the sweetest little room\r\n",
      "in the world.\" Mrs. Brookenham never looked so comparatively hopeful as\r\n",
      "when obliged to explain. \"She has everything there a girl can want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear woman,\" asked the Duchess, \"has she sometimes her own mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The men had now come in to place the tea-table, and it was the movements\r\n",
      "of the red-haired footman that Mrs. Brookenham followed. \"You had better\r\n",
      "ask my child herself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess was frank and jovial. \"I would, I promise you, if I could\r\n",
      "get at her! But isn't that woman always with her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham smoothed the little embroidered tea-cloth. \"Do you call\r\n",
      "Tishy Grendon a woman?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the Duchess had one of her pauses, which were indeed so frequent\r\n",
      "in her talks with this intimate that an auditor could sometimes wonder\r\n",
      "what particular form of relief they represented. They might have been a\r\n",
      "habit proceeding from the fear of undue impatience. If the Duchess had\r\n",
      "been as impatient with Mrs. Brookenham as she would possibly have seemed\r\n",
      "without them her frequent visits in the face of irritation would have\r\n",
      "had to be accounted for. \"What do YOU call her?\" she demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why Nanda's best friend--if not her only one. That's the place I SHOULD\r\n",
      "have liked for Aggie,\" Mrs. Brookenham ever so graciously smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess hereupon, going beyond her, gave way to free mirth. \"My\r\n",
      "dear thing, you're delightful. Aggie OR Tishy is a sweet thought. Since\r\n",
      "you're so good as to ask why Aggie has fallen off you'll excuse my\r\n",
      "telling you that you've just named the reason. You've known ever since\r\n",
      "we came to England what I feel about the proper persons--and the most\r\n",
      "improper--for her to meet. The Tishy Grendons are not a bit the proper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham continued to assist a little in the preparations for\r\n",
      "tea. \"Why not say at once, Jane\"--and her tone, in its appeal, was\r\n",
      "almost infantine--\"that you've come at last to placing even poor Nanda,\r\n",
      "for Aggie's wonderful purpose, in the same impossible class?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess took her time, but at last she accepted her duty. \"Well, if\r\n",
      "you will have it. You know my ideas. If it isn't my notion of the way to\r\n",
      "bring up a girl to give her up, in extreme youth, to an intimacy with a\r\n",
      "young married woman who's both unhappy and silly, whose conversation has\r\n",
      "absolutely no limits, who says everything that comes into her head and\r\n",
      "talks to the poor child about God only knows what--if I should never\r\n",
      "dream of such an arrangement for my niece I can almost as little face\r\n",
      "the prospect of throwing her MUCH, don't you see? with any young\r\n",
      "person exposed to such an association. It would be in the natural order\r\n",
      "certainly\"--in spite of which natural order the Duchess made the point\r\n",
      "with but moderate emphasis--\"that, since dear Edward is my cousin, Aggie\r\n",
      "should see at least as much of Nanda as of any other girl of their age.\r\n",
      "But what will you have? I must recognise the predicament I'm placed in\r\n",
      "by the more and more extraordinary development of English manners.\r\n",
      "Many things have altered, goodness knows, since I was Aggie's age, but\r\n",
      "nothing's so different as what you all do with your girls. It's all a\r\n",
      "muddle, a compromise, a monstrosity, like everything else you produce;\r\n",
      "there's nothing in it that goes on all-fours. _I_ see but one consistent\r\n",
      "way, which is our fine old foreign way and which makes--in the upper\r\n",
      "classes, mind you, for it's with them only I'm concerned--des femmes\r\n",
      "bien gracieuses. I allude to the immemorial custom of my husband's\r\n",
      "race, which was good enough for his mother and his mother's mother, for\r\n",
      "Aggie's own, for his other sisters, for toutes ces dames. It would have\r\n",
      "been good enough for my child, as I call her--my dear husband called her\r\n",
      "HIS--if, not losing her parents, she had remained in her own country.\r\n",
      "She would have been brought up there under an anxious eye--that's the\r\n",
      "great point; privately, carefully, tenderly, and with what she was NOT\r\n",
      "to learn--till the proper time--looked after quite as much as the\r\n",
      "rest. I can only go on with her in that spirit and make of her, under\r\n",
      "Providence, what I consider any young person of her condition, of her\r\n",
      "name, of her particular traditions, should be. Voila, ma chere. Should\r\n",
      "you put it to me whether I think you're surrounding Nanda with any such\r\n",
      "security as that--well, I shouldn't be able to help it if I offended you\r\n",
      "by an honest answer. What it comes to, simply stated, is that really she\r\n",
      "must choose between Aggie and Tishy. I'm afraid I should shock you were\r\n",
      "I to tell you what I should think of myself for packing MY child, all\r\n",
      "alone, off for a week with Mrs. Grendon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham, who had many talents, had none perhaps that she oftener\r\n",
      "found useful than that of listening with the appearance of being fairly\r\n",
      "hypnotised. It was the way she listened to her housekeeper at their\r\n",
      "regular morning conference, and if the rejoinder ensuing upon it\r\n",
      "frequently appeared to have nothing to do with her manner this was a\r\n",
      "puzzle for her interlocutor alone. \"Oh of course I know your theory,\r\n",
      "dear Jane, and I dare say it's very charming and old-fashioned and, if\r\n",
      "you like, aristocratic, in a frowsy foolish old way--though even upon\r\n",
      "that, at the same time, there would be something too to be said. But I\r\n",
      "can only congratulate you on finding it more workable than there can be\r\n",
      "any question of MY finding it. If you're all armed for the sacrifices\r\n",
      "you speak of I simply am not. I don't think I'm quite a monster, but\r\n",
      "I don't pretend to be a saint. I'm an English wife and an English\r\n",
      "mother--I live in the mixed English world. My daughter, at any rate,\r\n",
      "is just my daughter, I thank my stars, and one of a good English bunch:\r\n",
      "she's not the unique niece of my dead Italian husband, nor doubtless\r\n",
      "either, in spite of her excellent birth, of a lineage, like Aggie's, so\r\n",
      "very tremendous. I've my life to lead and she's a part of it. Sugar?\"\r\n",
      "she wound up on a still softer note as she handed the cup of tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never! Well, with ME\" said the Duchess with spirit, \"she would be all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'All' is soon said! Life is composed of many things,\" Mrs. Brookenham\r\n",
      "gently rang out--\"of such mingled intertwisted strands!\" Then still with\r\n",
      "the silver bell, \"Don't you really think Tishy nice?\" she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think little girls should live with little girls and young femmes du\r\n",

      "toss of her head, \"let them alone. What do they want of them 'at all at\r\n",
      "all'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, my dear, if Tishy strikes you as 'initiated' all one can ask is\r\n",
      "'Initiated into what?' I should as soon think of applying such a term\r\n",
      "to a little shivering shorn lamb. Is it your theory,\" Mrs. Brookenham\r\n",
      "pursued, \"that our unfortunate unmarried daughters are to have no\r\n",
      "intelligent friends?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Unfortunate indeed,\" cried the Duchess, \"precisely BECAUSE they're\r\n",
      "unmarried, and unmarried, if you don't mind my saying so, a good deal\r\n",
      "because they're unmarriageable. Men, after all, the nice ones--by which\r\n",
      "I mean the possible ones--are not on the lookout for little brides whose\r\n",
      "usual associates are so up to snuff. It's not their idea that the girls\r\n",
      "they marry shall already have been pitchforked--by talk and contacts and\r\n",
      "visits and newspapers and by the way the poor creatures rush about and\r\n",
      "all the extraordinary things they do--quite into EVERYTHING. A girl's\r\n",
      "most intelligent friend is her mother--or the relative acting as such.\r\n",
      "Perhaps you consider that Tishy takes your place!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham waited so long to say what she considered that before\r\n",
      "she next spoke the question appeared to have dropped. Then she\r\n",
      "only replied as if suddenly remembering her manners: \"Won't you eat\r\n",
      "something?\" She indicated a particular plate. \"One of the nice little\r\n",
      "round ones?\" The Duchess appropriated a nice little round one and her\r\n",
      "hostess presently went on: \"There's one thing I mustn't forget--don't\r\n",
      "let us eat them ALL. I believe they're what Lord Petherton really comes\r\n",
      "for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess finished her mouthful imperturbably before she took this up.\r\n",
      "\"Does he come so often?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham might have been, for judicious candour, the Muse of\r\n",
      "History. \"I don't know what he calls it; but he said yesterday that he'd\r\n",
      "come today. I've had tea earlier for you,\" she went on with her most\r\n",
      "melancholy kindness--\"and he's always late. But we mustn't, between us,\r\n",
      "lick the platter clean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess entered very sufficiently into her companion's tone. \"Oh\r\n",
      "I don't feel at all obliged to consider him, for he has not of late\r\n",
      "particularly put himself out for me. He has not been to see me since I\r\n",
      "don't know when, and the last time he did come he brought Mr. Mitchett.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here it was the other way round. It was Mr. Mitchett, the other year,\r\n",
      "who first brought Lord Petherton.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And who,\" asked the Duchess, \"had first brought Mr. Mitchett?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham, meeting her friend's eyes, looked for an instant as if\r\n",
      "trying to recall. \"I give it up. I muddle beginnings.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That doesn't matter if you only MAKE them,\" the Duchess smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, does it?\" To which Mrs. Brookenham added: \"Did he bring Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett for Aggie?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If he did they'll have been disappointed. Neither of them has seen, in\r\n",
      "my house, the tip of her nose.\" The Duchess announced it with a pomp of\r\n",
      "pride.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Prevent what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why what I suppose you call the pourparlers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For Aggie's hand? My dear,\" said the Duchess, \"I'm glad you do me the\r\n",
      "justice of feeling that I'm a person to take time by the forelock. It\r\n",
      "was not, as you seem to remember, with the sight of Mr. Mitchett that\r\n",
      "the question of Aggie's hand began to occupy me. I should be ashamed of\r\n",
      "myself if it weren't constantly before me and if I hadn't my feelers\r\n",
      "out in more quarters than one. But I've not so much as thought of\r\n",
      "Mr. Mitchett--who, rich as he may be, is the son of a shoemaker and\r\n",
      "superlatively hideous--for a reason I don't at all mind telling you.\r\n",
      "Don't be outraged if I say that I've for a long time hoped you yourself\r\n",
      "would find the right use for him.\" She paused--at present with a\r\n",
      "momentary failure of assurance, from which she rallied, however, to\r\n",
      "proceed with a burst of earnestness that was fairly noble. \"Forgive me\r\n",
      "if I just tell you once for all how it strikes me, I'm stupefied at your\r\n",
      "not seeming to recognise either your interest or your duty. Oh I\r\n",
      "know you want to, but you appear to me--in your perfect good faith of\r\n",
      "course--utterly at sea. They're one and the same thing, don't you make\r\n",
      "out? your interest and your duty. Why isn't it convincingly plain to you\r\n",
      "that the thing to do with Nanda is just to marry her--and to marry her\r\n",
      "soon? That's the great thing--do it while you CAN. If you don't want\r\n",
      "her downstairs--at which, let me say, I don't in the least wonder--your\r\n",
      "remedy is to take the right alternative. Don't send her to Tishy--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Send her to Mr. Mitchett?\" Mrs. Brookenham unresentfully quavered. Her\r\n",
      "colour, during her visitor's address had distinctly risen, but there was\r\n",
      "no irritation in her voice. \"How do you know, Jane, that I don't want\r\n",
      "her downstairs?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess looked at her with an audacity confirmed by the absence\r\n",
      "from her face of everything but the plaintive. \"There you are, with your\r\n",
      "eternal English false positions! J'aime, moi, les situations nettes--je\r\n",
      "rien comprends pas d'autres. It wouldn't be to your honour--to that of\r\n",
      "your delicacy--that with your impossible house you SHOULD wish to plant\r\n",
      "your girl in your drawing-room. But such a way of keeping her out of it\r\n",
      "as throwing her into a worse--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Jane, you do say things to me!\" Mrs. Brookenham blandly broke\r\n",
      "in. She had sunk back into her chair; her hands, in her lap pressed\r\n",
      "themselves together and her wan smile brought a tear into each of her\r\n",
      "eyes by the very effort to be brighter. It might have been guessed of\r\n",
      "her that she hated to seem to care, but that she had other dislikes too.\r\n",
      "\"If one were to take up, you know, some of the things you say--!\" And\r\n",
      "she positively sighed for the wealth of amusement at them of which her\r\n",
      "tears were the sign. Her friend could quite match her indifference.\r\n",
      "\"Well, my child, TAKE them up; if you were to do that with them\r\n",
      "candidly, one by one, you would do really very much what I should like\r\n",
      "to bring you to. Do you see?\" Mrs. Brookenham's failure to repudiate the\r\n",
      "vision appeared to suffice, and her visitor cheerfully took a further\r\n",
      "jump. \"As much of Tishy as she wants--AFTER. But not before.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"After what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--say after Mr. Mitchett. Mr. Mitchett won't take her after Mrs.\r\n",
      "Grendon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what are your grounds for assuming that he'll take her at all?\"\r\n",
      "Then as the Duchess hung fire a moment: \"Have you got it by chance from\r\n",
      "Lord Petherton?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The eyes of the two women met for a little on this, and there might have\r\n",
      "been a consequence of it in the manner of what came. \"I've got it from\r\n",
      "not being a fool. Men, I repeat, like the girls they marry--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I already know your old song! The way they like the girls they\r\n",
      "DON'T marry seems to be,\" Mrs. Brookenham mused, \"what more immediately\r\n",
      "concerns us. You had better wait till you HAVE made Aggie's fortune\r\n",
      "perhaps--to be so sure of the working of your system. Pardon me,\r\n",
      "darling, if I don't take you for an example until you've a little more\r\n",
      "successfully become one. I know what the sort of men worth speaking of\r\n",
      "are not looking for. They ARE looking for smart safe sensible English\r\n",
      "girls.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess glanced at the clock. \"What's Mr. Vanderbank looking for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion appeared to oblige her by anxiously thinking. \"Oh, HE, I'm\r\n",
      "afraid, poor dear--for nothing at all!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess had taken off a glove to appease her appetite, and now,\r\n",
      "drawing it on, she smoothed it down. \"I think he has his ideas.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The same as yours?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, more like them than like yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah perhaps then--for he and I,\" said Mrs. Brookenham, \"don't agree, I\r\n",
      "feel, on two things in the world. So you think poor Mitchy,\" she went\r\n",
      "on, \"who's the son of a shoemaker and who might be the grandson of a\r\n",
      "grasshopper, good enough for my child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess appreciated for a moment the superior fit of her glove. \"I\r\n",
      "look facts in the face. It's exactly what I'm doing for Aggie.\" Then she\r\n",
      "grew easy to extravagance. \"What are you giving her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mrs. Brookenham took without wincing whatever, as between a\r\n",
      "masterful relative and an exposed frivolity, might have been the sting\r\n",
      "of it. \"That you must ask Edward. I haven't the least idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There you are again--the virtuous English mother! I've got Aggie's\r\n",
      "little fortune in an old stocking and I count it over every night. If\r\n",
      "you've no old stocking for Nanda there are worse fates than shoemakers\r\n",
      "and grasshoppers. Even WITH one, you know, I don't at all say that I\r\n",
      "should sniff at poor Mitchy. We must take what we can get and I shall be\r\n",
      "the first to take it. You can't have everything for ninepence.\" And the\r\n",
      "Duchess got up--shining, however, with a confessed light of fantasy.\r\n",
      "\"Speak to him, my dear--speak to him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean offer him my child?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She laughed at the intonation. \"There you are once more--vous autres! If\r\n",

      "mine to the son of a chimney-sweep if the principal guarantees were\r\n",
      "there. Nanda's charming--you don't do her justice. I don't say Mr.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord Petherton--on Mr. Mitchett?\" The Duchess stared, but rather in\r\n",
      "amusement than in horror. \"Why, hasn't he a--property?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The loveliest. Mr. Mitchett's his property. Didn't you KNOW?\" There was\r\n",
      "an artless wail in Mrs. Brookenham's surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How should I know--still a stranger as I'm often rather happy to feel\r\n",
      "myself here and choosing my friends and picking my steps very much, I\r\n",
      "can assure you--how should I know about all your social scandals and\r\n",
      "things?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh we don't call THAT a social scandal!\" Mrs. Brookenham inimitably\r\n",
      "returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if you should wish to you'd have the way I tell you of to stop\r\n",
      "it. Divert the stream of Mr. Mitchett's wealth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh there's plenty for every one!\"--Mrs. Brookenham kept up her tone.\r\n",
      "\"He's always giving us things--bonbons and dinners and opera-boxes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has never given ME any,\" the Duchess contentedly declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham waited a little. \"Lord Petherton has the giving of some.\r\n",
      "He has never in his life before, I imagine, made so many presents.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah then it's a shame one has nothing!\" On which before reaching the\r\n",
      "door, the Duchess changed the subject. \"You say I never bring Aggie. If\r\n",
      "you like I'll bring her back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham wondered. \"Do you mean today?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, when I've picked her up. It will be something to do with her till\r\n",
      "Miss Merriman can take her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Delighted, dearest; do bring her. And I think she should SEE Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shall I find him here too then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh take the chance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two women, on this, exchanged, tacitly and across the room--the\r\n",
      "Duchess at the door, which a servant had arrived to open for her, and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham still at her tea-table--a further stroke of intercourse,\r\n",
      "over which the latter was not on this occasion the first to lower her\r\n",
      "lids. \"I think I've shown high scruples,\" the departing guest said, \"but\r\n",
      "I understand then that I'm free.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Free as air, dear Jane.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good.\" Then just as she was off, \"Ah dear old Edward!\" the guest\r\n",
      "exclaimed. Her kinsman, as she was fond of calling him, had reached the\r\n",
      "top of the staircase, and Mrs. Brookenham, by the fire, heard them meet\r\n",
      "on the landing--heard also the Duchess protest against his turning to\r\n",
      "see her down. Mrs. Brookenham, listening to them, hoped Edward would\r\n",
      "accept the protest and think it sufficient to leave her with the\r\n",
      "footman. Their common consciousness that she was a kind of cousin, a\r\n",
      "consciousness not devoid of satisfaction, was quite consistent with a\r\n",
      "view, early arrived at, of the absurdity of any fuss about her.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Mr. Brookenham appeared his wife was prompt. \"She's coming back for\r\n",
      "Lord Petherton.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" he simply said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's something between them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" he merely repeated. And it would have taken many such sounds on\r\n",
      "his part to represent a spirit of response discernible to any one but\r\n",
      "his mate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There have been things before,\" she went on, \"but I haven't felt sure.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It couldn't be said of Edward Brookenham, who seemed to bend for sitting\r\n",
      "down more hinges than most men, that he looked as if he knew either this\r\n",
      "or anything else. He had a pale cold face, marked and made regular, made\r\n",
      "even in a manner handsome, by a hardness of line in which, oddly,\r\n",
      "there was no significance, no accent. Clean-shaven, slightly bald, with\r\n",
      "unlighted grey eyes and a mouth that gave the impression of not working\r\n",
      "easily, he suggested a stippled drawing by an inferior master. Lean\r\n",
      "moreover and stiff, and with the air of having here and there in his\r\n",
      "person a bone or two more than his share, he had once or twice, at\r\n",
      "fancy-balls, been thought striking in a dress copied from one of\r\n",
      "Holbein's English portraits. But when once some such meaning as that had\r\n",
      "been put into him it took a long time to put another, a longer time than\r\n",
      "even his extreme exposure or anybody's study of the problem had yet made\r\n",
      "possible. If anything particular had finally been expected from him it\r\n",
      "might have been a summary or an explanation of the things he had always\r\n",
      "not said; but there was something in him that had long since pacified\r\n",
      "all impatience, drugged all curiosity. He had never in his life answered\r\n",
      "such a question as his wife had just put him and which she would\r\n",
      "not have put had she feared a reply. So dry and decent and even\r\n",
      "distinguished did he look, as if he had positively been created to\r\n",
      "meet a propriety and match some other piece, that lady, with her famous\r\n",
      "perceptions, would no more have appealed to him seriously on a\r\n",
      "general proposition than she would, for such a response, have rung the\r\n",
      "drawing-room bell. He was none the less held to have a great promiscuous\r\n",
      "wisdom. \"What is it that's between them?\" he demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's between any woman and the man she's making up to?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why there may often be nothing. I didn't know she even particularly\r\n",
      "knew him,\" Brookenham added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's exactly what she would like to prevent any one's knowing, and her\r\n",
      "coming here to be with him when she knows I know SHE knows--don't you\r\n",
      "see?--that he's to be here, is just one of those calculations that ARE\r\n",
      "subtle enough to put off the scent a woman who has but half a\r\n",
      "nose.\" Mrs. Brookenham as she spoke appeared to attest by the pretty\r\n",
      "star-gazing way she thrust it into the air her own possession of the\r\n",
      "totality of such a feature. \"I don't know yet quite what I think, but\r\n",
      "one wakes up to such things soon enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you suppose it's her idea that he'll marry her?\" Brookenham asked in\r\n",
      "his colourless way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear Edward!\" his wife murmured for all answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But if she can see him in other places why should she want to see him\r\n",
      "here?\" Edward persisted in a voice destitute of expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham now had plenty of that. \"Do you mean if she can see him\r\n",
      "in his own house?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No cream, please,\" her husband said. \"Hasn't she a house too?\"\r\n",

      "\"Yes, but so pervaded all over by Aggie and Miss Merriman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"There has always been some man--I've always known there has. And now\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But where's the attraction?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In HIM? Why lots of women could tell you. Petherton has had a career.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "one else. She has also such great elements.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I dare say she's all right,\" Brookenham returned as if his interest\r\n",
      "in the case had dropped. You might have felt you got a little nearer to\r\n",
      "him on guessing that in so peopled a circle satiety was never far from\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Surely I told you Nanda's to be with her for Easter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I believe you did,\" he bethought himself, \"but you didn't say anything\r\n",
      "about a craze. And where's Harold?\" he went on.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Brookenham just traceably took this in, but to what profit was not\r\n",
      "calculable. \"To Harold? Very good-natured.\" He had another short\r\n",
      "reflexion, after which he continued: \"If they don't send he'll be in for\r\n",

      "ten shillings.\"\r\n",

      "Mrs. Brookenham hesitated. \"From whom do you mean--the Jews?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at her as if her vagueness might be assumed. \"No. They, I take\r\n",

      "ladies. He gets it from Mitchy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Mrs. Brookenham. \"Are you very sure?\" she then demanded.\r\n",

      "afterwards a little about the room and looking out, as his wife had done\r\n",
      "half an hour before, at the dreary rain and the now duskier ugliness. He\r\n",
      "reverted in this attitude, with a complete unconsciousness of making for\r\n",
      "irritation, to an issue they might be supposed to have dropped. \"He'll\r\n",
      "have a lovely drive for his money!\" His companion, however, said nothing\r\n",
      "and he presently came round again. \"No, I'm not absolutely sure--of his\r\n",
      "having had it from Mitchy. If I were I should do something.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What would you do?\" She put it as if she couldn't possibly imagine.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"To Harold?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--that might just put it into his head.\" Brookenham walked up\r\n",
      "and down a little with his hands in his pockets, after which, with\r\n",
      "a complete concealment of the steps of the transition, \"Where are we\r\n",
      "dining to-night?\" he brought out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nowhere, thank heaven. We grace our own board.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh--with those fellows, as you said, and Jane?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's not for dinner. The Baggers and Mary Pinthorpe and--upon my word\r\n",
      "I forget.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll see when she comes,\" suggested Brookenham, who was again at the\r\n",
      "window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It isn't a she--it's two or three he's, I think,\" his wife replied\r\n",
      "with her indifferent anxiety. \"But I don't know what dinner it is,\" she\r\n",
      "bethought herself; \"it may be the one that's after Easter. Then that\r\n",
      "one's this one,\" she added with her eyes once more on her book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it's a relief to dine at home\"--and Brookenham faced about.\r\n",
      "\"Would you mind finding out?\" he asked with some abruptness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean who's to dine?\"\r\n",

      "\"No, that doesn't matter. But whether Mitchy HAS come down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can only find out by asking him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh _I_ could ask him.\" He seemed disappointed at his wife's want of\r\n",
      "resource.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you don't want to?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked coldly, from before the fire, over the prettiness of her brown\r\n",
      "bent head. \"It will be such a beastly bore if he admits it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you think poor I can make him not admit it?\" She put the question\r\n",
      "as if it were really her own thought too, but they were a couple who\r\n",
      "could, even face to face and unlike the augurs behind the altar, think\r\n",
      "these things without laughing. \"If he SHOULD admit it,\" Mrs. Brookenham\r\n",
      "threw in, \"will you give me the money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To pay Mitchy back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had now raised her eyes to her husband, but, turning away, he failed\r\n",
      "to meet them. \"He'll deny it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if they all deny it,\" she presently remarked, \"it's a simple\r\n",
      "enough matter. I'm sure _I_ don't want them to come down on us! But\r\n",
      "that's the advantage,\" she almost prattled on, \"of having so many such\r\n",
      "charming friends. They DON'T come down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This again was a remark of a sweep that there appeared to be nothing in\r\n",
      "Brookenham's mind to match; so that, scarcely pausing in the walk he had\r\n",
      "resumed, he only said: \"Who do you mean by 'all'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why if he has had anything from Mitchy I dare say he has had something\r\n",
      "from Van.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" Brookenham returned as if with a still deeper drop of interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They oughtn't to do it,\" she declared; \"they ought to tell us, and when\r\n",
      "they don't it serves them right.\" Even this observation, however, failed\r\n",
      "to rouse in her husband a response, and, as she had quite formed the\r\n",
      "habit of doing, she philosophically answered herself. \"But I don't\r\n",
      "suppose they do it on spec.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was less apparent than ever what Edward supposed. \"Oh Van hasn't\r\n",
      "money to chuck about.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah I only mean a sovereign here and there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Brookenham threw out after another turn, \"I think Van, you know,\r\n",
      "is your affair.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It ALL seems to be my affair!\" she lamented too woefully to have other\r\n",
      "than a comic effect. \"And of course then it will be still more so if he\r\n",
      "should begin to apply to Mr. Longdon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We must stop that in time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean by warning Mr. Longdon and requesting him immediately to\r\n",
      "tell us? That won't be very pleasant,\" Mrs. Brookenham noted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then wait and see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She waited only a minute--it might have appeared she already saw. \"I\r\n",
      "want him to be kind to Harold and can't help thinking he will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but I fancy that that will be his notion of it--keeping him from\r\n",
      "making debts. I dare say one needn't trouble about him,\" Brookenham\r\n",
      "added. \"He can take care of himself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He appears to have done so pretty well all these years,\" she mused. \"As\r\n",
      "I saw him in my childhood I see him now, and I see now that I saw\r\n",
      "then even how awfully in love he was with mamma. He's too lovely about\r\n",
      "mamma,\" Mrs. Brookenham pursued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" her husband replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The vivid past held her a moment. \"I see now I must have known a lot as\r\n",
      "a child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" her companion repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I want him to take an interest in us. Above all in the children. He\r\n",
      "ought to like us\"--she followed it up. \"It will be a sort of 'poetic\r\n",
      "justice.' He sees the reasons for himself and we mustn't prevent it.\"\r\n",
      "She turned the possibilities over, but they produced a reserve. \"The\r\n",
      "thing is I don't see how he CAN like Harold.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then he won't lend him money,\" said Brookenham with all his grimness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This contingency too she considered. \"You make me feel as if I wished he\r\n",
      "would--which is too dreadful. And I don't think he really likes ME!\" she\r\n",
      "went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" her husband again ejaculated. \"I mean not utterly REALLY. He has\r\n",
      "to try to. But it won't make any difference,\" she next remarked. \"Do you\r\n",
      "mean his trying?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I mean his not succeeding. He'll be just the same.\" She saw it\r\n",
      "steadily and saw it whole. \"On account of mamma.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brookenham also, with his perfect propriety, put it before himself. \"And\r\n",
      "will he--on account of your mother--also like ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She weighed it. \"No, Edward.\" She covered him with her loveliest\r\n",
      "expression. \"No, not really either. But it won't make any difference.\"\r\n",
      "This time she had pulled him up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not if he doesn't like Harold or like you or like me?\" Edward clearly\r\n",
      "found himself able to accept only the premise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll be perfectly loyal. It will be the advantage of mamma!\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brookenham cried. \"Mamma, Edward,\" she brought out with a flash of\r\n",
      "solemnity--\"mamma WAS wonderful. There have been times when I've always\r\n",
      "felt her still with us, but Mr. Longdon makes it somehow so real.\r\n",
      "Whether she's with me or not, at any rate, she's with HIM; so that when\r\n",
      "HE'S with me, don't you see--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It comes to the same thing?\" her husband intelligently asked. \"I see.\r\n",
      "And when was he with you last?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not since the day he dined--but that was only last week. He'll come\r\n",
      "soon--I know from Van.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what does Van know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh all sorts of things. He has taken the greatest fancy to him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The old boy--to Van?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Van to Mr. Longdon. And the other way too. Mr. Longdon has been most\r\n",
      "kind to him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brookenham still moved about. \"Well, if he likes Van and doesn't like\r\n",
      "US, what good will that do us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh the things you expect me to feel, my dear!\" Edward Brookenham\r\n",
      "lightly moaned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "mamma.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The statement produced on his part an unusual vision of the comedy\r\n",
      "of things. \"Every Jenny has her Jockey!\" Yet perhaps--remarkably\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Longdon? Oh very good. Mamma wouldn't have been the loser. Not that\r\n",

      "facial sign a certain pleasant brutality, the effect partly of a bold\r\n",
      "handsome parade of carnivorous teeth, partly of an expression of nose\r\n",
      "suggesting that this feature had paid a little, in the heat of youth,\r\n",
      "for some aggression at the time admired and even publicly commemorated.\r\n",
      "He would have been ugly, he substantively granted, had he not been\r\n",
      "happy; he would have been dangerous had he not been warranted. Many\r\n",
      "things doubtless performed for him this last service, but none so much\r\n",

      "man, a nature reclaimed, supercivilised, adjusted to the perpetual\r\n",
      "\"chaff\" which kept him smiling in a way that would have been a mistake\r\n",
      "and indeed an impossibility if he had really been witty. His bright\r\n",
      "familiarity was that of a young prince whose confidence had never had to\r\n",

      "his colourless eyes and the positive attention drawn to his chin by the\r\n",
      "precipitation of its retreat from discovery. Dressed on the other hand\r\n",
      "not as gentlemen dress in London to pay their respects to the fair, he\r\n",

      "superficially disposed to gaiety, deprived him of the resource of\r\n",
      "shyness and shade, the effect of comedy might not escape him if secured\r\n",
      "by a real plunge. There was comedy therefore in the form of his pot-hat\r\n",
      "and the colour of his spotted shirt, in the systematic disagreement,\r\n",
      "above all, of his coat, waistcoat and trousers. It was only on long\r\n",

      "had to take any in your life, you're the spoiled child of fortune\r\n",
      "and you skim over the surface of things in a way that seems often to\r\n",
      "represent you as supposing everybody else has wings. Most other people\r\n",
      "are sticking fast in their native mud.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mud, Mrs. Brook--mud, mud!\" he protestingly cried as, while he watched\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that's what a great deal of the element really appears to-day to\r\n",

      "books you were so good as to send me and which--really this time, you\r\n",
      "extraordinary man!\" She fell back, intimately reproachful, from the\r\n",
      "effect produced on her, renouncing all expression save that of the\r\n",
      "rolled eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, were they particularly dreadful?\"--Mitchy was honestly surprised.\r\n",
      "\"I rather liked the one in the pink cover--what's the confounded thing\r\n",
      "called?--I thought it had a sort of a something-or-other.\" He had cast\r\n",
      "his eye about as if for a glimpse of the forgotten title, and she caught\r\n",
      "the question as he vaguely and good-humouredly dropped it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A kind of a morbid modernity? There IS that,\" she dimly conceded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that what they call it? Awfully good name. You must have got it from\r\n",
      "old Van!\" he gaily declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I dare say I did. I get the good things from him and the bad ones from\r\n",
      "you. But you're not to suppose,\" Mrs. Brookenham went on, \"that I've\r\n",
      "discussed your horrible book with him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come, I say!\" Mr. Mitchett protested; \"I've seen you with books from\r\n",
      "Vanderbank which if you HAVE discussed them with him--well,\" he laughed,\r\n",
      "\"I should like to have been there!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You haven't seen me with anything like yours--no, no, never, never!\"\r\n",
      "She was particularly positive. \"Van on the contrary gives tremendous\r\n",
      "warnings, makes apologies, in advance, for things that--well, after all,\r\n",
      "haven't killed one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That have even perhaps a little, after the warnings, let one down?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She took no notice of this coarse pleasantry, she simply adhered to her\r\n",
      "thesis. \"One has taken one's dose and one isn't such a fool as to be\r\n",
      "deaf to some fresh true note if it happens to turn up. But for abject\r\n",
      "horrid unredeemed vileness from beginning to end--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So you read to the end?\" Mr. Mitchett interposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I read to see what you could possibly have sent such things to me for,\r\n",
      "and because so long as they were in my hands they were not in the hands\r\n",
      "of others. Please to remember in future that the children are all over\r\n",
      "the place and that Harold and Nanda have their nose in everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I promise to remember,\" Mr. Mitchett returned, \"as soon as you make old\r\n",
      "Van do the same.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do make old Van--I pull old Van up much oftener than I succeed in\r\n",
      "pulling you. I must say,\" Mrs. Brookenham went on, \"you're all getting\r\n",
      "to require among you in general an amount of what one may call editing!\"\r\n",
      "She gave one of her droll universal sighs. \"I've got your books at any\r\n",
      "rate locked up and I wish you'd send for them quickly again; one's too\r\n",
      "nervous about anything happening and their being perhaps found among\r\n",
      "one's relics. Charming literary remains!\" she laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The friendly Mitchy was also much amused. \"By Jove, the most awful\r\n",
      "things ARE found! Have you heard about old Randage and what his\r\n",
      "executors have just come across? The most abominable--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I haven't heard,\" she broke in, \"and I don't want to; but you give me\r\n",
      "a shudder and I beg you'll have your offerings removed, since I can't\r\n",
      "think of confiding them for the purpose to any one in this house. I\r\n",
      "might burn them up in the dead of night, but even then I should be\r\n",
      "fearfully nervous.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll send then my usual messenger,\" said Mitchy, \"a person I keep\r\n",
      "for such jobs, thoroughly seasoned, as you may imagine, and of a\r\n",
      "discretion--what do you call it?--a toute epreuve. Only you must let\r\n",
      "me say that I like your terror about Harold! Do you think he spends his\r\n",
      "time over Dr. Watts's hymns?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham just hesitated, and nothing, in general, was so becoming\r\n",
      "to her as the act of hesitation. \"Dear Mitchy, do you know I want\r\n",
      "awfully to talk to you about Harold?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About his French reading, Mrs. Brook?\" Mitchy responded with interest.\r\n",
      "\"The worse things are, let me just mention to you about that, the better\r\n",
      "they seem positively to be for one's feeling up in the language. They're\r\n",
      "more difficult, the bad ones--and there's a lot in that. All the young\r\n",
      "men know it--those who are going up for exams.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had her eyes for a little on Lord Petherton and her husband; then\r\n",
      "as if she had not heard what her interlocutor had just said she overcame\r\n",
      "her last scruple. \"Dear Mitchy, has he had money from you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stared with his good goggle eyes--he laughed out. \"Why on earth--?\r\n",
      "But do you suppose I'd tell you if he had?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He hasn't really borrowed the most dreadful sums?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy was highly diverted. \"Why should he? For what, please?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just it--for what? What does he do with it all? What in the\r\n",
      "world becomes of it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Mitchy suggested, \"he's saving up to start a business. Harold's\r\n",
      "irreproachable--hasn't a vice. Who knows in these days what may happen?\r\n",
      "He sees further than any young man I know. Do let him save.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked far away with her sweet world-weariness. \"If you weren't\r\n",
      "an angel it would be a horror to be talking to you. But I insist on\r\n",
      "knowing.\" She insisted now with her absurdly pathetic eyes on him. \"What\r\n",
      "kind of sums?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You shall never, never find out--not if you were never to speak to me\r\n",
      "again,\" Mr. Mitchett replied with extravagant firmness. \"Harold's one of\r\n",
      "my great amusements--I really have awfully few; and if you deprive me of\r\n",
      "him you'll be a fiend. There are only one or two things I want to live\r\n",
      "for, but one of them is to see how far Harold will go. Please give me\r\n",
      "some more tea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you positively swear?\" she asked with intensity as she helped him.\r\n",
      "Then without waiting for his answer: \"You have the common charity to US,\r\n",
      "I suppose, to see the position you'd put us in. Fancy Edward!\" she quite\r\n",
      "austerely threw off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mitchett, at this, had on his side a wonder. \"Does Edward\r\n",
      "imagine--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear man, Edward never 'imagined' anything in life.\" She still had\r\n",
      "her eyes on him. \"Therefore if he SEES a thing, don't you know? it must\r\n",
      "exist.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy for a little fixed the person mentioned as he sat with his other\r\n",
      "guest, but whatever this person saw he failed just then to see his\r\n",
      "wife's companion, whose eyes he never met. His face only offered itself\r\n",
      "after the fashion of a clean domestic vessel, a receptacle with the\r\n",
      "peculiar property of constantly serving yet never filling, to Lord\r\n",
      "Petherton's talkative splash. \"Well, only don't let him take it up.\r\n",
      "Let it be only between you and me,\" Mr. Mitchett pleaded; \"keep him\r\n",
      "quiet--don't let him speak to me.\" He appeared to convey with his\r\n",
      "pleasant extravagance that Edward looked dangerous, and he went on with\r\n",
      "a rigour of levity: \"It must be OUR little quarrel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were different ways of meeting such a tone, but Mrs. Brookenham's\r\n",
      "choice was remarkably prompt. \"I don't think I quite understand what\r\n",
      "dreadful joke you may be making, but I dare say if you HAD let Harold\r\n",
      "borrow you'd have another manner, and I was at any rate determined to\r\n",
      "have the question out with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us always have everything out--that's quite my own idea. It's you,\"\r\n",
      "said Mr. Mitchett, \"who are by no means always so frank with me as I\r\n",
      "recognise--oh, I do THAT!--what it must have cost you to be over this\r\n",
      "little question of Harold. There's one thing, Mrs. Brook, you do dodge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do I ever dodge, dear Mitchy?\" Mrs. Brook quite tenderly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, when I ask you about your other child you're off like a frightened\r\n",
      "fawn. When have you ever, on my doing so, said 'my darling Mitchy,\r\n",
      "I'll ring for her to be asked to come down so that you can see her for\r\n",
      "yourself'--when have you ever said anything like that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see,\" Mrs. Brookenham mused; \"you think I sacrifice her. You're very\r\n",
      "interesting among you all, and I've certainly a delightful circle. The\r\n",
      "Duchess has just been letting me have it most remarkably hot, and as\r\n",
      "she's presently coming back you'll be able to join forces with her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy looked a little at a loss. \"On the subject of your sacrifice--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of my innocent and helpless, yet somehow at the same time, as a\r\n",
      "consequence of my cynicism, dreadfully damaged and depraved daughter.\"\r\n",
      "She took in for an instant the slight bewilderment against which, as a\r\n",
      "result of her speech, even so expert an intelligence as Mr. Mitchett's\r\n",
      "had not been proof; then with a small jerk of her head at the other side\r\n",
      "of the room made the quickest of transitions. \"What IS there between her\r\n",
      "and him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy wondered at the other two. \"Between Edward and the girl?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't talk nonsense. Between Petherton and Jane.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy could only stare, and the wide noonday light of his regard was at\r\n",
      "such moments really the redemption of his ugliness. \"What 'is' there? Is\r\n",
      "there anything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's too beautiful,\" Mrs. Brookenham appreciatively sighed, \"your\r\n",
      "relation with him! You won't compromise him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It would be nicer of me,\" Mitchy laughed, \"not to want to compromise\r\n",
      "HER!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Jane!\" Mrs. Brookenham dropped. \"DOES he like her?\" she continued.\r\n",
      "\"You must know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah it's just my knowing that constitutes the beauty of my loyalty--of\r\n",
      "my delicacy.\" He had his quick jumps too. \"Am I never, never to see the\r\n",
      "child?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This enquiry appeared only to confirm his friend in the view of what was\r\n",
      "touching in him. \"You're the most delicate thing I know, and it crops up\r\n",
      "with effect the oddest in the intervals of your corruption. Your talk's\r\n",
      "half the time impossible; you respect neither age nor sex nor condition;\r\n",
      "one doesn't know what you'll say or do next; and one has to return your\r\n",
      "books--c'est tout dire--under cover of darkness. Yet there's in the\r\n",
      "midst of all this and in the general abyss of you a little deepdown\r\n",
      "delicious niceness, a sweet sensibility, that one has actually one's\r\n",
      "self, shocked as one perpetually is at you, quite to hold one's breath\r\n",
      "and stay one's hand for fear of ruffling or bruising. There's no one\r\n",
      "in talk with whom,\" she balmily continued, \"I find myself half so\r\n",
      "often suddenly moved to pull up short. You've more little toes to tread\r\n",
      "on--though you pretend you haven't: I mean morally speaking, don't you\r\n",
      "know?--than even I have myself, and I've so many that I could wish most\r\n",
      "of them cut off. You never spare me a shock--no, you don't do that: it\r\n",
      "isn't the form your delicacy takes. But you'll know what I mean, all the\r\n",
      "same, I think, when I tell you that there are lots I spare YOU!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mitchett fairly glowed with the candour of his attention. \"Know what\r\n",
      "you mean, dearest lady? How can a man handicapped to death, a man of\r\n",
      "my origin, my appearance, my general weaknesses, drawbacks, immense\r\n",
      "indebtedness, all round, for the start, as it were, that I feel my\r\n",
      "friends have been so good as to allow me: how can such a man not be\r\n",
      "conscious every moment that every one about him goes on tiptoe and winks\r\n",
      "at every one else? What CAN you all mention in my presence, poor things,\r\n",
      "that isn't personal?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham's face covered him for an instant as no painted\r\n",
      "Madonna's had ever covered the little charge at the breast beneath it.\r\n",
      "\"And the finest thing of all in you is your beautiful, beautiful pride!\r\n",
      "You're prouder than all of us put together.\" She checked a motion that\r\n",
      "he had apparently meant as a protest--she went on with her muffled\r\n",
      "wisdom. \"There isn't a man but YOU whom Petherton wouldn't have made\r\n",
      "vulgar. He isn't vulgar himself--at least not exceptionally; but he's\r\n",
      "just one of those people, a class one knows well, who are so fearfully,\r\n",
      "in this country, the cause of it in others. For all I know he's the\r\n",
      "cause of it in me--the cause of it even in poor Edward. For I'm vulgar,\r\n",
      "Mitchy dear--very often; and the marvel of you is that you never are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you for everything. Thank you above all for 'marvel'!\" Mitchy\r\n",
      "grinned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know what I say!\"--she didn't in the least blush. \"I'll tell you\r\n",
      "something,\" she pursued with the same gravity, \"if you'll promise\r\n",
      "to tell no one on earth. If you're proud I'm not. There! It's most\r\n",
      "extraordinary and I try to conceal it even to myself; but there's no\r\n",
      "doubt whatever about it--I'm not proud pour deux sous. And some day, on\r\n",
      "some awful occasion, I shall show it. So--I notify you. Shall you love\r\n",
      "me still?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the bitter end,\" Mitchy loyally responded. \"For how CAN, how need,\r\n",
      "a woman be 'proud' who's so preternaturally clever? Pride's only for use\r\n",
      "when wit breaks down--it's the train the cyclist takes when his tire's\r\n",
      "deflated. When that happens to YOUR tire, Mrs. Brook, you'll let me\r\n",
      "know. And you do make me wonder just now,\" he confessed, \"why you're\r\n",
      "taking such particular precautions and throwing out such a cloud of\r\n",
      "skirmishers. If you want to shoot me dead a single bullet will do.\" He\r\n",
      "faltered but an instant before completing his sense. \"Where you really\r\n",
      "want to come out is at the fact that Nanda loathes me and that I might\r\n",
      "as well give up asking for her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you quite serious?\" his companion after a moment resumed. \"Do you\r\n",
      "really and truly like her, Mitchy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I like her as much as I dare to--as much as a man can like a girl when\r\n",
      "from the very first of his seeing her and judging her he has also seen,\r\n",
      "and seen with all the reasons, that there's no chance for him whatever.\r\n",
      "Of course, with all that, he has done his best not to let himself go.\r\n",
      "But there are moments,\" Mr. Mitchett ruefully added, \"when it would\r\n",
      "relieve him awfully to feel free for a good spin.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think you exaggerate,\" his hostess replied, \"the difficulties in your\r\n",
      "way. What do you mean by all the 'reasons'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why one of them I've already mentioned. I make her flesh creep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My own Mitchy!\" Mrs. Brookenham protestingly moaned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The other is that--very naturally--she's in love.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With whom under the sun?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham had, with her startled stare, met his eyes long enough\r\n",
      "to have taken something from him before he next spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You really have never suspected? With whom conceivably but old Van?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nanda's in love with old Van?\"--the degree to which she had never\r\n",
      "suspected was scarce to be expressed. \"Why he's twice her age--he has\r\n",
      "seen her in a pinafore with a dirty face and well slapped for it: he has\r\n",
      "never thought of her in the world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can a person of your acuteness, my dear woman,\" Mitchy asked,\r\n",
      "\"mention such trifles as having the least to do with the case? How\r\n",
      "can you possibly have such a fellow about, so beastly good-looking, so\r\n",
      "infernally well turned out in the way of 'culture,' and so bringing them\r\n",
      "down in short on every side, and expect in the bosom of your family the\r\n",
      "absence of history of the reigns of the good kings? If YOU were a girl\r\n",
      "wouldn't YOU turn purple? If I were a girl shouldn't I--unless, as is\r\n",
      "more likely, I turned green?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham was deeply affected. \"Nanda does turn purple--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The loveliest shade you ever saw. It's too absurd that you haven't\r\n",
      "noticed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was characteristic of Mrs. Brookenham's amiability that, with her\r\n",
      "sudden sense of the importance of this new light, she should be quite\r\n",
      "ready to abase herself. \"There are so many things in one's life. One\r\n",
      "follows false scents. One doesn't make out everything at once. If you're\r\n",
      "right you must help me. We must see more of her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what good will that do me?\" Mitchy appealed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you care enough for her to want to help HER?\" Then before\r\n",
      "he could speak, \"Poor little darling dear!\" his hostess tenderly\r\n",
      "ejaculated. \"What does she think or dream? Truly she's laying up\r\n",
      "treasure!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh he likes her,\" said Mitchy. \"He likes her in fact extremely.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean he has told you so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no--we never mention it! But he likes her,\" Mr. Mitchett stubbornly\r\n",
      "repeated. \"And he's thoroughly straight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham for a moment turned these things over; after which she\r\n",
      "came out in a manner that visibly surprised him. \"It isn't as if you\r\n",
      "wished to be nasty about him, is it?--because I know you like him\r\n",
      "yourself. You're so wonderful to your friends\"--oh she could let him\r\n",
      "see that she knew!--\"and in such different and exquisite ways. There are\r\n",
      "those like HIM\"--she signified her other visitor--\"who get everything\r\n",
      "out of you and whom you really appear fond of, or at least to put up\r\n",
      "with, just FOR that. Then there are those who ask nothing--and whom\r\n",
      "you're fond of in spite of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy leaned back from this, fist within fist, watching her with\r\n",
      "a certain disguised emotion. He grinned almost too much for mere\r\n",
      "amusement. \"That's the class to which YOU belong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's the best one,\" she returned, \"and I'm careful to remain in it. You\r\n",
      "try to get us, by bribery, into the inferior place, because, proud as\r\n",
      "you are, it bores you a little that you like us so much. But we won't\r\n",
      "go--at least I won't. You may make Van,\" she wonderfully continued.\r\n",
      "\"There's nothing you wouldn't do for him or give him.\" Mitchy admired\r\n",
      "her from his position, slowly shaking his head with it. \"He's the\r\n",
      "man--with no fortune and just as he is, to the smallest particular--whom\r\n",
      "you would have liked to be, whom you intensely envy, and yet to whom\r\n",
      "you're magnanimous enough for almost any sacrifice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy's appreciation had fairly deepened to a flush. \"Magnificent,\r\n",
      "magnificent Mrs. Brook! What ARE you in thunder up to?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Therefore, as I say,\" she imperturbably went on, \"it's not to do him an\r\n",
      "ill turn that you make a point of what you've just told me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mitchett for a minute gave no sign but his high colour and his queer\r\n",
      "glare. \"How could it do him an ill turn?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it WOULD be a way, don't you see? to put before me the need of\r\n",
      "getting rid of him. For he may 'like' Nanda as much as you please: he'll\r\n",
      "never, never,\" Mrs. Brookenham resolutely quavered--\"he'll never come to\r\n",
      "the scratch. And to feel that as _I_ do,\" she explained, \"can only be,\r\n",
      "don't you also see? to want to save her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would have appeared at last that poor Mitchy did see. \"By taking it\r\n",
      "in time? By forbidding him the house?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She seemed to stand with little nipping scissors in a garden of\r\n",
      "alternatives. \"Or by shipping HER off. Will you help me to save her?\"\r\n",
      "she broke out again after a moment. \"It isn't true,\" she continued,\r\n",
      "\"that she has any aversion to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you charged her with it?\" Mitchy demanded with a courage that\r\n",
      "amounted to high gallantry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It inspired on the spot his interlocutress, and her own pluck, of as\r\n",
      "fine a quality now as her diplomacy, which was saying much, fell but\r\n",
      "little below. \"Yes, my dear friend--frankly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good. Then I know what she said.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She absolutely denied it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--they always do, because they pity me,\" Mitchy smiled. \"She\r\n",
      "said what they always say--that the effect I produce is, though at first\r\n",
      "upsetting, one that little by little they find it possible to get used\r\n",
      "to. The world's full of people who are getting used to me,\" Mr. Mitchett\r\n",
      "concluded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's what _I_ shall never do, for you're quite too great a luxury!\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham declared. \"If I haven't threshed you out really MORE\r\n",
      "with Nanda,\" she continued, \"it has been from a scruple of a sort you\r\n",
      "people never do a woman the justice to impute. You're the object of\r\n",
      "views that have so much more to set them off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mitchett on this jumped up; he was clearly conscious of his nerves;\r\n",
      "he fidgeted away a few steps and then, his hands in his pockets, fixed\r\n",
      "on his hostess a countenance more controlled. \"What does the Duchess\r\n",
      "mean by your daughter's being--as I understood you to quote her just\r\n",
      "now--'damaged and depraved'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham came up--she literally rose--smiling. \"You fit the cap.\r\n",
      "You know how she'd like you for little Aggie!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What does she mean, what does she mean?\" Mitchy repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door, as he spoke, was thrown open; Mrs. Brookenham glanced round.\r\n",
      "\"You've the chance to find out from herself!\" The Duchess had come back\r\n",
      "and little Aggie was in her wake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "V\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That young lady, in this relation, was certainly a figure to have\r\n",
      "offered a foundation for the highest hopes. As slight and white, as\r\n",
      "delicately lovely, as a gathered garden lily, her admirable training\r\n",
      "appeared to hold her out to them all as with precautionary finger-tips.\r\n",
      "She presumed, however, so little on any introduction that, shyly and\r\n",
      "submissively, waiting for the word of direction, she stopped short\r\n",
      "in the centre of the general friendliness till Mrs. Brookenham fairly\r\n",
      "became, to meet her, also a shy little girl--put out a timid hand with\r\n",
      "wonder-struck innocent eyes that hesitated whether a kiss of greeting\r\n",
      "might be dared. \"Why you dear good strange 'ickle' thing, you haven't\r\n",
      "been here for ages, but it IS a joy to see you and I do hope you've\r\n",
      "brought your doll!\"--such might have been the sense of our friend's fond\r\n",
      "murmur while, looking at her up and down with pure pleasure, she drew\r\n",
      "the rare creature to a sofa. Little Aggie presented, up and down, an\r\n",
      "arrangement of dress exactly in the key of her age, her complexion, her\r\n",
      "emphasised virginity. She might have been prepared for her visit by\r\n",
      "a cluster of doting nuns, cloistered daughters of ancient houses and\r\n",
      "educators of similar products, whose taste, hereditarily good, had\r\n",
      "grown, out of the world and most delightfully, so queer as to leave on\r\n",
      "everything they touched a particular shade of distinction. The Duchess\r\n",
      "had brought in with the child an air of added confidence for which an\r\n",
      "observer would in a moment have seen the grounds, the association of the\r\n",
      "pair being so markedly favourable to each. Its younger member carried\r\n",
      "out the style of her aunt's presence quite as one of the accessory\r\n",
      "figures effectively thrown into old portraits. The Duchess on the other\r\n",
      "hand seemed, with becoming blandness, to draw from her niece the dignity\r\n",
      "of a kind of office of state--hereditary governess of the children of\r\n",
      "the blood. Little Aggie had a smile as softly bright as a Southern dawn,\r\n",
      "and the friends of her relative looked at each other, according to a\r\n",
      "fashion frequent in Mrs. Brookenham's drawing-room, in free exchange of\r\n",
      "their happy impression. Mr. Mitchett was none the less scantly diverted\r\n",
      "from his estimate of the occasion Mrs. Brookenham had just named to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear Duchess,\" he promptly asked, \"do you mind explaining to me an\r\n",
      "opinion I've just heard of your--with marked originality--holding?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess, her head all in the air, considered an instant her little\r\n",
      "ivory princess. \"I'm always ready, Mr. Mitchett, to defend my opinions;\r\n",
      "but if it's a question of going much into the things that are the\r\n",
      "subjects of some of them perhaps we had better, if you don't mind,\r\n",
      "choose our time and our place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No 'time,' gracious lady, for my impatience,\" Mr. Mitchett replied,\r\n",
      "\"could be better than the present--but if you've reasons for wanting a\r\n",
      "better place why shouldn't we go on the spot into another room?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord Petherton, at this enquiry, broke into instant mirth. \"Well, of all\r\n",
      "the coolness, Mitchy!--he does go at it, doesn't he, Mrs. Brook? What\r\n",
      "do you want to do in another room?\" he demanded of his friend. \"Upon my\r\n",
      "word, Duchess, under the nose of those--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess, on the first blush, lent herself to the humour of the case.\r\n",
      "\"Well, Petherton, of 'those'?--I defy him to finish his sentence!\" she\r\n",
      "smiled to the others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of those,\" said his lordship, \"who flatter themselves that when you do\r\n",
      "happen to find them somewhere your first idea is not quite to jump at\r\n",
      "a pretext for getting off somewhere else. Especially,\" he continued to\r\n",
      "jest, \"with a man of Mitchy's vile reputation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" Edward Brookenham exclaimed at this, but only as with quiet\r\n",
      "relief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mitchy's offer is perfectly safe, I may let him know,\" his wife\r\n",
      "remarked, \"for I happen to be sure that nothing would really induce Jane\r\n",
      "to leave Aggie five minutes among us here without remaining herself to\r\n",
      "see that we don't become improper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then if we're already pretty far on the way to it,\" Lord Petherton\r\n",
      "resumed, \"what on earth MIGHT we arrive at in the absence of your\r\n",
      "control? I warn you, Duchess,\" he joyously pursued, \"that if you go out\r\n",
      "of the room with Mitchy I shall rapidly become quite awful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess during this brief passage never took her eyes from her\r\n",
      "niece, who rewarded her attention with the sweetness of consenting\r\n",
      "dependence. The child's foreign origin was so delicately but\r\n",
      "unmistakeably written in all her exquisite lines that her look might\r\n",
      "have expressed the modest detachment of a person to whom the language\r\n",
      "of her companions was unknown. Her protectress then glanced round the\r\n",
      "circle. \"You're very odd people all of you, and I don't think you quite\r\n",
      "know how ridiculous you are. Aggie and I are simple stranger-folk;\r\n",
      "there's a great deal we don't understand, yet we're none the less not\r\n",
      "easily frightened. In what is it, Mr. Mitchett,\" the Duchess asked,\r\n",
      "\"that I've wounded your susceptibilities?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mitchett cast about; he had apparently found time to reflect on his\r\n",
      "precipitation. \"I see what Petherton's up to, and I won't, by drawing\r\n",
      "you aside just now, expose your niece to anything that might immediately\r\n",
      "oblige Mrs. Brook to catch her up and flee with her. But the first\r\n",
      "time I find you more isolated--well,\" he laughed, though not with the\r\n",
      "clearest ring, \"all I can say is Mind your eyes dear Duchess!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's about your thinking, Jane,\" Mrs. Brookenham placidly explained,\r\n",
      "\"that Nanda suffers--in her morals, don't you know?--by my neglect.\r\n",
      "I wouldn't say anything about you that I can't bravely say TO you;\r\n",
      "therefore since he has plumped out with it I do confess that I've\r\n",
      "appealed to him on what, as so good an old friend, HE thinks of your\r\n",
      "contention.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What in the world IS Jane's contention?\" Edward Brookenham put the\r\n",
      "question as if they were \"stuck\" at cards.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You really all of you,\" the Duchess replied with excellent coolness,\r\n",
      "\"choose extraordinary conditions for the discussion of delicate matters.\r\n",
      "There are decidedly too many things on which we don't feel alike. You're\r\n",
      "all inconceivable just now. Je ne peux pourtant pas la mettre a la\r\n",
      "porte, cette cherie\"--whom she covered again with the gay solicitude\r\n",
      "that seemed to have in it a vibration of private entreaty: \"Don't\r\n",
      "understand, my own darling--don't understand!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Little Aggie looked about with an impartial politeness that, as\r\n",
      "an expression of the general blind sense of her being as to every\r\n",
      "particular in hands at full liberty either to spot or to spare her, was\r\n",
      "touching enough to bring tears to all eyes. It perhaps had to do with\r\n",
      "the sudden emotion with which--using now quite a different manner--Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brookenham again embraced her, and even with this lady's equally abrupt\r\n",
      "and altogether wonderful address to her: \"Between you and me straight,\r\n",
      "my dear, and as from friend to friend, I know you'll never doubt that\r\n",
      "everything must be all right!--What I spoke of to poor Mitchy,\" she went\r\n",
      "on to the Duchess, \"is the dreadful view you take of my letting Nanda go\r\n",
      "to Tishy--and indeed of the general question of any acquaintance between\r\n",
      "young unmarried and young married females. Mr. Mitchett's sufficiently\r\n",
      "interested in us, Jane, to make it natural of me to take him into our\r\n",
      "confidence in one of our difficulties. On the other hand we feel your\r\n",
      "solicitude, and I needn't tell you at this time of day what weight\r\n",
      "in every respect we attach to your judgement. Therefore it WILL be a\r\n",
      "difficulty for us, cara mia, don't you see? if we decide suddenly,\r\n",
      "under the spell of your influence, that our daughter must break off a\r\n",
      "friendship--it WILL be a difficulty for us to put the thing to Nanda\r\n",
      "herself in such a way as that she shall have some sort of notion of what\r\n",
      "suddenly possesses us. Then there'll be the much stiffer job of putting\r\n",
      "it to poor Tishy. Yet if her house IS an impossible place what else is\r\n",
      "one to do? Carrie Donner's to be there, and Carrie Donner's a nature\r\n",
      "apart; but how can we ask even a little lamb like Tishy to give up her\r\n",
      "own sister?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question had been launched with an argumentative sharpness that\r\n",
      "made it for a moment keep possession of the air, and during this moment,\r\n",
      "before a single member of the circle could rally, Mrs. Brookenham's\r\n",
      "effect was superseded by that of the reappearance of the butler. \"I say,\r\n",
      "my dear, don't shriek!\"--Edward Brookenham had only time to sound this\r\n",
      "warning before a lady, presenting herself in the open doorway, followed\r\n",
      "close on the announcement of her name. \"Mrs. Beach Donner!\"--the\r\n",
      "impression was naturally marked. Every one betrayed it a little but\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham, who, more than the others, appeared to have the help\r\n",
      "of seeing that by a merciful stroke her visitor had just failed to hear.\r\n",
      "This visitor, a young woman of striking, of startling appearance, who,\r\n",
      "in the manner of certain shiny house-doors and railings, instantly\r\n",
      "created a presumption of the lurking label \"Fresh paint,\" found herself,\r\n",
      "with an embarrassment oddly opposed to the positive pitch of her\r\n",
      "complexion, in the presence of a group in which it was yet immediately\r\n",
      "evident that every one was a friend. Every one, to show no one had been\r\n",
      "caught, said something extremely easy; so that it was after a moment\r\n",
      "only poor Mrs. Donner who, seated close to her hostess, seemed to be\r\n",
      "in any degree in the wrong. This moreover was essentially her fault, so\r\n",
      "extreme was the anomaly of her having, without the means to back it\r\n",
      "up, committed herself to a \"scheme of colour\" that was practically an\r\n",
      "advertisement of courage. Irregularly pretty and painfully shy, she was\r\n",
      "retouched from brow to chin like a suburban photograph--the moral of\r\n",
      "which was simply that she should either have left more to nature or\r\n",
      "taken more from art. The Duchess had quickly reached her kinsman with a\r\n",
      "smothered hiss, an \"Edward dear, for God's sake take Aggie!\" and at the\r\n",
      "end of a few minutes had formed for herself in one of Mrs. Brookenham's\r\n",
      "admirable \"corners\" a society consisting of Lord Petherton and Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett, the latter of whom regarded Mrs. Donner across the room with\r\n",
      "articulate wonder and compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's all right, it's all right--she's frightened only at herself!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess watched her as from a box at the play, comfortably shut\r\n",
      "in, as in the old operatic days at Naples, with a pair of entertainers.\r\n",
      "\"You're the most interesting nation in the world. One never gets to the\r\n",
      "end of your hatred of the nuance. The sense of the suitable, the harmony\r\n",
      "of parts--what on earth were you doomed to do that, to be punished\r\n",
      "sufficiently in advance, you had to be deprived of it in your very\r\n",
      "cradles? Look at her little black dress--rather good, but not so good\r\n",
      "as it ought to be, and, mixed up with all the rest, see her type, her\r\n",
      "beauty, her timidity, her wickedness, her notoriety and her impudeur.\r\n",
      "It's only in this country that a woman is both so shocking and so\r\n",
      "shaky.\" The Duchess's displeasure overflowed. \"If she doesn't know how\r\n",
      "to be good--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let her at least know how to be bad? Ah,\" Mitchy replied, \"your\r\n",
      "irritation testifies more than anything else could do to our peculiar\r\n",
      "genius or our peculiar want of it. Our vice is intolerably clumsy--if it\r\n",
      "can possibly be a question of vice in regard to that charming child, who\r\n",
      "looks like one of the new-fashioned bill-posters, only, in the way of\r\n",
      "'morbid modernity,' as Mrs. Brook would say, more extravagant and funny\r\n",
      "than any that have yet been risked. I remember,\" he continued, \"Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook's having spoken of her to me lately as 'wild.' Wild?--why, she's\r\n",
      "simply tameness run to seed. Such an expression shows the state of\r\n",
      "training to which Mrs. Brook has reduced the rest of us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It doesn't prevent at any rate, Mrs. Brook's training, some of the rest\r\n",
      "of you from being horrible,\" the Duchess declared. \"What did you mean\r\n",
      "just now, really, by asking me to explain before Aggie this so serious\r\n",
      "matter of Nanda's exposure?\" Then instantly taking herself up before Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett could answer: \"What on earth do you suppose Edward's saying to\r\n",
      "my darling?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brookenham had placed himself, side by side with the child, on a distant\r\n",
      "little settee, but it was impossible to make out from the countenance of\r\n",
      "either if a sound had passed between them. Aggie's little manner was too\r\n",
      "developed to show, and her host's not developed enough. \"Oh he's awfully\r\n",
      "careful,\" Lord Petherton reassuringly observed. \"If you or I or\r\n",
      "Mitchy say anything bad it's sure to be before we know it and without\r\n",
      "particularly meaning it. But old Edward means it--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So much that as a general thing he doesn't dare to say it?\" the Duchess\r\n",
      "asked. \"That's a pretty picture of him, inasmuch as for the most part he\r\n",
      "never speaks. What therefore must he mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's an abyss--he's magnificent!\" Mr. Mitchett laughed. \"I don't know\r\n",
      "a man of an understanding more profound, and he's equally incapable of\r\n",
      "uttering and of wincing. If by the same token I'm 'horrible,' as you\r\n",
      "call me,\" he pursued, \"it's only because I'm in everyway so beastly\r\n",
      "superficial. All the same I do sometimes go into things, and I insist\r\n",
      "on knowing,\" he again broke out, \"what it exactly was you had in mind in\r\n",
      "saying to Mrs. Brook the things about Nanda and myself that she repeated\r\n",
      "to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You 'insist,' you silly man?\"--the Duchess had veered a little to\r\n",
      "indulgence. \"Pray on what ground of right, in such a connexion, do you\r\n",
      "do anything of the sort?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Mitchy showed but for a moment that he felt pulled up. \"Do you mean\r\n",
      "that when a girl liked by a fellow likes him so little in return--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't mean anything,\" said the Duchess, \"that may provoke you to\r\n",
      "suppose me vulgar and odious enough to try to put you out of conceit of\r\n",
      "a most interesting and unfortunate creature; and I don't quite as yet\r\n",
      "see--though I dare say I shall soon make out!--what our friend has\r\n",
      "in her head in tattling to you on these matters as soon as my back's\r\n",
      "turned. Petherton will tell you--I wonder he hasn't told you before--why\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grendon, though not perhaps herself quite the rose, is decidedly in\r\n",
      "these days too near it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Petherton never tells me anything!\" Mitchy's answer was brisk and\r\n",
      "impatient, but evidently quite as sincere as if the person alluded to\r\n",
      "had not been there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The person alluded to meanwhile, fidgeting frankly in his chair,\r\n",
      "alternately stretching his legs and resting his elbows on his knees,\r\n",
      "had reckoned as small the profit he might derive from this colloquy. His\r\n",
      "bored state indeed--if he was bored--prompted in him the honest impulse\r\n",
      "to clear, as he would have perhaps considered it, the atmosphere. He\r\n",
      "indicated Mrs. Donner with a remarkable absence of precautions.\r\n",
      "\"Why, what the Duchess alludes to is my poor sister Fanny's stupid\r\n",
      "grievance--surely you know about that.\" He made oddly vivid for a moment\r\n",
      "the nature of his relative's allegation, his somewhat cynical treatment\r\n",
      "of which became peculiarly derisive in the light of the attitude\r\n",
      "and expression, at that minute, of the figure incriminated. \"My\r\n",
      "brother-in-law's too thick with her. But Cashmore's such a fine old ass.\r\n",
      "It's excessively unpleasant,\" he added, \"for affairs are just in that\r\n",
      "position in which, from one day to another, there may be something that\r\n",
      "people will get hold of. Fancy a man,\" he robustly reflected while\r\n",
      "the three took in more completely the subject of Mrs. Brookenham's\r\n",
      "attention--\"fancy a man with THAT odd piece on his hands! The beauty of\r\n",
      "it is that the two women seem never to have broken off. Blest if they\r\n",
      "don't still keep seeing each other!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess, as on everything else, passed succinctly on this. \"Ah how\r\n",
      "can hatreds comfortably flourish without the nourishment of such regular\r\n",
      "'seeing' as what you call here bosom friendship alone supplies? What are\r\n",
      "parties given for in London but--that enemies may meet? I grant you it's\r\n",
      "inconceivable that the husband of a superb creature like your sister\r\n",
      "should find his requirements better met by an object comme cette petite,\r\n",
      "who looks like a pen-wiper--an actress's idea of one--made up for a\r\n",
      "theatrical bazaar. At the same time, if you'll allow me to say so, it\r\n",
      "scarcely strikes one that your sister's prudence is such as to have\r\n",
      "placed all the cards in her hands. She's the most beautiful woman in\r\n",
      "England, but her esprit de conduite isn't quite on a level. One can't\r\n",
      "have everything!\" she philosophically sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord Petherton met her comfortably enough on this assumption of his\r\n",
      "detachments. \"If you mean by that her being the biggest fool alive I'm\r\n",
      "quite ready to agree with you. It's exactly what makes me afraid. Yet\r\n",
      "how can I decently say in especial,\" he asked, \"of what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess still perched on her critical height. \"Of what but one of\r\n",
      "your amazing English periodical public washings of dirty linen? There's\r\n",
      "not the least necessity to 'say'!\" she laughed. \"If there's anything\r\n",
      "more remarkable than these purifications it's the domestic comfort with\r\n",
      "which, when all has come and gone, you sport the articles purified.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It comes back, in all that sphere,\" Mr. Mitchett instructively opined,\r\n",
      "\"to our national, our fatal want of style. We can never, dear Duchess,\r\n",
      "take too many lessons, and there's probably at the present time no more\r\n",
      "useful function to be performed among us than that dissemination of\r\n",
      "neater methods to which you're so good as to contribute.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had had another idea, but before he reached it his companion had\r\n",
      "gaily broken in. \"Awfully good one for you, Duchess--and I'm bound to\r\n",
      "say that, for a clever woman, you exposed yourself! I've at any rate a\r\n",
      "sense of comfort,\" Lord Petherton pursued, \"in the good relations\r\n",
      "now more and more established between poor Fanny and Mrs. Brook. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook's awfully kind to her and awfully sharp, and Fanny will take\r\n",
      "things from her that she won't take from me. I keep saying to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook--don't you know?--'Do keep hold of her and let her have it\r\n",
      "strong.' She hasn't, upon my honour, any one in the world but me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And we know the extent of THAT resource!\" the Duchess freely commented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's exactly what Fanny says--that SHE knows it,\" Petherton\r\n",
      "good-humouredly agreed. \"She says my beastly hypocrisy makes her sick.\r\n",
      "There are people,\" he pleasantly rambled on, \"who are awfully free with\r\n",
      "their advice, but it's mostly fearful rot. Mrs. Brook's isn't, upon my\r\n",
      "word--I've tried some myself!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You talk as if it were something nasty and homemade--gooseberry wine!\"\r\n",
      "the Duchess laughed; \"but one can't know the dear soul, of course,\r\n",
      "without knowing that she has set up, for the convenience of her friends,\r\n",
      "a little office for consultations. She listens to the case, she strokes\r\n",
      "her chin and prescribes--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the beauty of it is,\" cried Lord Petherton, \"that she makes no\r\n",
      "charge whatever!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She doesn't take a guinea at the time, but you may still get your\r\n",
      "account,\" the Duchess returned. \"Of course we know that the great\r\n",
      "business she does is in husbands and wives.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This then seems the day of the wives!\" Mr. Mitchett interposed as he\r\n",
      "became aware, the first, of the illustration the Duchess's image was in\r\n",
      "the act of receiving. \"Lady Fanny Cashmore!\"--the butler was already\r\n",
      "in the field, and the company, with the exception of Mrs. Donner, who\r\n",
      "remained seated, was apparently conscious of a vibration that brought it\r\n",
      "afresh, but still more nimbly than on Aggie's advent, to its feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go to her straight--be nice to her: you must have plenty to say. YOU\r\n",
      "stay with me--we have our affair.\" The latter of these commands the\r\n",
      "Duchess addressed to Mr. Mitchett, while their companion, in obedience\r\n",
      "to the former and affected, as it seemed, by an unrepressed familiar\r\n",
      "accent that stirred a fresh flicker of Mitchy's grin, met the new\r\n",
      "arrival in the middle of the room before Mrs. Brookenham had had time\r\n",
      "to reach her. The Duchess, quickly reseated, watched an instant the\r\n",
      "inexpressive concussion of the tall brother and sister; then while\r\n",
      "Mitchy again subsided into his place, \"You're not, as a race,\r\n",
      "clever, you're not delicate, you're not sane, but you're capable of\r\n",
      "extraordinary good looks,\" she resumed. \"Vous avez parfois la grande\r\n",
      "beaute.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy was much amused. \"Do you really think Petherton has?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess withstood it. \"They've got, both outside and in, the same\r\n",
      "great general things, only turned, in each, rather different ways, a\r\n",
      "way safer for him as a man, and more triumphant for her as--whatever you\r\n",
      "choose to call her! What CAN a woman do,\" she richly mused, \"with such\r\n",
      "beauty as that--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Except come desperately to advise with Mrs. Brook\"--Mitchy undertook to\r\n",
      "complete her question--\"as to the highest use to make of it? But see,\"\r\n",
      "he immediately added, \"how perfectly competent to instruct her our\r\n",
      "friend now looks.\" Their hostess had advanced to Lady Fanny with an\r\n",
      "outstretched hand but with an eagerness of greeting merged a little\r\n",
      "in the sweet predominance of wonder as well as in the habit, at such\r\n",
      "moments most perceptible, of the languid lily-bend. Nothing in general\r\n",
      "could have been less conventionally poor than the kind of reception\r\n",
      "given in Mrs. Brookenham's drawing-room to the particular element--the\r\n",
      "element of physical splendour void of those disparities that make the\r\n",
      "question of others tiresome--comprised in Lady Fanny's presence. It\r\n",
      "was a place in which, at all times, before interesting objects, the\r\n",
      "unanimous occupants, almost more concerned for each other's vibrations\r\n",
      "than for anything else, were apt rather more to exchange sharp and\r\n",
      "silent searchings than to fix their eyes on the object itself. In the\r\n",
      "case of Lady Fanny, however, the object itself--and quite by the same\r\n",
      "law that had worked, though less profoundly, on the entrance of little\r\n",
      "Aggie--superseded the usual rapt communion very much in the manner of\r\n",
      "some beautiful tame tigress who might really coerce attention. There\r\n",
      "was in Mrs. Brookenham's way of looking up at her a dim despairing\r\n",
      "abandonment of the idea of any common personal ground. Lady Fanny,\r\n",
      "magnificent, simple, stupid, had almost the stature of her brother,\r\n",
      "a forehead unsurpassably low and an air of sombre concentration just\r\n",
      "sufficiently corrected by something in her movements that failed to give\r\n",
      "it a point. Her blue eyes were heavy in spite of being perhaps a couple\r\n",
      "of shades too clear, and the wealth of her black hair, the disposition\r\n",
      "of the massive coils of which was all her own, had possibly a satin\r\n",
      "sheen depreciated by the current fashion. But the great thing in her\r\n",
      "was that she was, with unconscious heroism, thoroughly herself; and\r\n",
      "what were Mrs. Brook and Mrs. Brook's intimates after all, in their free\r\n",
      "surrender to the play of perception, but a happy association for keeping\r\n",
      "her so? The Duchess was moved to the liveliest admiration by the grand\r\n",
      "simple sweetness of her encounter with Mrs. Donner, a combination indeed\r\n",
      "in which it was a question if she or Mrs. Brook appeared to the higher\r\n",
      "advantage. It was poor Mrs. Donner--not, like Mrs. Brook, subtle in\r\n",
      "sufficiency, nor, like Lady Fanny, almost too simple--who made the\r\n",
      "poorest show. The Duchess immediately marked it to Mitchy as infinitely\r\n",
      "characteristic that their hostess, instead of letting one of her\r\n",
      "visitors go, kept them together by some sweet ingenuity and while Lord\r\n",
      "Petherton, dropping his sister, joined Edward and Aggie in the other\r\n",
      "angle, sat there between them as if, in pursuance of some awfully clever\r\n",
      "line of her own, she were holding a hand of each. Mr. Mitchett of course\r\n",
      "did justice all round, or at least, as would have seemed from an enquiry\r\n",
      "he presently made, wished not to fail of it. \"Is it your real impression\r\n",
      "then that Lady Fanny has serious grounds--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For jealousy of that preposterous little person? My dear Mitchett,\" the\r\n",
      "Duchess resumed after a moment's reflexion, \"if you're so rash as to\r\n",
      "ask me in any of these connexions for my 'real' impression you deserve\r\n",
      "whatever you may get.\" The penalty Mitchy had incurred was apparently\r\n",
      "grave enough to make his companion just falter in the infliction of it;\r\n",
      "which gave him the opportunity of replying that the little person\r\n",
      "was perhaps not more preposterous than any one else, that there was\r\n",
      "something in her he rather liked, and that there were many different\r\n",
      "ways in which a woman could be interesting. This further levity it was\r\n",
      "therefore that laid him fully open. \"Do you mean to say you've\r\n",
      "been living with Petherton so long without becoming aware that he's\r\n",
      "shockingly worried?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear Duchess,\" Mitchy smiled, \"Petherton carries his worries with a\r\n",
      "bravery! They're so many that I've long since ceased to count them; and\r\n",
      "in general I've been disposed to let those pass that I can't help him to\r\n",
      "meet. YOU'VE made, I judge,\" he went on, \"a better use of opportunities\r\n",
      "perhaps not so good--such as at any rate enables you to see further than\r\n",
      "I into the meaning of the impatience he just now expressed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess was admirable, in conversation, for neglecting everything\r\n",
      "not essential to her present plausibility. \"A woman like Lady Fanny can\r\n",
      "have no 'grounds' for anything--for any indignation, I mean, or for any\r\n",
      "revenge worth twopence. In this particular case at all events they've\r\n",
      "been sacrificed with such extravagance that, as an injured wife, she\r\n",
      "hasn't had the gumption to keep back an inch or two to stand on. She can\r\n",

      "pulled up as at sight of a name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I take the view,\" said the Duchess, \"and I know exactly why. Elle se\r\n",

      "with--what shall I call it?--the absence of haunting remorse of a good\r\n",
      "house-mother who makes the family accounts balance. She looks--and it's\r\n",
      "what they love her for here when they say 'Watch her now!'--like an\r\n",
      "angry saint; but she's neither a saint nor, to be perfectly fair to her,\r\n",
      "really angry at all. She has only just enough reflexion to make out that\r\n",
      "it may some day be a little better for her that her husband shall, on\r\n",
      "his side too, have committed himself; and she's only, in secret, too\r\n",
      "pleased to be sure whom it has been with. All the same I must tell you,\"\r\n",
      "the Duchess still more crisply added, \"that our little friend Nanda is\r\n",
      "of the opinion--which I gather her to be quite ready to defend--that\r\n",
      "Lady Fanny's wrong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to do with it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What indeed, bless her heart? If you WILL ask questions, however, you\r\n",
      "must take, as I say, your risks. There are days when between you all you\r\n",
      "stupefy me. One of them was when I happened about a month ago to make\r\n",
      "some allusion to the charming example of Mr. Cashmore's fine taste that\r\n",
      "we have there before us: what was my surprise at the tone taken by Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook to deny on this little lady's behalf the soft impeachment? It\r\n",
      "was quite a mistake that anything had happened--Mrs. Donner had pulled\r\n",
      "through unscathed. She had been but a day or two at the most in danger,\r\n",
      "for her family and friends--the best influences--had rallied to her\r\n",
      "support: the flurry was all over. She was now perfectly safe. Do you\r\n",
      "think she looks so?\" the Duchess asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not a point that Mitchy was conscious of freedom of mind to\r\n",
      "examine. \"Do I understand you that Nanda was her mother's authority--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For the exact shade of the intimacy of the two friends and the state of\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook's information? Precisely--it was 'the latest before going to\r\n",
      "press.' 'Our own correspondent'! Her mother quoted her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mitchett visibly wondered. \"But how should Nanda know--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Anything about the matter? How should she NOT know everything? You've\r\n",
      "not, I suppose, lost sight of the fact that this lady and Mrs. Grendon\r\n",
      "are sisters. Carrie's situation and Carrie's perils are naturally very\r\n",
      "present to the extremely unoccupied Tishy, who is unhappily married into\r\n",
      "the bargain, who has no children, and whose house, as you may imagine,\r\n",
      "has a good thick atmosphere of partisanship. So, as with Nanda, on HER\r\n",
      "side, there's no more absorbing interest than her dear friend Tishy,\r\n",
      "with whom she's at present staying and under whose roof she perpetually\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I see the whole thing from here, you imply?\" Mr. Mitchett, under the\r\n",
      "influence of this rapid evocation, had already taken his line. \"Well,\"\r\n",
      "he said bravely, \"Nanda's not a fool.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A momentary silence on the part of the Duchess might have been her\r\n",
      "tribute to his courage. \"No. I don't agree with her, as it happens,\r\n",
      "here; but that there are matters as to which she's not in general at\r\n",
      "all befogged is exactly the worst I ever said of her. And I hold that in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"In the quarrel that a while back you sought to pick with me. What I\r\n",
      "touched on to her mother was the peculiar range of aspects and interests\r\n",
      "she's compelled to cultivate by the special intimacies that Mrs. Brook\r\n",
      "permits her. There they are--and that's all I said. Judge them for\r\n",
      "yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess had risen as she spoke, which was also what Mrs. Donner and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham had done; and Mr. Mitchett was on his feet as well, to\r\n",
      "act on this last admonition. Mrs. Donner was taking leave, and there\r\n",
      "occurred among the three ladies in connexion with the circumstance a\r\n",
      "somewhat striking exchange of endearments. Mr. Mitchett, observing this,\r\n",
      "expressed himself suddenly as diverted. \"By Jove, they're kissing--she's\r\n",
      "in Lady Fanny's arms!\" But his hilarity was still to deepen. \"And Lady\r\n",
      "Fanny, by Jove, is in Mrs. Brook's!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it's all beyond ME!\" the Duchess cried; and the little wail of her\r\n",
      "baffled imagination had almost the austerity of a complaint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not a bit--they're all right. Mrs. Brook has acted!\" Mitchy went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Donner's face presented, as she now crossed the room, something\r\n",
      "that resembled the ravage of a death-struggle between its artificial\r\n",
      "and its natural elegance. \"Well,\" Mitchy said with decision as he caught\r\n",
      "it--\"I back Nanda.\" And while a whiff of derision reached him from the\r\n",
      "Duchess, \"Nothing HAS happened!\" he murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to reward him for an indulgence that she must much more have divined\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The latter lady, at this, rested strange eyes on the speaker, and they\r\n",

      "just performed, had again subsided together while Mrs. Brook gazed up\r\n",
      "in exalted intelligence. \"It's a funny house,\" said the Duchess at last.\r\n",
      "\"She makes me such a scene over my not bringing Aggie, and still\r\n",
      "more over my very faint hint of my reasons for it, that I fly off,\r\n",
      "in compunction, to do what I can, on the spot, to repair my excess of\r\n",

      "talking with evident kindness and gaiety--a conjunction that evidently\r\n",
      "excited Mitchy's interest. \"May WE then know her?\" he asked with an\r\n",
      "effect of drollery. \"May I--if HE may?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess's eyes, turned to him, had taken another light. He even\r\n",
      "gaped a little at their expression, which was in a manner carried out by\r\n",
      "her tone. \"Go and talk to her, you perverse creature, and send him over\r\n",
      "to me.\" Lord Petherton, a minute later, had joined her; old Edward had\r\n",
      "left the room with Mrs. Donner; his wife and Lady Fanny were still more\r\n",
      "closely engaged; and the young Agnesina, though visibly a little scared\r\n",
      "at Mitchy's queer countenance, had begun, after the fashion he had\r\n",
      "touched on to Mrs. Brook, politely to invoke the aid of the idea of\r\n",
      "habit. \"Look here--you must help me,\" the Duchess said to Petherton.\r\n",
      "\"You can, perfectly--and it's the first thing I've yet asked of you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, oh, oh!\" her interlocutor laughed.\r\n",

      "of humour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mitchy too?\"--he appeared to wish to leave her in no doubt of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How low you are!\" she simply said. \"There are times when I despair of\r\n",
      "you. He's in every way your superior, and I like him so that--well, he\r\n",
      "must like HER. Make him feel that he does.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord Petherton turned it over as something put to him practically. \"I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "If Mitchy arrived exactly at the hour it was quite by design and on a\r\n",
      "calculation--over and above the prized little pleasure it might give\r\n",
      "him--of ten minutes clear with his host, whom it rarely befell him to\r\n",
      "see alone. He had a theory of something special to go into, of a\r\n",
      "plummet to sink or a feeler to put forth; his state of mind in short\r\n",
      "was diplomatic and anxious. But his hopes had a drop as he crossed\r\n",
      "the threshold. His precaution had only assured him the company of a\r\n",
      "stranger, for the person in the room to whom the servant announced\r\n",
      "him was not old Van. On the other hand this gentleman would clearly be\r\n",
      "old--what was it? the fellow Vanderbank had made it a matter of such\r\n",
      "importance he should \"really know.\" But were they then simply to have\r\n",
      "tea there together? No; the candidate for Mr. Mitchett's acquaintance,\r\n",
      "as if quickly guessing his apprehension, mentioned on the spot that\r\n",
      "their entertainer would be with them: he had just come home in a\r\n",
      "hurry, fearing he was late, and then had rushed off to make a change.\r\n",
      "\"Fortunately,\" said the speaker, who offered his explanation as if he\r\n",
      "had had it on his mind--\"fortunately the ladies haven't yet come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh there ARE to be ladies?\"--Mr. Mitchett was all response. His fellow\r\n",
      "guest, who was shy and apparently nervous, sidled about a little,\r\n",
      "swinging an eye-glass, yet glancing in a manner a trifle birdlike from\r\n",
      "object to object. \"Mrs. Edward Brookenham I think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" Mitchy himself felt, as soon as this comment had quitted his lips,\r\n",
      "that it might sound even to a stranger like a sign, such as the votaries\r\n",
      "of Mrs. Edward Brookenham had fallen into the way of constantly throwing\r\n",
      "off, that he recognised her hand in the matter. There was, however,\r\n",
      "something in his entertainer's face that somehow encouraged frankness;\r\n",
      "it had the sociability of surprise--it hadn't the chill. Mitchy saw\r\n",
      "at the same time that this friend of old Van's would never really\r\n",
      "understand him; though that was a thing he at times liked people as much\r\n",
      "for as he liked them little for it at others. It was in fact when he\r\n",
      "most liked that he was on the whole most tempted to mystify. \"Only Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook?--no others?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Mrs. Brook'?\" his elder echoed; staring an instant as if literally\r\n",
      "missing the connexion; but quickly after, to show he was not stupid--and\r\n",
      "indeed it seemed to show he was delightful--smiling with extravagant\r\n",
      "intelligence. \"Is that the right thing to say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy gave the kindest of laughs. \"Well, I dare say I oughtn't to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I didn't mean to correct you,\" his interlocutor hastened to profess;\r\n",
      "\"I meant on the contrary, will it be right for me too?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "His companion, as if to look at him with a due appreciation of this,\r\n",

      "pleasant way--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh we HAVE!\"--Mitchy, taking him up, was gaily emphatic. He began,\r\n",
      "however, already to perceive the mystification which in this case was to\r\n",
      "be his happy effect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Vanderbank,\" his victim remarked with perhaps a shade more of\r\n",
      "reserve, \"has told me a good deal about you.\" Then as if, in a finer\r\n",
      "manner, to keep the talk off themselves: \"He knows a great many ladies.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, poor chap, he can't help it. He finds a lady wherever he\r\n",
      "turns.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stranger took this in, but seemed a little to challenge it. \"Well,\r\n",
      "that's reassuring, if one sometimes fancies there are fewer.\"\r\n",

      "grinned and mused. \"I wonder.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, we shall see.\" His friend seemed to wish not to dogmatise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"SHALL we?\" Mitchy considered it again in its high suggestive light.\r\n",
      "\"You will--but how shall I?\" Then he caught himself up with a blush.\r\n",
      "\"What a beastly thing to say--as if it were mere years that make you see\r\n",
      "it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion this time gave way to the joke. \"What else can it be--if\r\n",
      "I've thought so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, it's the facts themselves, and the fine taste, and above all\r\n",
      "something qui ne court pas les rues, an approach to some experience of\r\n",
      "what a lady IS.\" The young man's acute reflexion appeared suddenly to\r\n",
      "flower into a vision of opportunity that swept everything else away.\r\n",
      "\"Excuse my insisting on your time of life--but you HAVE seen some?\" The\r\n",
      "question was of such interest that he had already begun to follow it.\r\n",
      "\"Oh the charm of talk with some one who can fill out one's idea of\r\n",
      "the really distinguished women of the past! If I could get you,\" he\r\n",
      "continued, \"to be so awfully valuable as to fill out mine!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "taking visibly his measure. \"Are you sure you've got an idea?\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett brightly thought. \"No. That must be just why I appeal to you.\r\n",
      "And it can't therefore be for confirmation, can it?\" he went on. \"It\r\n",
      "must be for the beautiful primary hint altogether.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His interlocutor began, with a shake of the eyeglass, to shift and sidle\r\n",
      "again, as if distinctly excited by the subject. But it was as if his\r\n",
      "very excitement made the poor gentleman a trifle coy. \"Are there no nice\r\n",
      "ones now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, there must be lots. In fact I know quantities.\"\r\n",

      "up to London, wondering, as you must, about what's happening--for\r\n",
      "Vanderbank mentioned, I think, that you HAVE come up--in pursuit of\r\n",
      "her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" laughed the subject of Vanderbank's information, \"I'm afraid\r\n",
      "'pursuit,' with me, is over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, you're at the age,\" Mitchy returned, \"of--the most exquisite form\r\n",
      "of it. Observation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yet it's a form, I seem to see, that you've not waited for my age\r\n",
      "to cultivate.\" This was followed by a decisive headshake. \"I'm not an\r\n",
      "observer. I'm a hater.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That only means,\" Mitchy explained, \"that you keep your observation for\r\n",
      "your likes--which is more admirable than prudent. But between my fear\r\n",
      "in the one direction and my desire in the other,\" he lightly added, \"I\r\n",
      "scarcely know how to present myself. I must study the ground. Meanwhile\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Old Van's possible confidant, instead of immediately answering, again\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"In general, I think--for shortness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And also\"--the speaker hesitated--\"for esteem?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy laughed out. \"For veneration! Our disrespects, I think, are\r\n",
      "all tender, and we wouldn't for the world do to a person we don't like\r\n",
      "anything so nice as to call him, or even to call her, don't you know--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "one to see you,\" Mitchy declared, \"as anything else, and on that footing\r\n",
      "you'll be, among us, unique.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon appeared to accept his prospect of isolation with a\r\n",
      "certain gravity. \"I gather from you--I've gathered indeed from Mr.\r\n",
      "Vanderbank--that you're a little sort of a set that hang very much\r\n",
      "together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes; not a formal association nor a secret society--still less a\r\n",
      "'dangerous gang' or an organisation for any definite end. We're simply\r\n",
      "a collection of natural affinities,\" Mitchy explained; \"meeting perhaps\r\n",
      "principally in Mrs. Brook's drawing-room--though sometimes also in old\r\n",
      "Van's, as you see, sometimes even in mine--and governed at any rate\r\n",
      "everywhere by Mrs. Brook, in our mysterious ebbs and flows, very much as\r\n",
      "the tides are governed by the moon. As I say,\" Mitchy pursued, \"you must\r\n",
      "join. But if Van has got hold of you,\" he added, \"or you've got hold of\r\n",
      "him, you HAVE joined. We're not quite so numerous as I could wish, and\r\n",
      "we want variety; we want just what I'm sure you'll bring us--a fresh\r\n",
      "eye, an outside mind.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon wore for a minute the air of a man knowing but too well what\r\n",
      "it was to be asked to put down his name. \"My friend Vanderbank swaggers\r\n",
      "so little that it's rather from you than from himself that I seem to\r\n",
      "catch the idea--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of his being a great figure among us? I don't know what he may have\r\n",
      "said to you or have suppressed; but you can take it from me--as between\r\n",
      "ourselves, you know--that he's very much the best of us. Old Van in\r\n",
      "fact--if you really want a candid opinion,\" and Mitchy shone still\r\n",
      "brighter as he talked, \"is formed for a distinctly higher sphere. I\r\n",
      "should go so far as to say that on our level he's positively wasted.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And are you very sure you're not?\" Mr. Longdon asked with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear no--I'm in my element. My element's to grovel before Van. You've\r\n",
      "only to look at me, as you must already have made out, to see I'm\r\n",
      "everything dreadful that he isn't. But you've seen him for yourself--I\r\n",
      "needn't tell you!\" Mitchy sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, as under the coercion of so much confidence, had stood in\r\n",
      "place longer than for any previous moment, and the spell continued for\r\n",
      "a minute after Mitchy had paused. Then nervously and abruptly he turned\r\n",
      "away, his friend watching him rather aimlessly wander. \"Our host has\r\n",
      "spoken of you to me in high terms,\" he said as he came back. \"You'd have\r\n",
      "no fault to find with them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy took it with his highest light. \"I know from your taking the\r\n",
      "trouble to remember that, how much what I've said of him pleases and\r\n",
      "touches you. We're a little sort of religion then, you and I; we're\r\n",
      "an organisation of two, at any rate, and we can't help ourselves.\r\n",
      "There--that's settled.\" He glanced at the clock on the chimney. \"But\r\n",
      "what's the matter with him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You gentlemen dress so much,\" said Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy met the explanation quite halfway. \"_I_ try to look funny--but\r\n",
      "why should Apollo in person?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon weighed it. \"Do you think him like Apollo?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The very image. Ask any of the women!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But do _I_ know--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How Apollo must look?\" Mitchy considered. \"Why the way it works is that\r\n",
      "it's just from Van's appearance they get the tip, and that then, don't\r\n",
      "you see? they've their term of comparison. Isn't it what you call a\r\n",
      "vicious circle? I borrow a little their vice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, who had once more been arrested, once more sidled away.\r\n",
      "Then he spoke from the other side of the expanse of a table covered with\r\n",
      "books for which the shelves had no space--covered with portfolios, with\r\n",
      "well-worn leather-cased boxes, with documents in neat piles. The place\r\n",
      "was a miscellany, yet not a litter, the picture of an admirable order.\r\n",
      "\"If we're a fond association of two, you and I, let me, accepting your\r\n",
      "idea, do what, this way, under a gentleman's roof and while enjoying his\r\n",
      "hospitality, I should in ordinary circumstances think perhaps something\r\n",
      "of a breach.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh strike out!\" Mitchy laughed. It possibly chilled his interlocutor,\r\n",
      "who again hung fire so long that he himself at last adopted his image.\r\n",
      "\"Why doesn't he marry, you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon fairly flushed with recognition. \"You're very deep, but with\r\n",
      "what we perceive--why doesn't he?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy continued visibly to have his amusement, which might have been,\r\n",
      "this time and in spite of the amalgamation he had pictured, for what\r\n",
      "\"they\" perceived. But he threw off after an instant an answer clearly\r\n",
      "intended to meet the case. \"He thinks he hasn't the means. He has great\r\n",
      "ideas of what a fellow must offer a woman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's eyes travelled a while over the amenities about him. \"He\r\n",
      "hasn't such a view of himself alone--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As to make him think he's enough as he stands? No,\" said Mitchy, \"I\r\n",
      "don't fancy he has a very awful view of himself alone. And since we ARE\r\n",
      "burning this incense under his nose,\" he added, \"it's also my impression\r\n",
      "that he has no private means. Women in London cost so much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had a pause. \"They come very high, I dare say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh tremendously. They want so much--they want everything. I mean the\r\n",
      "sort of women he lives with. A modest man--who's also poor--isn't in\r\n",
      "it. I give you that at any rate as his view. There are lots of them that\r\n",
      "would---and only too glad--'love him for himself'; but things are much\r\n",
      "mixed, and these not necessarily the right ones, and at all events he\r\n",
      "doesn't see it. The result of which is that he's waiting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Waiting to feel himself in love?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy just hesitated. \"Well, we're talking of marriage. Of course\r\n",
      "you'll say there are women with money. There ARE\"--he seemed for a\r\n",
      "moment to meditate--\"dreadful ones!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two men, on this, exchanged a long regard. \"He mustn't do that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy again hesitated. \"He won't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had also a silence, which he presently terminated by one of\r\n",
      "his jerks into motion. \"He shan't!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more Mitchy watched him revolve a little, but now, familiarly yet\r\n",
      "with a sharp emphasis, he himself resumed their colloquy. \"See here, Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon. Are you seriously taking him up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet again, at the tone of this appeal, the old man perceptibly coloured.\r\n",
      "It was as if his friend had brought to the surface an inward excitement,\r\n",
      "and he laughed for embarrassment. \"You see things with a freedom--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and it's so I express them. I see them, I know, with a raccourci;\r\n",
      "but time after all rather presses, and at any rate we understand\r\n",
      "each other. What I want now is just to say\"--and Mitchy spoke with a\r\n",
      "simplicity and a gravity he had not yet used--\"that if your interest in\r\n",
      "him should at any time reach the point of your wishing to do something\r\n",
      "or other (no matter what, don't you see?) FOR him--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, as he faltered, appeared to wonder, but emitted a sound of\r\n",
      "gentleness. \"Yes?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why,\" said the stimulated Mitchy, \"do, for God's sake, just let me have\r\n",
      "a finger in it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's momentary mystification was perhaps partly but the natural\r\n",
      "effect of constitutional prudence. \"A finger?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean--let me help.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" breathed the old man thoughtfully and without meeting his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, as if with more to say, watched him an instant, then before\r\n",
      "speaking caught himself up. \"Look out--here he comes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hearing the stir of the door by which he had entered he looked round;\r\n",
      "but it opened at first only to admit Vanderbank's servant. \"Miss\r\n",
      "Brookenham!\" the man announced; on which the two gentlemen in the room\r\n",
      "were--audibly, almost violently--precipitated into a union of surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However she might have been discussed Nanda was not one to shrink, for,\r\n",
      "though she drew up an instant on failing to find in the room the person\r\n",
      "whose invitation she had obeyed, she advanced the next moment as if\r\n",
      "either of the gentlemen before her would answer as well. \"How do you\r\n",
      "do, Mr. Mitchy? How do you do, Mr. Longdon?\" She made no difference for\r\n",
      "them, speaking to the elder, whom she had not yet seen, as if they were\r\n",
      "already acquainted. There was moreover in the air of that personage at\r\n",
      "this juncture little to invite such a confidence: he appeared to have\r\n",
      "been startled, in the oddest manner, into stillness and, holding out\r\n",
      "no hand to meet her, only stared rather stiffly and without a smile. An\r\n",
      "observer disposed to interpret the scene might have fancied him a trifle\r\n",
      "put off by the girl's familiarity, or even, as by a singular effect\r\n",
      "of her self-possession, stricken into deeper diffidence. This\r\n",
      "self-possession, however, took on her own part no account of any\r\n",
      "awkwardness: it seemed the greater from the fact that she was almost\r\n",
      "unnaturally grave, and it overflowed in the immediate challenge: \"Do you\r\n",
      "mean to say Van isn't here? I've come without mother--she said I could,\r\n",
      "to see HIM,\" she went on, addressing herself more particularly to\r\n",
      "Mitchy. \"But she didn't say I might do anything of that sort to see\r\n",
      "YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If there was something serious in Nanda and something blank in their\r\n",
      "companion, there was, superficially at least, nothing in Mr. Mitchett\r\n",
      "but his usual flush of gaiety. \"Did she really send you off this way\r\n",
      "alone?\" Then while the girl's face met his own with the clear confession\r\n",
      "of it: \"Isn't she too splendid for anything?\" he asked with immense\r\n",
      "enjoyment. \"What do you suppose is her idea?\" Nanda's eyes had now\r\n",
      "turned to Mr. Longdon, whom she fixed with her mild straightness; which\r\n",
      "led to Mitchy's carrying on and repeating the appeal. \"Isn't Mrs. Brook\r\n",
      "charming? What do you suppose is her idea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a bound into the mystery, a bound of which his fellow visitor\r\n",
      "stood quite unconscious, only looking at Nanda still with the same\r\n",
      "coldness of wonder. All expression had for the minute been arrested\r\n",
      "in Mr. Longdon, but he at last began to show that it had merely been\r\n",
      "retarded. Yet it was almost with solemnity that he put forth his hand.\r\n",
      "\"How do you do? How do you do? I'm so glad!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda shook hands with him as if she had done so already, though it\r\n",
      "might have been just her look of curiosity that detracted from her air\r\n",
      "of amusing herself. \"Mother has wanted me awfully to see you. She told\r\n",
      "me to give you her love,\" she said. Then she added with odd irrelevance:\r\n",
      "\"I didn't come in the carriage, nor in a cab nor an omnibus.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You came on a bicycle?\" Mitchy enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I walked.\" She still spoke without a gleam. \"Mother wants me to do\r\n",
      "everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Even to walk!\" Mitchy laughed. \"Oh yes, we must in these times keep up\r\n",
      "our walking!\" The ingenious observer just now suggested might even have\r\n",
      "detected in the still higher rise of this visitor's spirits a want of\r\n",
      "mere inward ease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had taken no notice of the effect upon him of her mention of her\r\n",
      "mother, and she took none, visibly, of Mr. Longdon's manner or of his\r\n",
      "words. What she did while the two men, without offering her, either, a\r\n",
      "seat, practically lost themselves in their deepening vision, was to give\r\n",
      "her attention all to the place, looking at the books, pictures and other\r\n",
      "significant objects, and especially at the small table set out for tea,\r\n",
      "to which the servant who had admitted her now returned with a steaming\r\n",
      "kettle. \"Isn't it charming here? Will there be any one else? Where IS\r\n",
      "Mr. Van? Shall I make tea?\" There was just a faint quaver, showing a\r\n",
      "command of the situation more desired perhaps than achieved, in the very\r\n",
      "rapid sequence of these ejaculations. The servant meanwhile had placed\r\n",
      "the hot water above the little silver lamp and left the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you suppose there's anything the matter? Oughtn't the man--or do you\r\n",
      "know our host's room?\" Mr. Longdon, addressing Mitchy with solicitude,\r\n",
      "yet began to show in a countenance less blank a return of his sense of\r\n",
      "relations. It was as if something had happened to him and he were in\r\n",
      "haste to convert the signs of it into an appearance of care for the\r\n",
      "proprieties.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Mitchy, \"Van's only making himself beautiful\"--which account\r\n",
      "of their absent entertainer gained a point from his appearance at the\r\n",
      "moment in the doorway furthest removed from the place where the three\r\n",
      "were gathered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank came in with friendly haste and with something of the\r\n",
      "look indeed--refreshed, almost rosy, brightly brushed and quickly\r\n",
      "buttoned--of emerging, out of breath, from pleasant ablutions and\r\n",
      "renewals. \"What a brute to have kept you waiting! I came back from work\r\n",
      "quite begrimed. How d'ye do, how d'ye do, how d'ye do? What's the matter\r\n",
      "with you, huddled there as if you were on a street-crossing? I want you\r\n",
      "to think this a refuge--but not of that kind!\" he laughed. \"Sit\r\n",
      "down, for heaven's sake; lie down--be happy! Of course you've made\r\n",
      "acquaintance all--except that Mitchy's so modest! Tea, tea!\"--and he\r\n",
      "bustled to the table, where the next minute he appeared rather helpless.\r\n",
      "\"Nanda, you blessed child, do YOU mind making it? How jolly of you!--are\r\n",
      "you all right?\" He seemed, with this, for the first time, to be aware of\r\n",
      "somebody's absence. \"Your mother isn't coming? She let you come alone?\r\n",
      "How jolly of her!\" Pulling off her gloves Nanda had come immediately\r\n",
      "to his assistance; on which, quitting the table and laying hands on Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon's shoulder to push him toward a sofa, he continued to talk, to\r\n",
      "sound a note of which the humour was the exaggeration of his flurry.\r\n",
      "\"How jolly of you to be willing to come--most awfully kind! I hope she\r\n",
      "isn't ill? Do, Mitchy, lie down. Down, Mitchy, down!--that's the only\r\n",
      "way to keep you.\" He had waited for no account of Mrs. Brookenham's\r\n",
      "health, and it might have been apparent--still to our sharp\r\n",
      "spectator--that he found nothing wonderful in her daughter's unsupported\r\n",
      "arrival.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can make tea beautifully,\" she said from behind her table. \"Mother\r\n",
      "showed me how this morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This morning?\"--and Mitchy, who, before the fire and still erect,\r\n",
      "had declined to be laid low, greeted the simple remark with uproarious\r\n",
      "mirth. \"Dear young lady, you're the most delicious family!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She showed me at breakfast about the little things to do. She thought\r\n",
      "I might have to make it here and told me to offer,\" the girl went on.\r\n",
      "\"I haven't yet done it this way at home--I usually have my tea upstairs.\r\n",
      "They bring it up in a cup, all made and very weak, with a piece of\r\n",
      "bread-and-butter in the saucer. That's because I'm so young. Tishy never\r\n",
      "lets me touch hers either; so we had to make up for lost time. That's\r\n",
      "what mother said\"--she followed up her story, and her young distinctness\r\n",
      "had clearly something to do with a certain pale concentration in Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon's face. \"Mother isn't ill, but she told me already yesterday\r\n",
      "she wouldn't come. She said it's really all for ME. I'm sure I hope it\r\n",
      "is!\"--with which there flickered in her eyes, dimly but perhaps all\r\n",
      "the more prettily, the first intimation they had given of the light of\r\n",
      "laughter. \"She told me you'd understand, Mr. Van--from something you've\r\n",
      "said to her. It's for my seeing Mr. Longdon without--she thinks--her\r\n",
      "spoiling it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh my dear child, 'spoiling it'!\" Vanderbank protested as he took a\r\n",
      "cup of tea from her to carry to their friend. \"When did your mother ever\r\n",
      "spoil anything? I told her Mr. Longdon wanted to see you, but I didn't\r\n",
      "say anything of his not yearning also for the rest of the family.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A sound of protest rather formless escaped from the gentleman named, but\r\n",
      "Nanda continued to carry out her duty. \"She told me to ask why he hadn't\r\n",
      "been again to see her. Mr. Mitchy, sugar?--isn't that the way to say it?\r\n",
      "Three lumps? You're like me, only that I more often take five.\" Mitchy\r\n",
      "had dashed forward for his tea; she gave it to him; then she added with\r\n",
      "her eyes on Mr. Longdon's, which she had had no difficulty in catching:\r\n",
      "\"She told me to ask you all sorts of things.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This acquaintance had got up to take his cup from Vanderbank, whose\r\n",
      "hand, however, dealt with him on the question of his sitting down again.\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, resisting, kept erect with a low gasp that his host\r\n",
      "only was near enough to catch. This suddenly appeared to confirm an\r\n",
      "impression gathered by Vanderbank in their contact, a strange sense that\r\n",
      "his visitor was so agitated as to be trembling in every limb. It brought\r\n",
      "to his own lips a kind of ejaculation--\"I SAY!\" But even as he spoke\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's face, still white, but with a smile that was not all pain,\r\n",
      "seemed to supplicate him not to notice; and he was not a man to require\r\n",
      "more than this to achieve a divination as deep as it was rapid. \"Why\r\n",
      "we've all been scattered for Easter, haven't we?\" he asked of Nanda.\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Longdon has been at home, your mother and father have been paying\r\n",
      "visits, I myself have been out of London, Mitchy has been to Paris, and\r\n",
      "you--oh yes, I know where you've been.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah we all know that--there has been such a row made about it!\" Mitchy\r\n",
      "said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I've heard of the feeling there is,\" Nanda replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, with Vanderbank's covert aid, had begun to appear to have\r\n",
      "pulled himself together, dropping back on his sofa and attending in a\r\n",
      "manner to his tea. It might have been with the notion of showing himself\r\n",
      "at ease that he turned, on this, a benevolent smile to the girl. \"But\r\n",
      "what, my dear, is the objection--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked gravely from him to Vanderbank and to Mitchy, and then back\r\n",
      "again from one of these to the other. \"Do you think I ought to say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They both laughed and they both just appeared uncertain, but Vanderbank\r\n",
      "spoke first. \"I don't imagine, Nanda, that you really know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--as a family, you're perfection!\" Mitchy broke out. Before the fire\r\n",
      "again, with his cup, he addressed his hilarity to Mr. Longdon. \"I told\r\n",
      "you a tremendous lot, didn't I? But I didn't tell you about that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His elder maintained, yet with a certain vagueness, the attitude of\r\n",
      "amiable enquiry. \"About the--a--family?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Mitchy smiled, \"about its ramifications. This young lady has a\r\n",
      "tremendous friendship--and in short it's all very complicated.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear Nanda,\" said Vanderbank, \"it's all very simple. Don't believe a\r\n",
      "word of anything of the sort.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had spoken as with the intention of a large vague optimism; but there\r\n",
      "was plainly something in the girl that would always make for lucidity.\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean about Carrie Donner? I DON'T believe it, and at any rate\r\n",
      "I don't think it's any one's business. I shouldn't have a very high\r\n",
      "opinion of a person who would give up a friend.\" She stopped short with\r\n",
      "the sense apparent that she was saying more than she meant, though,\r\n",
      "strangely, as if it had been an effect of her type and of her voice,\r\n",
      "there was neither pertness nor passion in the profession she had just\r\n",
      "made. Curiously wanting as she seemed both in timidity and in levity,\r\n",
      "she was to a certainty not self-conscious--she was extraordinarily\r\n",
      "simple. Mr. Longdon looked at her now with an evident surrender to his\r\n",
      "extreme interest, and it might well have perplexed him to see her at\r\n",
      "once so downright as from experience and yet of so fresh and sweet a\r\n",
      "tenderness of youth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's right, that's right, my dear young lady: never, never give up a\r\n",
      "friend for anything any one says!\" It was Mitchy who rang out with this\r\n",
      "lively wisdom, the action of which on Mr. Longdon--unless indeed it was\r\n",
      "the action of something else--was to make that personage, in a manner\r\n",
      "that held the others watching him in slight suspense, suddenly spring to\r\n",
      "his feet again, put down his teacup carefully on a table near and then\r\n",
      "without a word, as if no one had been present, quietly wander away and\r\n",
      "disappear through the door left open on Vanderbank's entrance. It\r\n",
      "opened into a second, a smaller sitting-room, into which the eyes of his\r\n",
      "companions followed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" Nanda asked. \"Has he been taken ill?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He IS 'rum,' my dear Van,\" Mitchy said; \"but you're right--of a charm,\r\n",
      "a distinction! In short just the sort of thing we want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The sort of thing we 'want'--I dare say!\" Vanderbank laughed. \"But it's\r\n",
      "not the sort of thing that's to be had for the asking--it's a sort we\r\n",
      "shall be mighty lucky if we can get!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy turned with amusement to Nanda. \"Van has invented him and, with\r\n",
      "the natural greed of the inventor, won't let us have him cheap. Well,\"\r\n",
      "he went on, \"I'll 'stand' my share.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The difficulty is that he's so much too good for us,\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ungrateful wretch,\" his friend cried, \"that's just what I've been\r\n",
      "telling him that YOU are! Let the return you make not be to deprive\r\n",
      "me--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Van's not at all too good for ME, if you mean that,\" Nanda broke\r\n",
      "in. She had finished her tea-making and leaned back in her chair with\r\n",
      "her hands folded on the edge of the tray.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank only smiled at her in silence, but Mitchy took it up.\r\n",
      "\"There's nobody too good for you, of course; only you're not quite,\r\n",
      "don't you know? IN our set. You're in Mrs. Grendon's. I know what you're\r\n",
      "going to say--that she hasn't got any set, that she's just a loose\r\n",
      "little white flower dropped on the indifferent bosom of the world. But\r\n",
      "you're the small sprig of tender green that, added to her, makes her\r\n",
      "immediately 'compose.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda looked at him with her cold kindness. \"What nonsense you do talk!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your tone's sweet to me,\" he returned, \"as showing that you don't think\r\n",
      "ME, either, too good for you. No one, remember, will take that for your\r\n",
      "excuse when the world some day sees me annihilated by your having put an\r\n",
      "end to our so harmless relations.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl appeared to lose herself a moment in the--abysmal humanity over\r\n",
      "which his fairly fascinating ugliness played like the whirl of an eddy.\r\n",
      "\"Martyr!\" she gently exclaimed. But there was no smile with it. She\r\n",
      "turned to Vanderbank, who, during the previous minute, had moved toward\r\n",
      "the neighbouring room, then faltering, taking counsel of discretion, had\r\n",
      "come back on a scruple. \"What IS the matter?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you want to get out of him, you wretch?\" Mitchy went on as\r\n",
      "their host for an instant said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, whose handsome face had a fine thought in it, looked a\r\n",
      "trifle absently from one of them to the other; but it was to Nanda he\r\n",
      "spoke. \"Do you like him, Nanda?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She showed surprise at the question. \"How can I know so soon?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"HE knows already.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, with his eyes on her, became radiant to interpret. \"He knows\r\n",
      "that he's pierced to the heart!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The matter with him, as you call it,\" Vanderbank brought out, \"is one\r\n",
      "of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.\" He looked at her as with a\r\n",
      "hope she'd understand. \"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Precisely,\" Mitchy continued; \"the victim done for by one glance of the\r\n",
      "goddess!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda, motionless in her chair, fixed her other friend with clear\r\n",
      "curiosity. \"'Beautiful'? Why beautiful?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, about to speak, checked himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I won't spoil it. Have it from HIM!\"--and, returning to their friend,\r\n",
      "he this time went out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy and Nanda looked at each other. \"But isn't it rather awful?\"\r\n",
      "Mitchy demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She got up without answering; she slowly came away from the table. \"I\r\n",
      "think I do know if I like him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well you may,\" Mitchy exclaimed, \"after his putting before you\r\n",
      "probably, on the whole, the greatest of your triumphs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I also know, I think, Mr. Mitchy, that I like YOU.\" She spoke\r\n",
      "without attention to this hyperbole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In spite of my ineffectual attempts to be brilliant? That's a joy,\" he\r\n",
      "went on, \"if it's not drawn out by the mere clumsiness of my flattery.\"\r\n",
      "She had turned away from him, kindly enough, as if time for his talk in\r\n",
      "the air were always to be allowed him: she took in vaguely Vanderbank's\r\n",
      "books and prints. \"Why didn't your mother come?\" Mitchy then enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this she again looked at him. \"Do you mention her as a way of\r\n",
      "alluding to something you guess she must have told me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I've always supposed I make your flesh creep? Yes,\" Mitchy\r\n",
      "admitted; \"I see she must have said to you: 'Be nice to him, to show him\r\n",
      "it isn't quite so bad as that!' So you ARE nice--so you always WILL be\r\n",
      "nice. But I adore you, all the same, without illusions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had opened at one of the tables, unperceivingly, a big volume of\r\n",
      "which she turned the leaves. \"Don't 'adore' a girl, Mr. Mitchy--just\r\n",
      "help her. That's more to the purpose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Help you?\" he cried. \"You bring tears to my eyes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can't a girl have friends?\" she went on. \"I never heard of anything\r\n",
      "so idiotic.\" Giving him, however, no chance to take her up on this, she\r\n",
      "made a quick transition. \"Mother didn't come because she wants me now,\r\n",
      "as she says, more to share her own life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy looked at it. \"But is this the way for her to share yours?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah that's another matter--about which you must talk to HER. She wants\r\n",
      "me no longer to keep seeing only with her eyes. She's throwing me into\r\n",
      "the world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy had listened with the liveliest interest, but he presently broke\r\n",
      "into a laugh. \"What a good thing then that I'm there to catch you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without--it might have been seen--having gathered the smallest\r\n",
      "impression of what they enclosed, she carefully drew together again the\r\n",
      "covers of her folio. There was deliberation in her movements. \"I shall\r\n",
      "always be glad when you're there. But where do you suppose they've\r\n",
      "gone?\" Her eyes were on what was visible of the other room, from which\r\n",
      "there arrived no sound of voices.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're off there,\" said Mitchy, \"but just looking unutterable things\r\n",
      "about you. The impression's too deep. Let them look, and tell me\r\n",
      "meanwhile if Mrs. Donner gave you my message.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, she told me some humbug.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The humbug then was in the tone my perfectly sincere speech took from\r\n",
      "herself. She gives things, I recognise, rather that sound. It's her\r\n",
      "weakness,\" he continued, \"and perhaps even one may say her danger. All\r\n",
      "the more reason you should help her, as I believe you're supposed to be\r\n",
      "doing, aren't you? I hope you feel you are,\" he earnestly added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had spoken this time gravely enough, and with magnificent gravity\r\n",
      "Nanda replied. \"I HAVE helped her. Tishy's sure I have. That's what\r\n",
      "Tishy wants me for. She says that to be with some nice girl's really the\r\n",
      "best thing for her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Mitchy's face hereupon would have been interesting, would have been\r\n",
      "distinctly touching to other eyes; but Nanda's were not heedful of it.\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he returned after an instant and without profane mirth, \"that\r\n",
      "seems to me the best thing for any one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, however, might have caught his expression, for Vanderbank\r\n",
      "now reappeared, smiling on the pair as if struck by their intimacy. \"How\r\n",
      "you ARE keeping it up!\" Then to Nanda persuasively: \"Do you mind going\r\n",
      "to him in there? I want him so really to see you. It's quite, you know,\r\n",
      "what he came for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda seemed to wonder. \"What will he do to me? Anything dreadful?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll tell you what I meant just now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Nanda, \"if he's a person who can tell me sometimes what you\r\n",
      "mean--!\" With which she went quickly off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And can't _I_ hear?\" Mitchy asked of his host while they looked after\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but only from me.\" Vanderbank had pushed him to a seat again and\r\n",
      "was casting about for cigarettes. \"Be quiet and smoke, and I'll tell\r\n",
      "you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, on the sofa, received with meditation a light. \"Will she\r\n",
      "understand? She has everything in the world but one,\" he added. \"But\r\n",
      "that's half.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, before him, lighted for himself. \"What is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A sense of humour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, she's serious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy smoked a little. \"She's tragic.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend, at the fire, watched a moment the empty portion of the other\r\n",
      "room, then walked across to give the door a light push that all but\r\n",
      "closed it. \"It's rather odd,\" he remarked as he came back--\"that's quite\r\n",
      "what I just said to him. But he won't treat her to comedy.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it the shock of the resemblance to her grandmother?\" Vanderbank had\r\n",
      "asked of Mr. Longdon on rejoining him in his retreat. This victim of\r\n",
      "memory, with his back turned, was gazing out of the window, and when in\r\n",
      "answer he showed his face there were tears in his eyes. His answer\r\n",
      "in fact was just these tears, the significance of which Vanderbank\r\n",
      "immediately recognised. \"It's still greater then than you gathered from\r\n",
      "her photograph?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's the most extraordinary thing in the world. I'm too absurd to be so\r\n",
      "upset\"--Mr. Longdon smiled through his tears--\"but if you had known\r\n",
      "Lady Julia you'd understand. It's SHE again, as I first knew her, to the\r\n",
      "life; and not only in feature, in stature, in colour, in movement, but\r\n",
      "in every bodily mark and sign, in every look of the eyes above all--oh\r\n",
      "to a degree!--in the sound, in the charm of the voice.\" He spoke low and\r\n",
      "confidentially, but with an intensity that now relieved him--he was as\r\n",
      "restless as with a discovery. He moved about as with a sacred awe--he\r\n",
      "might a few steps away have been in the very presence. \"She's ALL Lady\r\n",
      "Julia. There isn't a touch of her mother. It's unique--an absolute\r\n",
      "revival. I see nothing of her father, I see nothing of any one else.\r\n",
      "Isn't it thought wonderful by every one?\" he went on. \"Why didn't you\r\n",
      "tell me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To have prepared you a little?\"--Vanderbank felt almost guilty. \"I\r\n",
      "see--I should have liked to make more of it; though,\" he added all\r\n",
      "lucidly, \"I might so, by putting you on your guard, have caused myself\r\n",
      "to lose what, if you'll allow me to say it, strikes me as one of the\r\n",
      "most touching tributes I've ever seen rendered to a woman. In fact,\r\n",
      "however, how could I know? I never saw Lady Julia, and you had in\r\n",
      "advance all the evidence I could have: the portrait--pretty bad, in the\r\n",
      "taste of the time, I admit--and the three or four photographs you must\r\n",
      "have noticed with it at Mrs. Brook's. These things must have compared\r\n",
      "themselves for you with my photograph in there of the granddaughter.\r\n",
      "The similarity of course we had all observed, but it has taken your\r\n",
      "wonderful memory and your happy vision to put into it all the detail.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon thought a moment, giving a dab with his pocket-handkerchief.\r\n",
      "\"Very true--you're quite right. It's far beyond any identity in the\r\n",
      "pictures. But why did you tell me,\" he added more sharply, \"that she\r\n",
      "isn't beautiful?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've deprived me,\" Vanderbank laughed, \"of the power of expressing\r\n",
      "civilly any surprise at your finding her so. But I said to you, please\r\n",
      "remember, nothing that qualified a jot my sense of the special stamp of\r\n",
      "her face. I've always positively found in it a recall of the type of the\r\n",
      "period you must be thinking of. It isn't a bit modern. It's a face of\r\n",
      "Sir Thomas Lawrence--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a face of Gainsborough!\" Mr. Longdon returned with spirit. \"Lady\r\n",
      "Julia herself harked back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, clearly, was equally touched and amused. \"Let us say at once\r\n",
      "that it's a face of Raphael.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His old friend's hand was instantly on his arm. \"That's exactly what I\r\n",
      "often said to myself of Lady Julia's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The forehead's a little too high,\" said Vanderbank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it's just that excess that, with the exquisite eyes and the\r\n",
      "particular disposition round it of the fair hair, makes the individual\r\n",
      "grace, makes the beauty of the resemblance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Released by Lady Julia's lover, the young man in turn grasped him as\r\n",
      "an encouragement to confidence. \"It's a face that should have the\r\n",
      "long side-ringlets of 1830. It should have the rest of the personal\r\n",
      "arrangement, the pelisse, the shape of bonnet, the sprigged muslin\r\n",
      "dress and the cross-laced sandals. It should have arrived in a pea-green\r\n",
      "'tilbury' and be a reader of Mrs. Radcliffe. And all this to complete\r\n",
      "the Raphael!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, who, his discovery proclaimed, had begun, as might have\r\n",
      "been said, to live with it, looked hard a moment at his companion. \"How\r\n",
      "you've observed her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank met it without confusion. \"Whom haven't I observed? Do you\r\n",
      "like her?\" he then rather oddly and abruptly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man broke away again. \"How can I tell--with such disparities?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The manner must be different,\" Vanderbank suggested. \"And the things\r\n",
      "she says.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His visitor was before him again. \"I don't know what to make of them.\r\n",
      "They don't go with the rest of her. Lady Julia,\" said Mr. Longdon, \"was\r\n",
      "rather shy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this too his host could meet him. \"She must have been. And\r\n",
      "Nanda--yes, certainly--doesn't give that impression.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the contrary. But Lady Julia was gay!\" he added with an eagerness\r\n",
      "that made Vanderbank smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can also see that. Nanda doesn't joke. And yet,\" Vanderbank continued\r\n",
      "with his exemplary candour, \"we mustn't speak of her, must we? as if she\r\n",
      "were bold and grim.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon fixed him. \"Do you think she's sad?\"\r\n",

      "They had preserved their lowered tone and might, with their heads\r\n",
      "together, have been conferring as the party \"out\" in some game with the\r\n",
      "couple in the other room. \"Yes. Sad.\" But Vanderbank broke off. \"I'll\r\n",
      "send her to you.\" Thus it was he had come back to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda, on joining the elder man, went straight to the point. \"He says\r\n",
      "it's so beautiful--what you feel on seeing me: if that IS what he\r\n",
      "meant.\" Mr. Longdon kept silent again at first, only smiling at her, but\r\n",
      "less strangely now, and then appeared to look about him for some place\r\n",
      "where she could sit near him. There was a sofa in this room too, on\r\n",
      "which, observing it, she quickly sank down, so that they were presently\r\n",
      "together, placed a little sideways and face to face. She had shown\r\n",
      "perhaps that she supposed him to have wished to take her hand, but he\r\n",
      "forbore to touch her, though letting her feel all the kindness of his\r\n",
      "eyes and their long backward vision. These things she evidently felt\r\n",
      "soon enough; she went on before he had spoken. \"I know how well you knew\r\n",
      "my grandmother. Mother has told me--and I'm so glad. She told me to say\r\n",
      "to you that she wants YOU to tell me.\" Just a shade, at this, might have\r\n",
      "appeared to drop over his face, but who was there to know if the girl\r\n",
      "observed it? It didn't prevent at any rate her completing her statement.\r\n",
      "\"That's why she wished me to-day to come alone. She said she wished you\r\n",
      "to have me all to yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No, decidedly, she wasn't shy: that mute reflexion was in the air an\r\n",
      "instant. \"That, no doubt, is the best way. I thank her very much. I\r\n",
      "called, after having had the honour of dining--I called, I think, three\r\n",
      "times,\" he went on with a sudden displacement of the question; \"but I\r\n",
      "had the misfortune each time to miss her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She kept looking at him with her crude young clearness. \"I didn't know\r\n",
      "about that. Mother thinks she's more at home than almost any one.\r\n",
      "She does it on purpose: she knows what it is,\" Nanda pursued with her\r\n",
      "perfect gravity, \"for people to be disappointed of finding her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I shall find her yet,\" said Mr. Longdon. \"And then I hope I shall\r\n",
      "also find YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She appeared simply to consider the possibility and after an instant to\r\n",
      "think well of it. \"I dare say you will now, for now I shall be down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion just blinked. \"In the drawing-room, you mean--always?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was quite what she meant. \"Always. I shall see all the people who\r\n",
      "come. It will be a great thing for me. I want to hear all the talk. Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett says I ought to--that it helps to form the young mind. I hoped,\r\n",
      "for that reason,\" she went on with the directness that made her honesty\r\n",
      "almost violent--\"I hoped there would be more people here to-day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm very glad there are not!\"--the old man rang equally clear. \"Mr.\r\n",
      "Vanderbank kindly arranged the matter for me just this way. I met him at\r\n",
      "dinner, at your mother's, three weeks ago, and he brought me home here\r\n",
      "that night, when, as knowing you so differently, we took the liberty of\r\n",
      "talking you all over. It naturally had the effect of making me want to\r\n",
      "begin with you afresh--only that seemed difficult too without further\r\n",
      "help. This he good-naturedly offered me; he said\"--and Mr. Longdon\r\n",
      "recovered his spirits to repeat it--\"'Hang it, I'll have 'em here for\r\n",
      "you!'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see--he knew we'd come.\" Then she caught herself up. \"But we haven't\r\n",
      "come, have we?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it's all right--it's all right. To me the occasion's brilliant and\r\n",
      "the affluence great. I've had such talk with those young men--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see\"--she was again prompt, but beyond any young person he had ever\r\n",
      "met she might have struck him as literal. \"You're not used to such talk.\r\n",
      "Neither am I. It's rather wonderful, isn't it? They're thought awfully\r\n",
      "clever, Mr. Van and Mr. Mitchy. Do you like them?\" she pushed on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, who, as compared with her, might have struck a spectator\r\n",
      "as infernally subtle, took an instant to think. \"I've never met Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett before.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, he always thinks one doesn't like him,\" Nanda explained. \"But one\r\n",
      "does. One ought to,\" she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion had another pause. \"He likes YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh Mr. Longdon needn't have hesitated! \"I know he does. He has told\r\n",
      "mother. He has told lots of people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has told even you,\" Mr. Longdon smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--but that isn't the same. I don't think he's a bit dreadful,\" she\r\n",
      "pursued. Still, there was a greater interest. \"Do you like Mr. Van?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time her interlocutor indeed hung fire. \"How can I tell? He dazzles\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But don't you like that?\" Then before he could really say: \"You're\r\n",
      "afraid he may be false?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this he fairly laughed. \"You go to the point!\" She just coloured to\r\n",
      "have amused him so, but he quickly went on: \"I think one has a little\r\n",
      "natural nervousness at being carried off one's feet. I'm afraid I've\r\n",
      "always liked too much to see where I'm going.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you don't with him?\" She spoke with her curious hard interest. \"I\r\n",
      "understand. But I think I like to be dazzled.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you've got time--you can come round again; you've a margin for\r\n",
      "accidents, for disappointments and recoveries: you can take one thing\r\n",
      "with another. But I've only my last little scrap.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you want to make no mistakes--I see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'm too easily upset.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah so am I,\" said Nanda. \"I assure you that in spite of what you say\r\n",
      "I want to make no mistakes either. I've seen a great many--though you\r\n",
      "mightn't think it,\" she persisted; \"I really know what they may be. Do\r\n",
      "you like ME?\" she brought forth. But even on this she spared him too; a\r\n",
      "look appeared to have been enough for her. \"How can you say, of course,\r\n",
      "already?--if you can't say for Mr. Van. I mean as you've seen him so\r\n",
      "much. When he asked me just now if I liked YOU I told him it was too\r\n",
      "soon. But it isn't now; you see it goes fast. I DO like you.\" She gave\r\n",
      "him no time to acknowledge this tribute, but--as if it were a matter of\r\n",
      "course--tried him quickly with something else. \"Can you say if you like\r\n",
      "mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could meet it pretty well now. \"There are immense reasons why I\r\n",
      "should.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--I know about them, as I mentioned: mother has told me.\" But what\r\n",
      "she had to put to him kept up his surprise. \"Have reasons anything to\r\n",
      "do with it? I don't believe you like her!\" she exclaimed. \"SHE doesn't\r\n",
      "think so,\" she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man's face at last, partly bewildered, partly reassured, showed\r\n",
      "something finer still in the effect she produced. \"Into what mysteries\r\n",
      "you plunge!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh we do; that's what every one says of us. We discuss everything and\r\n",
      "every one--we're always discussing each other. I think we must be rather\r\n",
      "celebrated for it, and it's a kind of trick--isn't it?--that's catching.\r\n",
      "But don't you think it's the most interesting sort of talk? Mother says\r\n",
      "we haven't any prejudices. YOU have, probably, quantities--and beautiful\r\n",
      "ones: so perhaps I oughtn't to tell you. But you'll find out for\r\n",
      "yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--I'm rather slow; but I generally end by finding out. And I've got,\r\n",
      "thank heaven,\" said Mr. Longdon, \"quite prejudices enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I hope you'll tell me some of them,\" Nanda replied in a tone\r\n",
      "evidently marking how much he pleased her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you must do as _I_ do--you must find out for yourself. Your\r\n",
      "resemblance to your grandmother is quite prodigious,\" he immediately\r\n",
      "added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's what I wish you'd tell me about--your recollection of her and\r\n",
      "your wonderful feeling about her. Mother has told me things, but that I\r\n",
      "should have something straight from you is exactly what she also wants.\r\n",
      "My grandmother must have been awfully nice,\" the girl rambled on, \"and I\r\n",
      "somehow don't see myself at all as the same sort of person.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't say you're in the least the same sort: all I allude to,\"\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon returned, \"is the miracle of the physical heredity. Nothing\r\n",
      "could be less like her than your manner and your talk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda looked at him with all her honesty. \"They're not so good, you must\r\n",
      "think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hung fire an instant, but was as honest as she. \"You're separated\r\n",
      "from her by a gulf--and not only of time. Personally, you see, you\r\n",
      "breathe a different air.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought--she quite took it in. \"Of course. And you breathe the\r\n",
      "same--the same old one, I mean, as my grandmother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The same old one,\" Mr. Longdon smiled, \"as much as possible. Some day\r\n",
      "I'll tell you more of what you're curious of. I can't go into it now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because I've upset you so?\" Nanda frankly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's one of the reasons.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think I can see another too,\" she observed after a moment. \"You're\r\n",
      "not sure how much I shall understand. But I shall understand,\" she went\r\n",
      "on, \"more, perhaps, than you think. In fact,\" she said earnestly, \"I\r\n",
      "PROMISE to understand. I've some imagination. Had my grandmother?\"\r\n",
      "she asked. Her actual sequences were not rapid, but she had already\r\n",
      "anticipated him. \"I've thought of that before, because I put the same\r\n",
      "question to mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what did your mother say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Imagination--dear mamma? Not a grain!'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man showed a faint flush. \"Your mother then has a supply that\r\n",
      "makes up for it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl fixed him on this with a deeper attention. \"You don't like her\r\n",
      "having said that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His colour came stronger, though a slightly strained smile did what it\r\n",
      "could to diffuse coolness. \"I don't care a single scrap, my dear, in\r\n",
      "respect to the friend I'm speaking of, for any judgement but my own.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not even for her daughter's?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not even for her daughter's.\" Mr. Longdon had not spoken loud, but he\r\n",
      "rang as clear as a bell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda, for admiration of it, broke almost for the first time into the\r\n",
      "semblance of a smile. \"You feel as if my grandmother were quite YOUR\r\n",
      "property!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh quite.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I say--that's splendid!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm glad you like it,\" he answered kindly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The very kindness pulled her up. \"Pardon my speaking so, but I'm sure\r\n",
      "you know what I mean. You mustn't think,\" she eagerly continued, \"that\r\n",
      "mother won't also want to hear you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the subject of Lady Julia?\" He gently, but very effectively, shook\r\n",
      "his head. \"Your mother shall never hear me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda appeared to wonder at it an instant, and it made her completely\r\n",
      "grave again. \"It will be all for ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Whatever there may be of it, my dear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I shall get it all out of you,\" she returned without hesitation.\r\n",
      "Her mixture of free familiarity and of the vividness of evocation of\r\n",
      "something, whatever it was, sharply opposed--the little worry of\r\n",
      "this contradiction, not altogether unpleasant, continued to fill\r\n",
      "his consciousness more discernibly than anything else. It was really\r\n",
      "reflected in his quick brown eyes that she alternately drew him on and\r\n",
      "warned him off, but also that what they were beginning more and more to\r\n",
      "make out was an emotion of her own trembling there beneath her tension.\r\n",
      "His glimpse of it widened--his glimpse of it fairly triumphed when\r\n",
      "suddenly, after this last declaration, she threw off with quite the\r\n",
      "same accent but quite another effect: \"I'm glad to be like any one the\r\n",
      "thought of whom makes you so good! You ARE good,\" she continued; \"I see\r\n",
      "already how I shall feel it.\" She stared at him with tears, the sight of\r\n",
      "which brought his own straight back; so that thus for a moment they sat\r\n",
      "there together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child!\" he at last simply murmured. But he laid his hand on her\r\n",
      "now, and her own immediately met it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll get used to me,\" she said with the same gentleness that the\r\n",
      "response of her touch had tried to express; \"and I shall be so careful\r\n",
      "with you that--well, you'll see!\" She broke short off with a quaver and\r\n",
      "the next instant she turned--there was some one at the door. Vanderbank,\r\n",
      "still not quite at his ease, had come back to smile upon them. Detaching\r\n",
      "herself from Mr. Longdon she got straight up to meet him. \"You were\r\n",
      "right, Mr. Van. It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!\"\r\n",

      "BOOK FOURTH. MR. CASHMORE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Harold Brookenham, whom Mr. Cashmore, ushered in and announced, had\r\n",
      "found in the act of helping himself to a cup of tea at the table\r\n",
      "apparently just prepared--Harold Brookenham arrived at the point with\r\n",
      "a dash so direct as to leave the visitor an option between but two\r\n",
      "suppositions: that of a desperate plunge, to have his shame soon over,\r\n",
      "or that of the acquired habit of such appeals, which had taught him the\r\n",
      "easiest way. There was no great sharpness in the face of Mr. Cashmore,\r\n",
      "who was somehow massive without majesty; yet he mightn't have been proof\r\n",
      "against the suspicion that his young friend's embarrassment was an\r\n",
      "easy precaution, a conscious corrective to the danger of audacity. It\r\n",
      "wouldn't have been impossible to divine that if Harold shut his eyes and\r\n",
      "jumped it was mainly for the appearance of doing so. Experience was to\r\n",
      "be taken as showing that one might get a five-pound note as one got a\r\n",
      "light for a cigarette; but one had to check the friendly impulse to ask\r\n",
      "for it in the same way. Mr. Cashmore had in fact looked surprised, yet\r\n",
      "not on the whole so surprised as the young man seemed to have expected\r\n",
      "of him. There was almost a quiet grace in the combination of promptitude\r\n",
      "and diffidence with which Harold took over the responsibility of all\r\n",
      "proprietorship of the crisp morsel of paper that he slipped with slow\r\n",
      "firmness into the pocket of his waistcoat, rubbing it gently in its\r\n",
      "passage against the delicately buff-coloured duck of which that garment\r\n",
      "was composed. \"So quite too awfully kind of you that I really don't know\r\n",
      "what to say\"--there was a marked recall, in the manner of this speech,\r\n",
      "of the sweetness of his mother's droop and the tenderness of her wail.\r\n",
      "It was as if he had been moved for the moment to moralise, but the\r\n",
      "eyes he raised to his benefactor had the oddest effect of marking that\r\n",
      "personage himself as a theme for the moralist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Cashmore, who would have been very red-haired if he had not been\r\n",
      "very bald, showed a single eye-glass and a long upper lip; he was large\r\n",
      "and jaunty, with little petulant movements and intense ejaculations that\r\n",
      "were not in the line of his type. \"You may say anything you like if you\r\n",
      "don't say you'll repay it. That's always nonsense--I hate it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Harold remained sad, but showed himself really superior. \"Then I won't\r\n",
      "say it.\" Pensively, a minute, he appeared to figure the words, in their\r\n",
      "absurdity, on the lips of some young man not, like himself, tactful. \"I\r\n",
      "know just what you mean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I think, you know, that you ought to tell your father,\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Cashmore said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tell him I've borrowed of you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Cashmore good-humouredly demurred. \"It would serve me right--it's\r\n",
      "so wretched my having listened to you. Tell him, certainly,\" he went on\r\n",
      "after an instant. \"But what I mean is that if you're in such straits you\r\n",
      "should speak to him like a man.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Harold smiled at the innocence of a friend who could suppose him not to\r\n",
      "have exhausted that resource. \"I'm ALWAYS speaking to him like a man,\r\n",
      "and that's just what puts him so awfully out. He denies to my face that\r\n",
      "I AM one. One would suppose, to hear him, not only that I'm a small\r\n",
      "objectionable child, but that I'm scarcely even human. He doesn't\r\n",
      "conceive me as with human wants.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" Mr. Cashmore laughed, \"you've all--you youngsters--as many wants,\r\n",
      "I know, as an advertisement page of the Times.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Harold showed an admiration. \"That's awfully good. If you think you\r\n",
      "ought to speak of it,\" he continued, \"do it rather to mamma.\" He noted\r\n",
      "the hour. \"I'll go, if you'll excuse me, to give you the chance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitor referred to his own watch. \"It's your mother herself who\r\n",
      "gives the chances--the chances YOU take.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Harold looked kind and simple. \"She HAS come in, I know. She'll be with\r\n",
      "you in a moment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was halfway to the door, but Mr. Cashmore, though so easy, had not\r\n",
      "done with him. \"I suppose you mean that if it's only your mother who's\r\n",
      "told, you may depend on her to shield you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Harold turned this over as if it were a questionable sovereign, but on\r\n",
      "second thoughts he wonderfully smiled. \"Do you think that after you've\r\n",
      "let me have it you can tell? You could, of course, if you hadn't.\" He\r\n",
      "appeared to work it out for Mr. Cashmore's benefit. \"But I don't mind,\"\r\n",

      "in one's very drawing-room, might go on behind one's back. Harold had\r\n",

      "air of personal good health, the untarnished bloom which sometimes lent\r\n",
      "a monstrous serenity to his mention of the barely mentionable, was on\r\n",
      "occasion balanced or matched by his playful application of extravagant\r\n",
      "terms to matters of much less moment. \"You know what I come to you\r\n",

      "modern has always been my own note--I've gone in, I mean, frankly for my\r\n",
      "very own Time--who is one, after all, that one should pretend to decline\r\n",
      "to go where it may lead?\" Mr. Cashmore was unprepared with an answer\r\n",
      "to this question, and his hostess continued in a different tone: \"It's\r\n",
      "sweet her sparing one!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This, for the visitor, was firmer ground. \"Do you mean about talking\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook's assent was positively tender. \"She won't have a difference\r\n",

      "must keep back. She wants us not to have to think. It's quite maternal!\"\r\n",
      "she mused again. Then as if with the pleasure of presenting it to him\r\n",
      "afresh: \"That's the modern daughter!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mr. Cashmore, \"I can't help wishing she were a trifle less\r\n",
      "considerate. In that case I might find her with you, and I may tell you\r\n",
      "frankly that I get more from her than I do from you. She has the great\r\n",
      "merit for me, in the first place, of not being such an admirer of my\r\n",
      "wife.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham took this up with interest. \"No--you're right; she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"There you are then, you inconsistent creature,\" he cried with a laugh:\r\n",
      "\"after all you DO believe me! You recognise how benighted it would be\r\n",
      "for your daughter not to feel that Fanny's bad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're too tiresome, my dear man,\" Mrs. Brook returned, \"with your\r\n",

      "good--in the sense of being generous and simple and true, too adorably\r\n",
      "unaffected and without the least mesquinerie. She's a great calm silver\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook smiled as with the sadness of having too much to triumph.\r\n",
      "\"Because I'm not, like Fanny, without mesquinerie. I'm not generous\r\n",
      "and simple. I'm exaggeratedly anxious about Nanda. I care, in spite of\r\n",
      "myself, for what people may say. Your wife doesn't--she towers above\r\n",
      "them. I can be a shade less brave through the chance of my girl's not\r\n",
      "happening to feel her as the rest of us do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Cashmore too heavily followed. \"To 'feel' her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "glorious pagan. It's a real relief to know such a type--it's like a\r\n",
      "flash of insight into history. None the less if you ask me why then it\r\n",
      "isn't all right for young things to 'shriek' as I say, I have my answer\r\n",
      "perfectly ready.\" After which, as her visitor seemed not only too\r\n",
      "reduced to doubt it, but too baffled to distinguish audibly, for his\r\n",
      "credit, between resignation and admiration, she produced: \"Because she's\r\n",
      "purely instinctive. Her instincts are splendid--but it's terrific.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's all I ever maintained it to be!\" Mr. Cashmore cried. \"It IS\r\n",
      "terrific.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" his friend answered, \"I'm watching her. We're all watching her.\r\n",

      "high tide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're amazing!\" Mr. Cashmore laughed. \"I'm watching her too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I'm also watching YOU!\" Mrs. Brook lucidly continued. \"What I don't\r\n",
      "for a moment believe is that her bills are paid by any one. It's MUCH\r\n",
      "more probable,\" she sagaciously observed, \"that they're not paid at\r\n",
      "all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh well, if she can get on that way--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There can't be a place in London,\" Mrs. Brook pursued, \"where they're\r\n",
      "not delighted to dress such a woman. She shows things, don't you see?\r\n",
      "as some fine tourist region shows the placards in the fields and the\r\n",
      "posters on the rocks. And what proof can you adduce?\" she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Cashmore had grown restless; he picked a stray thread off the knee\r\n",
      "of his trousers. \"Ah when you talk about 'adducing'--!\" He appeared to\r\n",
      "intimate--as with the hint that if she didn't take care she might bore\r\n",
      "him--that it was the kind of word he used only in the House of Commons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When I talk about it you can't meet me,\" she placidly returned. But she\r\n",
      "fixed him with her weary penetration. \"You try to believe what you CAN'T\r\n",
      "believe, in order to give yourself excuses. And she does the same--only\r\n",
      "less, for she recognises less in general the need of them. She's so\r\n",
      "grand and simple.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Mr. Cashmore stared. \"Grander and simpler than I, you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham thought. \"Not simpler--no; but very much grander. She\r\n",
      "wouldn't, in the case you conceive, recognise really the need of WHAT\r\n",
      "you conceive.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Cashmore wondered--it was almost mystic. \"I don't understand you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, seeing it all from dim depths, tracked it further and\r\n",
      "further. \"We've talked her over so!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Cashmore groaned as if too conscious of it. \"Indeed we have!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean WE\"--and it was wonderful how her accent discriminated. \"We've\r\n",
      "talked you too--but of course we talk to every one.\" She had a pause\r\n",
      "through which there glimmered a ray from luminous hours, the inner\r\n",
      "intimacy which, privileged as he was, he couldn't pretend to share; then\r\n",
      "she broke out almost impatiently: \"We're looking after her--leave her to\r\n",
      "US!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His envy of this nearer approach to what so touched him than he could\r\n",
      "himself achieve was in his face, but he tried to throw it off. \"I doubt\r\n",
      "if after all you're good for her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mrs. Brookenham knew. \"She's just the sort of person we ARE good\r\n",
      "for, and the thing for her is to be with us as much as possible--just\r\n",
      "live with us naturally and easily, listen to our talk, feel our\r\n",
      "confidence in her, be kept up, don't you know? by the sense of what we\r\n",
      "expect of her splendid type, and so, little by little, let our influence\r\n",
      "act. What I meant to say just now is that I do perfectly see her taking\r\n",
      "what you call presents.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then,\" Mr. Cashmore enquired, \"what do you want more?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook hung fire an instant--she seemed on the point of telling him.\r\n",
      "\"I DON'T see her, as I said, recognising the obligation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The obligation--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To give anything back. Anything at all.\" Mrs. Brook was positive. \"The\r\n",
      "comprehension of petty calculations? Never!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't say the calculations are petty,\" Mr. Cashmore objected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, she's a great creature. If she does fall--!\" His hostess lost\r\n",
      "herself in the view, which was at last all before her. \"Be sure we shall\r\n",

      "her headshake, \"that couldn't be. We MUST keep her up--that's your\r\n",
      "guarantee. It's rather too much,\" she added with the same increase of\r\n",
      "briskness, \"to have to keep YOU up too. Be very sure that if Carrie\r\n",
      "really wavers--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Carrie?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His interruption was clearly too vague to be sincere, and it was as such\r\n",
      "that, going straight on, she treated it. \"I shall never again give\r\n",

      "wholly LOATHE Mrs. Donner.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, staring, met the announcement with an absolute change of\r\n",
      "colour. \"And since when, pray?\" It was as if a fabric had crumbled. \"She\r\n",
      "was here but the other day, and as full of you, poor thing, as an egg of\r\n",
      "meat.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nothing, for a spectator, could have been so odd as Mrs. Brook's\r\n",
      "disappointment unless it had been her determination. \"Have you done with\r\n",

      "\"One has never done with a buzzing insect--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Until one has literally killed it?\" Mrs. Brookenham wailed. \"I\r\n",
      "can't take that from you, my dear man: it was yourself who originally\r\n",
      "distilled the poison that courses through her veins.\" He jumped up at\r\n",
      "this as if he couldn't bear it, presenting as he walked across the room,\r\n",
      "however, a large foolish fugitive back on which her eyes rested as on a\r\n",
      "proof of her penetration. \"If you spoil everything by trying to deceive\r\n",
      "me, how can I help you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had looked, in his restlessness, at a picture or two, but he finally\r\n",
      "turned round. \"With whom is it you talk us over? With Petherton and his\r\n",
      "friend Mitchy? With your adored Vanderbank? With your awful Duchess?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You know my little circle, and you've not always despised it.\" She met\r\n",
      "him on his return with a figure that had visibly flashed out for her.\r\n",
      "\"Don't foul your own nest! Remember that after all we've more or less\r\n",
      "produced you.\" She had a smile that attenuated a little her image, for\r\n",
      "there were things that on a second thought he appeared ready to take\r\n",
      "from her. She patted the sofa as if to invite him again to be seated,\r\n",
      "and though he still stood before her it was with a face that seemed to\r\n",
      "show how her touch went home. \"You know I've never quite thought you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There might have been in her momentary silence a hint of acceptance of\r\n",
      "it as a practical contribution to their problem, and there were indeed\r\n",
      "several lights in which it could be considered. Mrs. Brook, on a quick\r\n",
      "survey, selected the ironic. \"I see, I see. I might by the same law\r\n",

      "her mirth. \"I like your daughter better than I like you.\"\r\n",

      "your purity?\"\r\n",

      "What he might have replied remained in the air, for the door opened so\r\n",
      "exactly at the moment she spoke that he rose again with a start and\r\n",
      "the butler, coming in, received her enquiry full in the face. This\r\n",
      "functionary's answer to it, however, had no more than the usual\r\n",

      "Mrs. Brookenham, who had introduced him to the elder of her visitors,\r\n",

      "him with an intensity not to be resisted: \"Talk to Mr. Longdon--take him\r\n",

      "and had set him an example by possessing herself, in the place she\r\n",
      "already occupied, of her \"adored\" Vanderbank. This arrangement, however,\r\n",
      "constituted for her, in her own corner, as soon as she had made it, the\r\n",

      "avoid mistakes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then don't try quite so hard!\" Vanderbank laughed. \"Is that your reason\r\n",
      "for throwing him into Cashmore's arms?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, precisely--so that I shall have these few moments to ask you for\r\n",

      "already taken in so much. \"He wants to judge of what I may be doing to\r\n",
      "you--he wants to save you from me. He quite detests me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, with the interest as well as the amusement, fairly threw\r\n",
      "himself back. \"There's nobody like you--you're too magnificent!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I AM; and that I can look the truth in the face and not be angry or\r\n",
      "silly about it is, as you know, the one thing in the world for which I\r\n",

      "\"Through an extraordinary fancy he has suddenly taken to her.\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook had been swift to master the facts. \"He has been meeting her at\r\n",
      "Tishy's, and she has talked to him so effectually about his behaviour\r\n",
      "that she has quite made him cease to care for Carrie. He prefers HER\r\n",
      "now--and of course she's much nicer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's attention, it was clear, had now been fully seized. \"She's\r\n",

      "questions?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why SHOULD I ask any--when I want her life to be as much as possible\r\n",
      "like my own? It's simply that the hour has struck, as you know. From the\r\n",
      "moment she IS down the only thing for us is to live as friends. I think\r\n",
      "it's so vulgar,\" Mrs. Brook sighed, \"not to have the same good manners\r\n",
      "with one's children as one has with other people. She asks ME nothing.\"\r\n",

      "\"Nothing?\" Vanderbank echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused again; after which, \"It's very disgusting!\" he declared. Then\r\n",
      "while she took it up as he had taken her word of a moment before, \"It's\r\n",
      "very preposterous,\" he continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook appeared at a loss. \"Do you mean her helping him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's not of Nanda I'm speaking--it's of him.\" Vanderbank spoke with a\r\n",
      "certain impatience. \"His being with her in any sort of direct relation\r\n",
      "at all. His mixing her up with his other beastly affairs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook looked intelligent and wan about it, but also perfectly\r\n",
      "good-humoured. \"My dear man, he and his affairs ARE such twaddle!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank laughed in spite of himself. \"And does that make it any\r\n",
      "better?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook thought, but presently had a light--she almost smiled with\r\n",

      "she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why should I? Not a jot. Carrie be hanged!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it's for Fanny,\" Mrs. Brook protested. \"If Carrie IS rescued it's\r\n",
      "a pretext the less for Fanny.\" As the young man looked for an instant\r\n",
      "rather gloomily vague she softly quavered: \"I suppose you don't\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"To bolt?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Surely I've not to remind you at this time of day how Captain\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But why not let her go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, at this, showed real resentment. \"'Go'? Then what would\r\n",

      "our life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" Vanderbank sceptically murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's the ornament of our circle,\" his companion insisted. \"She will,\r\n",
      "she won't--she won't, she will! It's the excitement, every day, of\r\n",
      "plucking the daisy over.\" Vanderbank's attention, as she spoke, had\r\n",
      "attached itself across the room to Mr. Longdon; it gave her thus an\r\n",
      "image of the way his imagination had just seemed to her to stray, and\r\n",
      "she saw a reason in it moreover for her coming up in another place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't he rather rich?\" She allowed the question all its effect of\r\n",
      "abruptness.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Not after becoming so intimate? It's usually, with people, the very\r\n",
      "first thing I get my impression of.\" There came into her face for\r\n",
      "another glance at their friend no crudity of curiosity, but an\r\n",
      "expression more tenderly wistful. \"He must have some mysterious box\r\n",
      "under his bed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Down in Suffolk?--a miser's hoard? Who knows? I dare say,\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "went on. \"He isn't a miser, but he strikes me as careful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook meanwhile had thought it out. \"Then he has something to be\r\n",
      "careful of; it would take something really handsome to inspire in a man\r\n",
      "like him that sort of interest. With his small expenses all these years\r\n",
      "his savings must be immense. And how could he have proposed to mamma\r\n",
      "unless he had originally had money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If Vanderbank a little helplessly wondered he also laughed. \"You must\r\n",
      "remember your mother refused him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but not because there wasn't enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--I imagine the force of the blow for him was just in the other\r\n",
      "reason.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it would have been in that one just as much if that one had been\r\n",
      "the other.\" Mrs. Brook was sagacious, though a trifle obscure, and she\r\n",
      "pursued the next moment: \"Mamma was so sincere. The fortune was nothing\r\n",
      "to her. That shows it was immense.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It couldn't have been as great as your logic,\" Vanderbank smiled; \"but\r\n",
      "of course if it has been growing ever since--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can see it grow while he sits there,\" Mrs. Brook declared. But her\r\n",
      "logic had in fact its own law, and her next transition was an equal\r\n",
      "jump. \"It was too lovely, the frankness of your admission a minute ago\r\n",
      "that I affect him uncannily. Ah don't spoil it by explanations!\" she\r\n",
      "beautifully pleaded: \"he's not the first and he won't be the last with\r\n",
      "whom I shall not have been what they call a combination. The only thing\r\n",
      "that matters is that I mustn't, if possible, make the case worse. So you\r\n",
      "must guide me. What IS one to do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, now amused again, looked at her kindly. \"Be yourself, my\r\n",
      "dear woman. Obey your fine instincts.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can you be,\" she sweetly asked, \"so hideously hypocritical? You\r\n",
      "know as well as you sit there that my fine instincts are the thing in\r\n",
      "the world you're most in terror of. 'Be myself?'\" she echoed. \"What\r\n",
      "you'd LIKE to say is: 'Be somebody else--that's your only chance.' Well,\r\n",
      "I'll try--I'll try.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed again, shaking his head. \"Don't--don't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean it's too hopeless? There's no way of effacing the bad\r\n",
      "impression or of starting a good one?\" On this, with a drop of his\r\n",
      "mirth, he met her eyes, and for an instant, through the superficial\r\n",
      "levity of their talk, they might have appeared to sound each other. It\r\n",
      "lasted till Mrs. Brook went on: \"I should really like not to lose him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank seemed to understand and at last said: \"I think you won't\r\n",
      "lose him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean you'll help me, Van, you WILL?\" Her voice had at moments\r\n",
      "the most touching tones of any in England, and humble, helpless,\r\n",
      "affectionate, she spoke with a familiarity of friendship. \"It's for the\r\n",
      "sense of the link with mamma,\" she explained. \"He's simply full of her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know. He's prodigious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has told you more--he comes back to it?\" Mrs. Brook eagerly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" the young man replied a trifle evasively, \"we've had a great\r\n",
      "deal of talk, and he's the jolliest old boy possible, and in short I\r\n",
      "like him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see,\" said Mrs. Brook blandly, \"and he likes you in return as much as\r\n",
      "he despises me. That makes it all right--makes me somehow so happy for\r\n",
      "you. There's something in him--what is it?--that suggests the oncle\r\n",
      "d'Amerique, the eccentric benefactor, the fairy godmother. He's a\r\n",
      "little of an old woman--but all the better for it.\" She hung fire but an\r\n",
      "instant before she pursued: \"What can we make him do for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank at this was very blank. \"Do for me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can any one love you,\" she asked, \"without wanting to show it in\r\n",
      "some way? You know all the ways, dear Van,\" she breathed, \"in which I\r\n",
      "want to show it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He might have known them, something suddenly fixed in his face appeared\r\n",
      "to say, but they were not what was, on this speech of hers, most\r\n",
      "immediately present to him. \"That for instance is the tone not to take\r\n",
      "with him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There you are!\" she sighed with discouragement. \"Well, only TELL me.\"\r\n",
      "Then as he said nothing: \"I must be more like mamma?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His expression confessed to his feeling an awkwardness. \"You're perhaps\r\n",
      "not quite enough like her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know that if he deplores me as I am now she would have done so\r\n",
      "quite as much; in fact probably, as seeing it nearer, a good deal more.\r\n",
      "She'd have despised me even more than he. But if it's a question,\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook went on, \"of not saying what mamma wouldn't, how can I know, don't\r\n",
      "you see, what she WOULD have said?\" Mrs. Brook became as wonderful as if\r\n",
      "she saw in her friend's face some admiring reflexion of the fine freedom\r\n",
      "of mind that--in such a connexion quite as much as in any other--she\r\n",
      "could always show. \"Of course I revere mamma just as much as he does,\r\n",
      "and there was everything in her to revere. But she was none the less in\r\n",
      "every way a charming woman too, and I don't know, after all, do I? what\r\n",
      "even she--in their peculiar relation--may not have said to him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's laugh came back. \"Very good--very good. I return to my\r\n",
      "first idea. Try with him whatever comes into your head. You're a woman\r\n",
      "of genius after all, and genius mostly justifies itself. To make you\r\n",
      "right,\" he went on pleasantly and inexorably, \"might perhaps be to make\r\n",
      "you wrong. Since you HAVE so great a charm trust it not at all or all in\r\n",
      "all. That, I dare say, is all you can do. Therefore--yes--be yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These remarks were followed on either side by the repetition of a\r\n",
      "somewhat intenser mutual gaze, though indeed the speaker's eyes had more\r\n",
      "the air of meeting his friend's than of seeking them. \"I can't be YOU\r\n",
      "certainly, Van,\" Mrs. Brook sadly brought forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know what you mean by that,\" he rejoined in a moment. \"You mean I'm\r\n",
      "hypocritical.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hypocritical?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm diplomatic and calculating--I don't show him how bad I am; whereas\r\n",
      "with you he knows the worst.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of this observation Mrs. Brook, whose eyes attached themselves again\r\n",
      "to Mr. Longdon, took at first no further notice than might have been\r\n",
      "indicated by the way it set her musing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Calculating'?\"--she at last took him up. \"On what is there to\r\n",
      "calculate?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Vanderbank, \"if, as you just hinted, he's a blessing\r\n",
      "in disguise--! I perfectly admit,\" he resumed, \"that I'm capable of\r\n",
      "sacrifices to keep on good terms with him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're not afraid he'll bore you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--distinctly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But he'll be worth it? Then,\" Mrs. Brook said as he appeared to assent,\r\n",
      "\"he'll be worth a great deal.\" She continued to watch Mr. Longdon, who,\r\n",
      "without his glasses, stared straight at the floor while Mr. Cashmore\r\n",
      "talked to him. She pursued, however, dispassionately enough: \"He must be\r\n",
      "of a narrowness--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh beautiful!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was silent again. \"I shall broaden him. YOU won't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heaven forbid!\" Vanderbank heartily concurred. \"But none the less, as\r\n",
      "I've said, I'll help you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her attention was still fixed. \"It will be him you'll help. If you're to\r\n",
      "make sacrifices to keep on good terms with him the first sacrifice will\r\n",
      "be of me.\" Then on his leaving this remark so long unanswered that she\r\n",
      "had finally looked at him again: \"I'm perfectly prepared for it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was as if, jocosely enough, he had had time to make up his mind how\r\n",
      "to meet her. \"What will you have--when he loved my mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing could have been droller than the gloom of her surprise. \"Yours\r\n",
      "too?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I didn't tell you the other day--out of delicacy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham darkly thought. \"HE didn't tell me either.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The same consideration deterred him. But if I didn't speak of it,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank continued, \"when I arranged with you, after meeting him here\r\n",
      "at dinner, that you should come to tea with him at my rooms--if I didn't\r\n",
      "mention it then it wasn't because I hadn't learnt it early.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook more deeply sounded this affair, but she spoke with the\r\n",
      "exaggerated mildness that was the form mostly taken by her gaiety. \"It\r\n",
      "was because of course it makes him out such a wretch! What becomes in\r\n",
      "that case of his loyalty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To YOUR mother's memory? Oh it's all right--he has it quite straight.\r\n",
      "She came later. Mine, after my father's death, had refused him. But you\r\n",
      "see he might have been my stepfather.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham took it in, but she had suddenly a brighter light. \"He\r\n",
      "might have been my OWN father! Besides,\" she went on, \"if his line is to\r\n",
      "love the mothers why on earth doesn't he love ME? I'm in all conscience\r\n",
      "enough of one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but isn't there in your case the fact of a daughter?\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "asked with a slight embarrassment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham stared. \"What good does that do me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, didn't she tell you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nanda? She told me he doesn't like her any better than he likes me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank in his turn showed surprise. \"That's really what she said?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She had on her return from your rooms a most unusual fit of frankness,\r\n",
      "for she generally tells me nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Vanderbank, \"how did she put it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook reflected--recovered it. \"'I like him awfully, but I am not\r\n",
      "in the least HIS idea.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His idea of what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just what I asked her. Of the proper grandchild for mamma.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank hesitated. \"Well, she isn't.\" Then after another pause: \"But\r\n",
      "she'll do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion gave him a deep look. \"You'll make her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got up, and on seeing him move Mr. Longdon also rose, so that, facing\r\n",
      "each other across the room, they exchanged a friendly signal or two.\r\n",
      "\"I'll make her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their hostess's account of Mr. Cashmore's motive for his staying on was\r\n",
      "so far justified as that Vanderbank, while Mr. Longdon came over to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook, appeared without difficulty further to engage him. The lady in\r\n",
      "question meanwhile had drawn her old friend down, and her present method\r\n",
      "of approach would have interested an observer aware of the unhappy\r\n",
      "conviction she had just privately expressed. Some trace indeed of the\r\n",
      "glimpse of it enjoyed by Mr. Cashmere's present interlocutor might have\r\n",
      "been detected in the restlessness that Vanderbank's desire to keep the\r\n",
      "other pair uninterrupted was still not able to banish from his attitude.\r\n",
      "Not, however, that Mrs. Brook took the smallest account of it as she\r\n",
      "quickly broke out: \"How can we thank you enough, my dear man, for your\r\n",
      "extraordinary kindness?\" The reference was vivid, yet Mr. Longdon looked\r\n",
      "so blank about it that she had immediately to explain. \"I mean to dear\r\n",
      "Van, who has told us of your giving him the great happiness--unless he's\r\n",
      "too dreadfully mistaken--of letting him really know you. He's such a\r\n",
      "tremendous friend of ours that nothing so delightful can befall him\r\n",
      "without its affecting us in the same way.\" She had proceeded with\r\n",
      "confidence, but suddenly she pulled up. \"Don't tell me he IS mistaken--I\r\n",
      "shouldn't be able to bear it.\" She challenged the pale old man with\r\n",
      "a loveliness that was for the moment absolutely juvenile. \"Aren't you\r\n",
      "letting him--really?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's smile was queer. \"I can't prevent him. I'm not a great\r\n",
      "house--to give orders to go over me. The kindness is Mr. Vanderbank's\r\n",
      "own, and I've taken up, I'm afraid, a great deal of his precious time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have indeed.\" Mrs. Brook was undiscouraged. \"He has been talking\r\n",
      "with me just now of nothing else. You may say,\" she went on, \"that it's\r\n",
      "I who have kept him at it. So I have, for his pleasure's a joy to us. If\r\n",
      "you can't prevent what he feels, you know, you can't prevent either what\r\n",
      "WE feel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's face reflected for a minute something he could scarcely\r\n",
      "have supposed her acute enough to make out, the struggle between his\r\n",
      "real mistrust of her, founded on the unconscious violence offered by\r\n",
      "her nature to his every memory of her mother, and his sense on the other\r\n",
      "hand of the high propriety of his liking her; to which latter force his\r\n",
      "interest in Vanderbank was a contribution, inasmuch as he was obliged\r\n",
      "to recognise on the part of the pair an alliance it would have been\r\n",
      "difficult to explain at Beccles. \"Perhaps I don't quite see the value of\r\n",
      "what your husband and you and I are in a position to do for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean because he's himself so clever?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mr. Longdon, \"I dare say that's at the bottom of my feeling\r\n",
      "so proud to be taken up by him. I think of the young men of MY time\r\n",
      "and see that he takes in more. But that's what you all do,\" he rather\r\n",
      "helplessly sighed. \"You're very, very wonderful!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She met him with an almost extravagant eagerness that the meeting should\r\n",
      "be just where he wished. \"I don't take in everything, but I take in all\r\n",
      "I can. That's a great affair in London to-day, and I often feel as if\r\n",
      "I were a circus-woman, in pink tights and no particular skirts, riding\r\n",
      "half a dozen horses at once. We're all in the troupe now, I suppose,\"\r\n",
      "she smiled, \"and we must travel with the show. But when you say we're\r\n",
      "different,\" she added, \"think, after all, of mamma.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon stared. \"It's from her you ARE different.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but she had an awfully fine mind. We're not cleverer than she.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His conscious honest eyes looked away an instant. \"It's perhaps enough\r\n",
      "for the present that you're cleverer than I! I was very glad the other\r\n",
      "day,\" he continued, \"to make the acquaintance of your daughter. I hoped\r\n",
      "I should find her with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If Mrs. Brook cast about it was but for a few seconds. \"If she had known\r\n",
      "you were coming she would certainly have been here. She wanted so to\r\n",
      "please you.\" Then as her visitor took no further notice of this speech\r\n",
      "than to ask if Nanda were out of the house she had to admit it as an\r\n",
      "aggravation of failure; but she pursued in the next breath: \"Of course\r\n",
      "you won't care, but she raves about you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He appeared indeed at first not to care. \"Isn't she eighteen?\"--it was\r\n",
      "oddly abrupt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have to think. Wouldn't it be nearer twenty?\" Mrs. Brook audaciously\r\n",
      "returned. She tried again. \"She told me all about your interview. I\r\n",
      "stayed away on purpose--I had my idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what WAS your idea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought she'd remind you more of mamma if I wasn't there. But she's a\r\n",
      "little person who sees. Perhaps you didn't think it, but she knew.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what did she know?\" asked Mr. Longdon, who was unable, however, to\r\n",
      "keep from his tone a certain coldness which really deprived the question\r\n",
      "of its proper curiosity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook just showed the chill of it, but she had always her courage.\r\n",
      "\"Why that you don't like her.\" She had the courage of carrying off\r\n",
      "as well as of backing out. \"She too has her little place with the\r\n",
      "circus--it's the way we earn our living.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon said nothing for a moment and when he at last spoke it was\r\n",
      "almost with an air of contradiction. \"She's your mother to the life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His hostess, for three seconds, looked at him hard. \"Ah but with such\r\n",
      "differences! You'll lose it,\" she added with a headshake of pity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had his eyes only on Vanderbank. \"Well, my losses are my own affair.\"\r\n",
      "Then his face came back. \"Did she tell you I didn't like her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The indulgence in Mrs. Brook's view of his simplicity was marked. \"You\r\n",
      "thought you succeeded so in hiding it? No matter--she bears up. I think\r\n",
      "she really feels a great deal as I do--that it's no matter how many of\r\n",
      "us you hate if you'll only go on feeling as you do about mamma. Show us\r\n",
      "THAT--that's what we want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing could have expressed more the balm of reassurance, but the mild\r\n",
      "drops had fallen short of the spot to which they were directed. \"'Show'\r\n",
      "you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh how he had sounded the word! \"I see--you DON'T show. That's just what\r\n",
      "Nanda saw you thought! But you can't keep us from knowing it--can't keep\r\n",
      "it in fact, I think, from affecting your own behaviour. You'd be much\r\n",
      "worse to us if it wasn't for the still warm ashes of your old passion.\"\r\n",
      "It was an immense pity for Vanderbank's amusement that he was at this\r\n",
      "moment too far off to fit to the expression of his old friend's face so\r\n",
      "much of the cause of it as had sprung from the deeply informed tone\r\n",
      "of Mrs. Brook's allusion. To what degree the speaker herself made the\r\n",
      "connexion will never be known to history, nor whether as she went on she\r\n",
      "thought she bettered her case or she simply lost her head. \"The great\r\n",
      "thing for us is that we can never be for you quite like other ordinary\r\n",
      "people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what's the great thing for ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh for you, there's nothing, I'm afraid, but small things--so small\r\n",
      "that they can scarcely be worth the trouble of your making them out. Our\r\n",
      "being so happy that you've come back to us--if only just for a glimpse\r\n",
      "and to leave us again, in no matter what horror, for ever; our positive\r\n",
      "delight in your being exactly so different; the pleasure we have in\r\n",
      "talking about you, and shall still have--or indeed all the more--even\r\n",
      "if we've seen you only to lose you: whatever all this represents for\r\n",
      "ourselves it's for none of us to pretend to say how much or how little\r\n",
      "YOU may pick out of it. And yet,\" Mrs. Brook wandered on, \"however much\r\n",
      "we may disappoint you some little spark of the past can't help being\r\n",
      "in us--for the past is the one thing beyond all spoiling: there it is,\r\n",
      "don't you think?--to speak for itself and, if need be, only OF itself.\"\r\n",
      "She pulled up, but she appeared to have destroyed all power of speech in\r\n",
      "him, so that while she waited she had time for a fresh inspiration. It\r\n",
      "might perhaps frankly have been mentioned as on the whole her finest.\r\n",
      "\"Don't you think it possible that if you once get the point of view of\r\n",
      "realising that I KNOW--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She held the note so long that he at last supplied a sound. \"That you\r\n",
      "know what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why that compared with her I'm a poor creeping thing. I mean\"--she\r\n",
      "hastened to forestall any protest of mere decency that would spoil her\r\n",
      "idea--\"that of course I ache in every limb with the certainty of my\r\n",
      "dreadful difference. It isn't as if I DIDN'T know it, don't you see?\r\n",
      "There it is as a matter of course: I've helplessly but finally and\r\n",
      "completely accepted it. Won't THAT help you?\" she so ingeniously\r\n",
      "pleaded. \"It isn't as if I tormented you with any recall of her\r\n",
      "whatever. I can quite see how awful it would be for you if, with the\r\n",
      "effect I produce on you, I did have her lovely eyes or her distinguished\r\n",
      "nose or the shape of her forehead or the colour of her hair. Strange as\r\n",
      "it is in a daughter I'm disconnected altogether, and don't you think\r\n",
      "I MAY be a little saved for you by becoming thus simply out of\r\n",
      "the question? Of course,\" she continued, \"your real trial is poor\r\n",
      "Nanda--she's likewise so fearfully out of it and yet she's so fearfully\r\n",
      "in it. And she,\" said Mrs. Brook for a climax--\"SHE doesn't know!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A strange faint flush, while she talked, had come into Mr. Longdon's\r\n",
      "face, and, whatever effect, as she put it, she produced on him, it was\r\n",
      "clearly not that of causing his attention to wander. She held him at\r\n",
      "least for weal or woe; his bright eyes grew brighter and opened into a\r\n",
      "stare that finally seemed to offer him as submerged in mere wonder. At\r\n",
      "last, however, he rose to the surface, and he appeared to have lighted\r\n",
      "at the bottom of the sea on the pearl of the particular wisdom\r\n",
      "he needed. \"I dare say there may be something in what you so\r\n",
      "extraordinarily suggest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She jumped at it as if in pleasant pain. \"In just letting me go--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at this he dropped. \"I shall never let you go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It renewed her fear. \"Not just for what I AM?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rose from his place beside her, but looking away from her and with\r\n",
      "his colour marked. \"I shall never let you go,\" he repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you angel!\" She sprang up more quickly and the others were by this\r\n",
      "time on their feet. \"I've done it, I've done it!\" she joyously cried to\r\n",
      "Vanderbank; \"he likes me, or at least he can bear me--I've found him the\r\n",
      "way; and now I don't care even if he SAYS I haven't.\" Then she turned\r\n",
      "again to her old friend. \"We can manage about Nanda--you needn't ever\r\n",
      "see her. She's 'down' now, but she can go up again. We can arrange it at\r\n",
      "any rate--c'est la moindre des choses.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upon my honour I protest,\" Mr. Cashmore exclaimed, \"against anything\r\n",
      "of the sort! I defy you to 'arrange' that young lady in any such manner\r\n",
      "without also arranging ME. I'm one of her greatest admirers,\" he gaily\r\n",
      "announced to Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank said nothing, and Mr. Longdon seemed to show he would have\r\n",
      "preferred to do the same: that visitor's eyes might have represented\r\n",
      "an appeal to him somehow to intervene, to show the due acquaintance,\r\n",
      "springing from practice and wanting in himself, with the art of\r\n",
      "conversation developed to the point at which it could thus sustain a\r\n",
      "lady in the upper air. Vanderbank's silence might, without his mere kind\r\n",
      "pacific look, have seemed almost inhuman. Poor Mr. Longdon had finally\r\n",
      "to do his own simple best. \"Will you bring your daughter to see me?\" he\r\n",
      "asked of Mrs. Brookenham.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, oh--that's an idea: will you bring her to see ME?\" Mr. Cashmore\r\n",
      "again broke out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook had only fixed Mr. Longdon with the air of unutterable\r\n",
      "things. \"You angel, you angel!\"--they found expression but in that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't need to ask you to bring her, do I?\" Vanderbank now said to his\r\n",
      "hostess. \"I hope you don't mind my bragging all over the place of the\r\n",
      "great honour she did me the other day in appearing quite by herself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite by herself? I say, Mrs. Brook!\" Mr. Cashmore flourished on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was only now that she noticed him; which she did indeed but by\r\n",
      "answering Vanderbank. \"She didn't go for YOU I'm afraid--though of\r\n",
      "course she might: she went because you had promised her Mr. Longdon. But\r\n",
      "I should have no more feeling about her going to you--and should expect\r\n",
      "her to have no more--than about her taking a pound of tea, as she\r\n",
      "sometimes does, to her old nurse, or her going to read to the old women\r\n",
      "at the workhouse. May you never have less to brag of!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wish she'd bring ME a pound of tea!\" Mr. Cashmore resumed. \"Or ain't\r\n",
      "I enough of an old woman for her to come and read to me at home?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Does she habitually visit the workhouse?\" Mr. Longdon enquired of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This lady kept him in a moment's suspense, which another contemplation\r\n",
      "might moreover have detected that Vanderbank in some degree shared.\r\n",
      "\"Every Friday at three.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, with a sudden turn, moved straight to one of the windows,\r\n",
      "and Mr. Cashmore had a happy remembrance. \"Why, this is Friday--she must\r\n",
      "have gone to-day. But does she stay so late?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She was to go afterwards to little Aggie: I'm trying so, in spite of\r\n",
      "difficulties,\" Mrs. Brook explained, \"to keep them on together.\" She\r\n",
      "addressed herself with a new thought to Mr. Longdon. \"You must know\r\n",
      "little Aggie--the niece of the Duchess: I forget if you've met the\r\n",
      "Duchess, but you must know HER too--there are so many things on which\r\n",
      "I'm sure she'll feel with you. Little Aggie's the one,\" she continued;\r\n",
      "\"you'll delight in her; SHE ought to have been mamma's grandchild.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dearest lady, how can you pretend or for a moment compare her--?\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Cashmore broke in. \"She says nothing to me at all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She says nothing to any one,\" Mrs. Brook serenely replied; \"that's just\r\n",
      "her type and her charm--just above all her education.\" Then she appealed\r\n",
      "to Vanderbank. \"Won't Mr. Longdon be struck with little Aggie and won't\r\n",
      "he find it interesting to talk about all that sort of thing with the\r\n",
      "Duchess?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank came back laughing, but Mr. Longdon anticipated his reply.\r\n",
      "\"What sort of thing do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Brook, \"the whole question, don't you know? of bringing\r\n",
      "girls forward or not. The question of--well, what do you call it?--their\r\n",
      "exposure. It's THE question, it appears--the question--of the future;\r\n",
      "it's awfully interesting and the Duchess at any rate is great on it.\r\n",
      "Nanda of course is exposed,\" Mrs. Brook pursued--\"fearfully.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what on earth is she exposed to?\" Mr. Cashmore gaily demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's exposed to YOU, it would seem, my dear fellow!\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "spoke with a certain discernible impatience not so much of the fact he\r\n",
      "mentioned as of the turn of their talk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It might have been in almost compassionate deprecation of this weak\r\n",
      "note that Mrs. Brookenham looked at him. Her own reply to Mr. Cashmere's\r\n",
      "question, however, was uttered at Mr. Longdon. \"She's exposed--it's much\r\n",
      "worse--to ME. But Aggie isn't exposed to anything--never has been and\r\n",
      "never is to be; and we're watching to see if the Duchess can carry it\r\n",
      "through.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not,\" asked Mr. Cashmore, \"if there's nothing she CAN be exposed to\r\n",
      "but the Duchess herself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had appealed to his companions impartially, but Mr. Longdon, whose\r\n",
      "attention was now all for his hostess, appeared unconscious. \"If you're\r\n",
      "all watching is it your idea that I should watch WITH you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The enquiry, on his lips, was a waft of cold air, the sense of which\r\n",
      "clearly led Mrs. Brook to put her invitation on the right ground. \"Not\r\n",
      "of course on the chance of anything's happening to the dear child--to\r\n",
      "whom nothing obviously CAN happen but that her aunt will marry her off\r\n",
      "in the shortest possible time and in the best possible conditions. No,\r\n",
      "the interest is much more in the way the Duchess herself steers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, she's in a boat,\" Mr. Cashmore fully concurred, \"that will take a\r\n",
      "good bit of that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not for Mr. Longdon's historian to overlook that if he was, not\r\n",
      "unnaturally, mystified he was yet also visibly interested. \"What boat is\r\n",
      "she in?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had addressed his curiosity, with politeness, to Mr. Cashmore, but\r\n",
      "they were all arrested by the wonderful way in which Mrs. Brook managed\r\n",
      "to smile at once very dimly, very darkly, and yet make it take them all\r\n",
      "in. \"I think YOU must tell him, Van.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heaven forbid!\"--and Van again retreated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'LL tell him like a shot--if you really give me leave,\" said Mr.\r\n",
      "Cashmore, for whom any scruple referred itself manifestly not to the\r\n",
      "subject of the information but to the presence of a lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I DON'T give you leave and I beg you'll hold your tongue,\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brookenham returned. \"You handle such matters with a minuteness--! In\r\n",
      "short,\" she broke off to Mr. Longdon, \"he would tell you a good\r\n",
      "deal more than you'll care to know. She IS in a boat--but she's an\r\n",
      "experienced mariner. Basta, as she would say. Do you know Mitchy?\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook suddenly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, he knows Mitchy\"--Vanderbank had approached again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then make HIM tell him\"--she put it before the young man as a charming\r\n",
      "turn for them all. \"Mitchy CAN be refined when he tries.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear--when Mitchy 'tries'!\" Vanderbank laughed. \"I think I should\r\n",
      "rather, for the job, offer him to Mr. Longdon abandoned to his native\r\n",
      "wild impulse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I LIKE Mr. Mitchett,\" the old man said, endeavouring to look his\r\n",
      "hostess straight in the eye and speaking as if somewhat to defy her to\r\n",
      "convict him, even from the point of view of Beccles, of a mistake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brookenham took it with a wonderful bright emotion. \"My dear\r\n",
      "friend, vous me rendez la vie! If you can stand Mitchy you can stand any\r\n",
      "of us!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upon my honour I should think so!\" Mr. Cashmore was eager to remark.\r\n",
      "\"What on earth do you mean,\" he demanded of Mrs. Brook, \"by saying that\r\n",
      "I'm more 'minute' than he?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned her beauty an instant on this critic. \"I don't say you're\r\n",
      "more minute--I say he's more brilliant. Besides, as I've told you\r\n",
      "before, you're not one of us.\" With which, as a check to further\r\n",
      "discussion, she went straight on to Mr. Longdon: \"The point about\r\n",
      "Aggie's conservative education is the wonderful sincerity with which\r\n",
      "the Duchess feels that one's girl may so perfectly and consistently be\r\n",
      "hedged in without one's really ever (for it comes to that) depriving\r\n",
      "one's own self--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, of what?\" Mr. Longdon boldly demanded while his hostess appeared\r\n",
      "thoughtfully to falter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She addressed herself mutely to Vanderbank, in whom the movement\r\n",
      "produced a laugh. \"I defy you,\" he exclaimed, \"to say!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you don't defy ME!\" Mr. Cashmore cried as Mrs. Brook failed to\r\n",
      "take up the challenge. \"If you know Mitchy,\" he went on to Mr. Longdon,\r\n",
      "\"you must know Petherton.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The elder man remained vague and not imperceptibly cold. \"Petherton?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My brother-in-law--whom, God knows why, Mitchy runs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Runs?\" Mr. Longdon again echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook appealed afresh to Vanderbank. \"I think we ought to spare\r\n",
      "him. I may not remind you of mamma,\" she continued to their companion,\r\n",
      "\"but I hope you don't mind my saying how much you remind me.\r\n",
      "Explanations, after all, spoil things, and if you CAN make anything of\r\n",
      "us and will sometimes come back you'll find everything in its native\r\n",
      "freshness. You'll see, you'll feel for yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon stood before her and raised to Vanderbank, when she had\r\n",
      "ceased, the eyes he had attached to the carpet while she talked. \"And\r\n",
      "must I go now?\" Explanations, she had said, spoiled things, but he might\r\n",
      "have been a stranger at an Eastern court--comically helpless without his\r\n",
      "interpreter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If Mrs. Brook desires to 'spare' you,\" Vanderbank kindly replied, \"the\r\n",
      "best way to make sure of it would perhaps indeed be to remove you. But\r\n",
      "hadn't we a hope of Nanda?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It might be of use for us to wait for her?\"--it was still to his young\r\n",
      "friend that Mr. Longdon put it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah when she's once on the loose--!\" Mrs. Brookenham sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Unless la voila,\" she said as a hand was heard at the door-latch. It\r\n",
      "was only, however, a footman who entered with a little tray that, on\r\n",
      "his approaching his mistress, offered to sight the brown envelope of\r\n",
      "a telegram. She immediately took leave to open this missive, after\r\n",
      "the quick perusal of which she had another vision of them all. \"It IS\r\n",
      "she--the modern daughter. 'Tishy keeps me dinner and opera; clothes\r\n",
      "all right; return uncertain, but if before morning have latch-key.' She\r\n",
      "won't come home till morning!\" said Mrs. Brook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But think of the comfort of the latch-key!\" Vanderbank laughed. \"You\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon appeared to have caught from Nanda's message an obscure\r\n",

      "visible intensity. \"Will you go with me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank had just debated, recalling engagements; which gave Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook time to intervene. \"Can't you live without him?\" she asked of her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank had looked at her an instant. \"I think I can get there late,\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I think _I_ can get there early,\" Mr. Cashmore declared. \"Mrs. Grendon\r\n",
      "must have a box; in fact I know which, and THEY don't,\" he jocosely\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The lower windows of the great white house, which stood high and\r\n",
      "square, opened to a wide flagged terrace, the parapet of which, an old\r\n",
      "balustrade of stone, was broken in the middle of its course by a flight\r\n",
      "of stone steps that descended to a wonderful garden. The terrace had the\r\n",
      "afternoon shade and fairly hung over the prospect that dropped away and\r\n",
      "circled it--the prospect, beyond the series of gardens, of scattered\r\n",
      "splendid trees and green glades, an horizon mainly of woods. Nanda\r\n",
      "Brookenham, one day at the end of July, coming out to find the place\r\n",
      "unoccupied as yet by other visitors, stood there a while with an air\r\n",
      "of happy possession. She moved from end to end of the terrace, pausing,\r\n",
      "gazing about her, taking in with a face that showed the pleasure of a\r\n",
      "brief independence the combination of delightful things--of old rooms\r\n",
      "with old decorations that gleamed and gloomed through the high windows,\r\n",
      "of old gardens that squared themselves in the wide angles of old walls,\r\n",
      "of wood-walks rustling in the afternoon breeze and stretching away\r\n",
      "to further reaches of solitude and summer. The scene had an expectant\r\n",
      "stillness that she was too charmed to desire to break; she watched it,\r\n",
      "listened to it, followed with her eyes the white butterflies among the\r\n",
      "flowers below her, then gave a start as the cry of a peacock came to\r\n",
      "her from an unseen alley. It set her after a minute into less difficult\r\n",
      "motion; she passed slowly down the steps, wandering further, looking\r\n",
      "back at the big bright house but pleased again to see no one else\r\n",
      "appear. If the sun was still high enough she had a pink parasol. She\r\n",
      "went through the gardens one by one, skirting the high walls that were\r\n",
      "so like \"collections\" and thinking how, later on, the nectarines and\r\n",
      "plums would flush there. She exchanged a friendly greeting with a man\r\n",
      "at work, passed through an open door and, turning this way and that,\r\n",
      "finally found herself in the park, at some distance from the house. It\r\n",
      "was a point she had had to take another rise to reach, a place marked\r\n",
      "by an old green bench for a larger sweep of the view, which, in the\r\n",
      "distance where the woods stopped, showed in the most English way in the\r\n",
      "world the colour-spot of an old red village and the tower of an old\r\n",
      "grey church. She had sunk down upon the bench almost with a sense of\r\n",
      "adventure, yet not too fluttered to wonder if it wouldn't have been\r\n",
      "happy to bring a book; the charm of which precisely would have been in\r\n",
      "feeling everything about her too beautiful to let her read.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sense of adventure grew in her, presently becoming aware of a stir\r\n",
      "in the thicket below, followed by the coming into sight, on a path that,\r\n",
      "mounting, passed near her seat, of a wanderer whom, had his particular,\r\n",
      "his exceptional identity not quickly appeared, it might have\r\n",
      "disappointed her a trifle to have to recognise as a friend. He saw her\r\n",
      "immediately, stopped, laughed, waved his hat, then bounded up the slope\r\n",
      "and, brushing his forehead with his handkerchief, confessing as to a\r\n",
      "red face, was rejoicingly there before her. Her own ejaculation on first\r\n",
      "seeing him--\"Why, Mr. Van!\"--had had an ambiguous sharpness that was\r\n",
      "rather for herself than for her visitor. She made room for him on\r\n",
      "the bench, where in a moment he was cooling off and they were both\r\n",
      "explaining. The great thing was that he had walked from the station to\r\n",
      "stretch his legs, coming far round, for the lovely hour and the pleasure\r\n",
      "of it, by a way he had learnt on some previous occasion of being at\r\n",
      "Mertle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've already stayed here then?\" Nanda, who had arrived but half\r\n",
      "an hour before, spoke as if she had lost the chance to give him a new\r\n",
      "impression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've stayed here--yes, but not with Mitchy; with some people or\r\n",
      "other--who the deuce can they have been?--who had the place for a few\r\n",
      "months a year or two ago.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you even remember?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank wondered and laughed. \"It will come to me. But it's a\r\n",
      "charming sign of London relations, isn't it?--that one CAN come down to\r\n",
      "people this way and be awfully well 'done for' and all that, and then\r\n",
      "go away and lose the whole thing, quite forget to whom one has been\r\n",
      "beholden. It's a queer life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda seemed for an instant to wish to say that one might deny the\r\n",
      "queerness, but she said something else instead. \"I suppose a man\r\n",
      "like you doesn't quite feel that he IS beholden. It's awfully good of\r\n",
      "him--it's doing a great deal for anybody--that he should come down at\r\n",
      "all; so that it would add immensely to his burden if anybody had to be\r\n",
      "remembered for it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know what you mean by a man 'like me,'\" Vanderbank returned.\r\n",
      "\"I'm not any particular kind of a man.\" She had been looking at him, but\r\n",
      "she looked away on this, and he continued good-humoured and explanatory.\r\n",
      "\"If you mean that I go about such a lot, how do you know it but by the\r\n",
      "fact that you're everywhere now yourself?--so that, whatever I am, in\r\n",
      "short, you're just as bad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You admit then that you ARE everywhere. I may be just as bad,\" the girl\r\n",
      "went on, \"but the point is that I'm not nearly so good. Girls are such\r\n",
      "natural hacks--they can't be anything else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And pray what are fellows who are in the beastly grind of fearfully\r\n",
      "busy offices? There isn't an old cabhorse in London that's kept at it,\r\n",
      "I assure you, as I am. Besides,\" the young man added, \"if I'm out every\r\n",
      "night and off somewhere like this for Sunday, can't you understand, my\r\n",
      "dear child, the fundamental reason of it?\"\r\n",

      "Nanda, with her eyes on him again, studied an instant this mystery.\r\n",
      "\"Am I to infer with delight that it's the sweet hope of meeting ME? It\r\n",

      "thank goodness--thank goodness.\" He had been looking round him, taking\r\n",
      "in the scene; he had dropped his hat on the ground and, completely at\r\n",
      "his ease, though still more wishing to show it, had crossed his legs and\r\n",
      "closely folded his arms. \"What a tremendously jolly place! If I can't\r\n",
      "for the life of me recall who they were--the other people--I've the\r\n",

      "chap if he hadn't presumed so on his gifts.'\" Vanderbank paused a\r\n",
      "minute, but his companion said nothing, and he pursued. \"It does show,\r\n",

      "that has taken place in your life in the last three months. I mean, if\r\n",

      "shake in the foot that hung down, as if everything--and what she now put\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nanda waited a little; her friend had taken out his silver case, which\r\n",

      "Vanderbank laughed and smoked. \"I take for granted he tells me\r\n",
      "everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but you scarcely take for granted _I_ do!\" She rubbed her cheek an\r\n",
      "instant with the polished silver and again the next moment turned over\r\n",
      "the case. \"This is the kind of one I should like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion glanced down at it. \"Why it holds twenty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I want one that holds twenty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank only threw out his smoke. \"I want so to give you something,\"\r\n",
      "he said at last, \"that, in my relief at lighting on an object that will\r\n",
      "do, I will, if you don't look out, give you either that or a pipe.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean this particular one?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've had it for years--but even that one if you like it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She kept it--continued to finger it. \"And by whom was it given you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this he turned to her smiling. \"You think I've forgotten that too?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly you must have forgotten, to be willing to give it away\r\n",
      "again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how do you know it was a present?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Such things always are--people don't buy them for themselves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had now relinquished the object, laying it upon the bench, and\r\n",
      "Vanderbank took it up. \"Its origin's lost in the night of time--it has\r\n",
      "no history except that I've used it. But I assure you that I do want to\r\n",
      "give you something. I've never given you anything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was silent a little. \"The exhibition you're making,\" she seriously\r\n",
      "sighed at last, \"of your inconstancy and superficiality! All the relics\r\n",
      "of you that I've treasured and that I supposed at the time to have meant\r\n",
      "something!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The 'relics'? Have you a lock of my hair?\" Then as her meaning came to\r\n",
      "him: \"Oh little Christmas things? Have you really kept them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Laid away in a drawer of their own--done up in pink paper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know what you're coming to,\" Vanderbank said. \"You've given ME\r\n",
      "things, and you're trying to convict me of having lost the sweet sense\r\n",
      "of them. But you can't do it. Where my heart's concerned I'm a walking\r\n",
      "reliquary. Pink paper? _I_ use gold paper--and the finest of all,\r\n",
      "the gold paper of the mind.\" He gave a flip with a fingernail to his\r\n",
      "cigarette and looked at its quickened fire; after which he pursued very\r\n",
      "familiarly, but with a kindness that of itself qualified the mere humour\r\n",
      "of the thing: \"Don't talk, my dear child, as if you didn't really know\r\n",
      "me for the best friend you have in the world.\" As soon as he had spoken\r\n",
      "he pulled out his watch, so that if his words had led to something of a\r\n",
      "pause this movement offered a pretext for breaking it. Nanda asked the\r\n",
      "hour and, on his replying \"Five-fifteen,\" remarked that there would now\r\n",
      "be tea on the terrace with every one gathered at it. \"Then shall we go\r\n",
      "and join them?\" her companion demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had made, however, no other motion, and when after hesitating she\r\n",
      "said \"Yes, with pleasure\" it was also without a change of position. \"I\r\n",
      "like this,\" she inconsequently added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So do I awfully. Tea on the terrace,\" Vanderbank went on, \"isn't 'in'\r\n",
      "it. But who's here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh every one. All your set.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mine? Have I still a set--with the universal vagabondism you accuse me\r\n",
      "of?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then Mitchy's--whoever they are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And nobody of yours?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" Nanda said, \"all mine. He must at least have arrived by this\r\n",
      "time. My set's Mr. Longdon,\" she explained. \"He's all of it now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then where in the world am I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you're an extra. There are always extras.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A complete set and one over?\" Vanderbank laughed. \"Where then's Tishy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Charming and grave, the girl thought a moment. \"She's in Paris with\r\n",
      "her mother--on their way to Aix-les-Bains.\" Then with impatience she\r\n",
      "continued: \"Do you know that's a great deal to say--what you said just\r\n",
      "now? I mean about your being the best friend I have.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I do, and that's exactly why I said it. You see I'm not in\r\n",
      "the least delicate or graceful or shy about it--I just come out with\r\n",
      "it and defy you to contradict me. Who, if I'm not the best, is a better\r\n",
      "one?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Nanda replied, \"I feel since I've known Mr. Longdon that I've\r\n",
      "almost the sort of friend who makes every one else not count.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then at the end of three months he has arrived at a value for you that\r\n",
      "I haven't reached in all these years?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she returned--\"the value of my not being afraid of him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, on the bench, shifted his position, turning more to her and\r\n",
      "throwing an arm over the back. \"And you're afraid of ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Horribly--hideously.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then our long, our happy relations--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're just what makes my terror,\" she broke in, \"particularly abject.\r\n",
      "Happy relations don't matter. I always think of you with fear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His elbow rested on the back and his hand supported his head. \"How\r\n",
      "awfully curious--if it be true!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had been looking away to the sweet English distance, but at this she\r\n",
      "made a movement. \"Oh Mr. Van, I'm 'true'!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Mr. Van himself couldn't have expressed at any subsequent time to any\r\n",
      "interested friend the particular effect upon him of the tone of these\r\n",
      "words his chronicler takes advantage of the fact not to pretend to a\r\n",
      "greater intelligence--to limit himself on the contrary to the\r\n",
      "simple statement that they produced in Mr. Van's cheek a flush just\r\n",
      "discernible. \"Fear of what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know. Fear is fear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes--I see.\" He took out another cigarette and occupied a moment\r\n",
      "in lighting it. \"Well, kindness is kindness too--that's all one can\r\n",
      "say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had smoked again a while before she turned to him. \"Have I wounded\r\n",
      "you by saying that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A certain effect of his flush was still in his smile. \"It seems to me\r\n",
      "I should like you to wound me. I did what I wanted a moment ago,\" he\r\n",
      "continued with some precipitation: \"I brought you out handsomely on the\r\n",
      "subject of Mr. Longdon. That was my idea--just to draw you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Nanda, looking away again, \"he has come into my life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He couldn't have come into a place where it gives me more pleasure to\r\n",
      "see him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But he didn't like, the other day when I used it to him, that\r\n",
      "expression,\" the girl returned. \"He called it 'mannered modern slang'\r\n",
      "and came back again to the extraordinary difference between my speech\r\n",
      "and my grandmother's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course,\" the young man understandingly assented. \"But I rather like\r\n",
      "your speech. Hasn't he by this time, with you,\" he pursued, \"crossed the\r\n",
      "gulf? He has with me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah with you there was no gulf. He liked you from the first.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank wondered. \"You mean I managed him so well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know how you managed him, but liking me has been for him a\r\n",
      "painful gradual process. I think he does now,\" Nanda declared. \"He\r\n",
      "accepts me at last as different--he's trying with me on that basis. He\r\n",
      "has ended by understanding that when he talks to me of Granny I can't\r\n",
      "even imagine her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank puffed away. \"I can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's what Mitchy says too. But you've both probably got her wrong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Vanderbank--\"I've gone into it a good deal. But\r\n",
      "it's too late. We can't be Greeks if we would.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even for this Nanda had no laugh, though she had a quick attention. \"Do\r\n",
      "you call Granny a Greek?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion slowly rose. \"Yes--to finish her off handsomely and have\r\n",
      "done with her.\" He looked again at his watch. \"Shall we go? I want to\r\n",
      "see if my man and my things have turned up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She kept her seat; there was something to revert to. \"My fear of you\r\n",
      "isn't superficial. I mean it isn't immediate--not of you just as you\r\n",
      "stand,\" she explained. \"It's of some dreadfully possible future you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the young man, smiling down at her, \"don't forget that\r\n",
      "if there's to be such a monster there'll also be a future you,\r\n",
      "proportionately developed, to deal with him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had closed her parasol in the shade and her eyes attached themselves\r\n",
      "to the small hole she had dug in the ground with its point. \"We shall\r\n",
      "both have moved, you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's charming to feel we shall probably have moved together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah if moving's changing,\" she returned, \"there won't be much for me in\r\n",
      "that. I shall never change--I shall be always just the same. The same\r\n",
      "old mannered modern slangy hack,\" she continued quite gravely. \"Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon has made me feel that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank laughed aloud, and it was especially at her seriousness.\r\n",
      "\"Well, upon my soul!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she pursued, \"what I am I must remain. I haven't what's called\r\n",
      "a principle of growth.\" Making marks in the earth with her umbrella she\r\n",
      "appeared to cipher it out. \"I'm about as good as I can be--and about as\r\n",
      "bad. If Mr. Longdon can't make me different nobody can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank could only speak in the tone of high amusement. \"And he has\r\n",
      "given up the hope?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--though not ME altogether. He has given up the hope he originally\r\n",
      "had.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He gives up quickly--in three months!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh these three months,\" she answered, \"have been a long time: the\r\n",
      "fullest, the most important, for what has happened in them, of my life.\"\r\n",
      "She still poked at the ground; then she added: \"And all thanks to YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To me?\"--Vanderbank couldn't fancy!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, for what we were speaking of just now--my being to-day so in\r\n",
      "everything and squeezing up and down no matter whose staircase. Isn't it\r\n",
      "one crowded hour of glorious life?\" she asked. \"What preceded it was an\r\n",
      "age, no doubt--but an age without a name.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank watched her a little in silence, then spoke quite beside\r\n",
      "the question. \"It's astonishing how at moments you remind me of your\r\n",
      "mother!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this she got up. \"Ah there it is! It's what I shall never shake off.\r\n",
      "That, I imagine, is what Mr. Longdon feels.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both on their feet now, as if ready for the others, they yet--and even\r\n",
      "a trifle awkwardly--lingered. It might in fact have appeared to a\r\n",
      "spectator that some climax had come, on the young man's part, to some\r\n",
      "state of irresolution about the utterance of something. What were the\r\n",
      "words so repeatedly on his lips, yet so repeatedly not sounded? It would\r\n",
      "have struck our observer that they were probably not those his lips\r\n",
      "even now actually formed. \"Doesn't he perhaps talk to you too much about\r\n",
      "yourself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda gave him a dim smile, and he might indeed then have exclaimed on a\r\n",
      "certain resemblance, a resemblance of expression that had nothing to\r\n",
      "do with form. It wouldn't have been diminished for him moreover by her\r\n",
      "successful suppression of every sign that she felt his question a little\r\n",
      "of a snub. The recall he had previously mentioned could, however, as she\r\n",
      "answered him, only have been brushed away by a supervening sense of his\r\n",
      "roughness. \"It probably isn't so much that as my own way of going on.\"\r\n",
      "She spoke with a mildness that could scarce have been so full without\r\n",
      "being an effort. \"Between his patience and my egotism anything's\r\n",
      "possible. It isn't his talking--it's his listening.\" She gave up the\r\n",
      "point, at any rate, as if from softness to her actual companion. \"Wasn't\r\n",
      "it you who spoke to mamma about my sitting with her? That's what I mean\r\n",
      "by my debt to you. It's through you that I'm always there--through you\r\n",
      "and perhaps a little through Mitchy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh through Mitchy--it MUST have been--more than through me.\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "spoke with the manner of humouring her about a trifle. \"Mitchy,\r\n",
      "delightful man, felt on the subject of your eternal exile, I think,\r\n",
      "still more strongly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They quitted their place together and at the end of a few steps became\r\n",
      "aware of the approach of one of the others, a figure but a few yards\r\n",
      "off, arriving from the quarter from which Nanda had come. \"Ah Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon!\"--she spoke with eagerness now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank instantly waved his hat. \"Dear old boy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Between you all, at any rate,\" she said more gaily, \"you've brought me\r\n",
      "down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank made no answer till they met their friend, when, by way of\r\n",
      "greeting, he simply echoed her words. \"Between us all, you'll be glad to\r\n",
      "know, we've brought her down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon looked from one of them to the other. \"Where have you been\r\n",
      "together?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda was the first to respond. \"Only talking--on a bench.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, _I_ want to talk on a bench!\" Their friend showed a spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Nanda praised to the satellite so fantastically described the charming\r\n",
      "spot she had quitted, with the effect that they presently took fresh\r\n",
      "possession of it, finding the beauty of the view deepened as the\r\n",
      "afternoon grew old and the shadows long. They were of a comfortable\r\n",
      "agreement on these matters, by which moreover they were but little\r\n",
      "delayed, one of the pair at least being too conscious, for the hour, of\r\n",
      "still other phenomena than the natural and peaceful process that filled\r\n",
      "the air. \"Well, you must tell me about these things,\" Mr. Longdon\r\n",
      "sociably said: he had joined his young friend with a budget of\r\n",

      "he could allow for most differences; yet in such a situation as the\r\n",
      "present bewilderment could only come back. There were no differences in\r\n",
      "the world--so it had all ended for him--but those that marked at every\r\n",
      "turn the manners he had for three months been observing in good society.\r\n",
      "The general wide deviation of this body occupied his mind to the\r\n",
      "exclusion of almost everything else, and he had finally been brought to\r\n",
      "believe that even in his slow-paced prime he must have hung behind his\r\n",
      "contemporaries. He had not supposed at the moment--in the fifties and\r\n",
      "the sixties--that he passed for old-fashioned, but life couldn't have\r\n",
      "left him so far in the rear had the start between them originally been\r\n",
      "fair. This was the way he had more than once put the matter to the girl;\r\n",
      "which gives a sufficient hint, it is hoped, of the range of some\r\n",
      "of their talk. It had always wound up indeed, their talk, with some\r\n",
      "assumption of the growth of his actual understanding; but it was just\r\n",
      "these pauses in the fray that seemed to lead from time to time to a\r\n",
      "sharper clash. It was apt to be when he felt as if he had exhausted\r\n",
      "surprises that he really received his greatest shocks. There were no\r\n",
      "such queer-tasting draughts as some of those yielded by the bucket that\r\n",
      "had repeatedly, as he imagined, touched the bottom of the well. \"Now\r\n",

      "That's the way\"--and with his eyes on the golden distance he ingeniously\r\n",
      "followed it out--\"I come to feel so the lurching and pitching. If I\r\n",
      "weren't a pretty fair sailor--well, as it is, my dear,\" he interrupted\r\n",
      "himself with a laugh, \"I show you often enough what grabs I make for\r\n",
      "support.\" He gave a faint gasp, half amusement, half anguish, then\r\n",
      "abruptly relieved himself by a question. \"To whom in point of fact does\r\n",
      "the place belong?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm awfully ashamed, but I'm afraid I don't know. That just came up\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon seemed to think an instant. \"Oh it came up, did it? And Mr.\r\n",
      "Van couldn't tell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has quite forgotten--though he has been here before. Of course it\r\n",
      "may have been with other people,\" she added in extenuation. \"I mean it\r\n",
      "mayn't have been theirs then any more than it's Mitchy's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see. They too had just bundled in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda completed the simple history. \"To-day it's Mitchy who bundles, and\r\n",
      "I believe that really he bundled only yesterday. He turned in his people\r\n",
      "and here we are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here we are, here we are!\" her friend more gravely echoed. \"Well, it's\r\n",
      "splendid!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As if at a note in his voice her eyes, while his own still strayed\r\n",
      "away, just fixed him. \"Don't you think it's really rather exciting?\r\n",
      "Everything's ready, the feast all spread, and with nothing to blunt\r\n",
      "our curiosity but the general knowledge that there will be people\r\n",
      "and things--with nothing but that we comfortably take our places.\" He\r\n",
      "answered nothing, though her picture apparently reached him. \"There ARE\r\n",
      "people, there ARE things, and all in a plenty. Had every one, when you\r\n",
      "came away, turned up?\" she asked as he was still silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I dare say. There were some ladies and gentlemen on the terrace whom\r\n",
      "I didn't know. But I looked only for you and came this way on an\r\n",
      "indication of your mother's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And did she ask that if you should find me with Mr. Van you'd make him\r\n",
      "come to her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon replied to this with some delay and without movement. \"How\r\n",
      "could she have supposed he was here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Since he had not yet been to the house? Oh it has always been a wonder\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon candidly considered. \"Oh I take him up on all sorts of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"That shows then the importance they have for you. Is HE like his\r\n",

      "\"Wasn't it his grandmother too you knew?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had an extraordinary smile. \"His mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She exclaimed, colouring, on her mistake, and he added: \"I'm not so bad\r\n",
      "as that. But you're none of you like them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wasn't she pretty?\" Nanda asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very handsome. But it makes no difference. She herself to-day wouldn't\r\n",
      "know him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She gave a small gasp. \"His own mother wouldn't--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His headshake just failed of sharpness. \"No, nor he her. There's a link\r\n",
      "missing.\" Then as if after all she might take him too seriously, \"Of\r\n",
      "course it's I,\" he more gently moralised, \"who have lost the link in my\r\n",
      "sleep. I've slept half the century--I'm Rip Van Winkle.\" He went back\r\n",
      "after a moment to her question. \"He's not at any rate like his mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned it over. \"Perhaps you wouldn't think so much of her now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps not. At all events my snatching you from Mr. Vanderbank was my\r\n",
      "own idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wasn't thinking,\" Nanda said, \"of your snatching me. I was thinking\r\n",
      "of your snatching yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I might have sent YOU to the house? Well,\" Mr. Longdon replied, \"I find\r\n",
      "I take more and more the economical view of my pleasures. I run them\r\n",
      "less and less together. I get all I can out of each.\"\r\n",

      "\"So now you're getting all you can out of ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All I can, my dear--all I can.\" He watched a little the flushed\r\n",
      "distance, then mildly broke out: \"It IS, as you said just now, exciting!\r\n",
      "But it makes me\"--and he became abrupt again--\"want you, as I've already\r\n",
      "told you, to come to MY place. Not, however, that we may be still more\r\n",
      "mad together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl shared from the bench his contemplation. \"Do you call THIS\r\n",
      "madness?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, he rather stuck to it. \"You spoke of it yourself as excitement.\r\n",
      "You'll make of course one of your fine distinctions, but I take it in my\r\n",
      "rough way as a whirl. We're going round and round.\" In a minute he had\r\n",
      "folded his arms with the same closeness Vanderbank had used--in a minute\r\n",
      "he too was nervously shaking his foot. \"Steady, steady; if we sit close\r\n",
      "we shall see it through. But come down to Suffolk for sanity.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You do mean then that I may come alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I won't receive you, I assure you, on any other terms. I want to show\r\n",
      "you,\" he continued, \"what life CAN give. Not of course,\" he subjoined,\r\n",
      "\"of this sort of thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--you've told me. Of peace.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of peace,\" said Mr. Longdon. \"Oh you don't know--you haven't the least\r\n",
      "idea. That's just why I want to show you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda looked as if already she saw it in the distance. \"But will it be\r\n",
      "peace if I'm there? I mean for YOU,\" she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It isn't a question of 'me.' Everybody's omelet is made of somebody's\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He had dropped for so long that she wondered. \"Well, when we are--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, it will be all right,\" he simply concluded. \"Temples of peace, the\r\n",
      "ancients used to call them. We'll set up one, and I shall be at least\r\n",
      "doorkeeper. You'll come down whenever you like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She gave herself to him in her silence more than she could have done in\r\n",
      "words. \"Have you arranged it with mamma?\" she said, however, at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've arranged everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"SHE won't want to come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her friend's laugh turned him to her. \"Don't be nervous. There are\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But others as to which not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their eyes met for some time on this, and it ended in his saying: \"Well,\r\n",
      "you must help me.\" Nanda, but without shrinking, looked away again, and\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, as if to consecrate their understanding by the air of ease,\r\n",
      "passed to another subject. \"Mr. Mitchett's the most princely host.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't he too kind for anything? Do you know what he pretends?\" Nanda\r\n",
      "went on. \"He says in the most extraordinary way that he does it all for\r\n",
      "ME.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Takes this great place and fills it with servants and company--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, just so that I may come down for a Sunday or two. Of course he\r\n",
      "has only taken it for three or four weeks, but even for that time it's\r\n",
      "a handsome compliment. He doesn't care what he does. It's his way of\r\n",
      "amusing himself. He amuses himself at our expense,\" the girl continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I hope that makes up, my dear, for the rate at which we're doing\r\n",
      "so at his!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His amusement,\" said Nanda, \"is to see us believe what he says.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon thought a moment. \"Really, my child, you're most acute.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I haven't watched life for nothing! Mitchy doesn't care,\" she\r\n",
      "repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion seemed divided between a desire to draw and a certain fear\r\n",
      "to encourage her. \"Doesn't care for what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She considered an instant, all coherently, and it might have added to\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's impression of her depth. \"Well, for himself. I mean for\r\n",
      "his money. For anything any one may think. For Lord Petherton,\r\n",
      "for instance, really at all. Lord Petherton thinks he has helped\r\n",
      "him--thinks, that is, that Mitchy thinks he has. But Mitchy's more\r\n",
      "amused at HIM than at anybody else. He takes every one in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Every one but you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I like him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My poor child, you're of a profundity!\" Mr. Longdon murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He spoke almost uneasily, but she was not too much alarmed to continue\r\n",
      "lucid. \"And he likes me, and I know just how much--and just how little.\r\n",
      "He's the most generous man in the world. It pleases him to feel that\r\n",
      "he's indifferent and splendid--there are so many things it makes up\r\n",
      "to him for.\" The old man listened with attention, and his young friend\r\n",
      "conscious of it, proceeded as on ground of which she knew every inch.\r\n",
      "\"He's the son, as you know, of a great bootmaker--'to all the Courts of\r\n",
      "Europe'--who left him a large fortune, which had been made, I believe,\r\n",
      "in the most extraordinary way, by building-speculations as well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I know. It's astonishing!\" her companion sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That he should be of such extraction?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, everything. That you should be talking as you are--that you\r\n",
      "should have 'watched life,' as you say, to such purpose. That we should\r\n",
      "any of us be here--most of all that Mr. Mitchett himself should. That\r\n",
      "your grandmother's daughter should have brought HER daughter--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To stay with a person\"--Nanda took it up as, apparently out of\r\n",
      "delicacy, he fairly failed--\"whose father used to take the measure,\r\n",
      "down on his knees on a little mat, as mamma says, of my grandfather's\r\n",
      "remarkably large foot? Yes, we none of us mind. Do you think we should?\"\r\n",
      "Nanda asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon turned it over. \"I'll answer you by a question. Would you\r\n",
      "marry him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never.\" Then as if to show there was no weakness in her mildness,\r\n",
      "\"Never, never, never,\" she repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet I dare say you know--?\" But Mr. Longdon once more faltered; his\r\n",
      "scruple came uppermost. \"You don't mind my speaking of it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of his thinking he wants to marry me? Not a bit. I positively enjoy\r\n",
      "telling you there's nothing in it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not even for HIM?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda considered. \"Not more than is made up to him by his having\r\n",
      "found out through talks and things--which mightn't otherwise have\r\n",
      "occurred--that I do like him. I wouldn't have come down here if I hadn't\r\n",
      "liked him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not for any other reason?\"--Mr. Longdon put it gravely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not for YOUR being here, do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He delayed. \"Me and other persons.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She showed somehow that she wouldn't flinch. \"You weren't asked till\r\n",
      "after he had made sure I'd come. We've become, you and I,\" she smiled,\r\n",
      "\"one of the couples who are invited together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These were couples, his speculative eye seemed to show, he didn't even\r\n",
      "yet know about, and if he mentally took them up a moment it was all\r\n",
      "promptly to drop them. \"I don't think you state it quite strongly\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"That Mitchy IS hard hit? He states it so strongly himself that it\r\n",
      "will surely do for both of us. I'm a part of what I just spoke of--his\r\n",
      "indifference and magnificence. It's as if he could only afford to do\r\n",
      "what's not vulgar. He might perfectly marry a duke's daughter, but that\r\n",
      "WOULD be vulgar--would be the absolute necessity and ideal of nine out\r\n",
      "of ten of the sons of shoemakers made ambitious by riches. Mitchy says\r\n",
      "'No; I take my own line; I go in for a beggar-maid.' And it's only\r\n",
      "because I'm a beggar-maid that he wants me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But there are plenty of other beggar-maids,\" Mr. Longdon objected.\r\n",

      "Nanda went on, \"or if I were really good-looking--for that to-day, the\r\n",
      "real thing, will do as well as being a duke's daughter--he wouldn't come\r\n",
      "near me. And I think that ought to settle it. Besides, he must marry\r\n",
      "Aggie. She's a beggar-maid too--as well as an angel. So there's nothing\r\n",
      "against it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon stared, but even in his surprise seemed to take from\r\n",
      "the swiftness with which she made him move over the ground a certain\r\n",
      "agreeable glow. \"Does 'Aggie' like him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She likes every one. As I say, she's an angel--but a real, real, real\r\n",
      "one. The kindest man in the world's therefore the proper husband for\r\n",
      "her. If Mitchy wants to do something thoroughly nice,\" she declared with\r\n",
      "the same high competence, \"he'll take her out of her situation, which is\r\n",
      "awful.\"\r\n",

      "Mr. Longdon looked graver. \"In what way awful?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, don't you know?\" His eye was now cold enough to give her, in her\r\n",
      "chill, a flurried sense that she might displease him least by a graceful\r\n",
      "lightness. \"The Duchess and Lord Petherton are like you and me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it a conundrum?\" He was serious indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're one of the couples who are invited together.\" But his face\r\n",
      "reflected so little success for her levity that it was in another tone\r\n",
      "she presently added: \"Mitchy really oughtn't.\" Her friend, in silence,\r\n",
      "fixed his eyes on the ground; an attitude in which there was something\r\n",
      "to make her strike rather wild. \"But of course, kind as he is, he can\r\n",
      "scarcely be called particular. He has his ideas--he thinks nothing\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon remained mute a while, and when he at last, raised his eyes\r\n",

      "of everything? One might easily receive that impression.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He again became mute, and there was a pause between them of some length,\r\n",
      "accepted by Nanda with an anxious stillness that it might have touched a\r\n",
      "spectator to observe. She sat there as if waiting for some further sign,\r\n",
      "only wanting not to displease her friend, yet unable to pretend to play\r\n",
      "any part and with something in her really that she couldn't take back\r\n",
      "now, something involved in her original assumption that there was to\r\n",
      "be a kind of intelligence in their relation. \"I dare say,\" she said at\r\n",
      "last, \"that I make allusions you don't like. But I keep forgetting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waited a moment longer, then turned to her with a look rendered a\r\n",
      "trifle strange by the way it happened to reach over his glasses. It was\r\n",
      "even austerer than before. \"Keep forgetting what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She gave after an instant a faint feeble smile which seemed to speak of\r\n",
      "helplessness and which, when at rare moments it played in her face, was\r\n",
      "expressive from her positive lack of personal, superficial diffidence.\r\n",
      "\"Well--I don't know.\" It was as if appearances became at times\r\n",
      "so complicated that--so far as helping others to understand was\r\n",
      "concerned--she could only give up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hope you don't think I want you to be with me as you wouldn't be--so\r\n",

      "be frank. If you were to try to APPEAR to me anything--!\" He ended in\r\n",
      "simple sadness: that, for instance, would be so little what he should\r\n",
      "like.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Anything different, you mean, from what I am? That's just what I've\r\n",
      "thought from the first. One's just what one IS--isn't one? I don't mean\r\n",
      "so much,\" she went on, \"in one's character or temper--for they have,\r\n",
      "haven't they? to be what's called 'properly controlled'--as in one's\r\n",

      "nasty and underhand, which you naturally don't want, nor I either.\r\n",
      "Nevertheless when I say the things she wouldn't, then I put before you\r\n",
      "too much--too much for your liking it--what I know and see and feel. If\r\n",
      "we're both partly the result of other people, HER other people were\r\n",
      "so different.\" The girl's sensitive boldness kept it up, but there was\r\n",
      "something in her that pleaded for patience. \"And yet if she had YOU, so\r\n",
      "I've got you too. It's the flattery of that, or the sound of it, I know,\r\n",
      "that must be so unlike her. Of course it's awfully like mother; yet it\r\n",
      "isn't as if you hadn't already let me see--is it?--that you don't really\r\n",
      "think me the same.\" Again she stopped a minute, as to find her scarce\r\n",
      "possible way with him, and again for the time he gave no sign. She\r\n",
      "struck out once more with her strange cool limpidity. \"Granny wasn't the\r\n",
      "kind of girl she COULDN't be--and so neither am I.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had fallen while she talked into something that might have\r\n",
      "been taken for a conscious temporary submission to her; he had uncrossed\r\n",
      "his fidgety legs and, thrusting them out with the feet together, sat\r\n",
      "looking very hard before him, his chin sunk on his breast and his hands,\r\n",
      "clasped as they met, rapidly twirling their thumbs. So he remained for\r\n",
      "a time that might have given his young friend the sense of having made\r\n",
      "herself right for him so far as she had been wrong. He still had all her\r\n",
      "attention, just as previously she had had his, but, while he now simply\r\n",
      "gazed and thought, she watched him with a discreet solicitude that would\r\n",
      "almost have represented him as a near relative whom she supposed unwell.\r\n",
      "At the end he looked round, and then, obeying some impulse that had\r\n",
      "gathered in her while they sat mute, she put out to him the tender hand\r\n",
      "she might have offered to a sick child. They had been talking about\r\n",
      "frankness, but she showed a frankness in this instance that made him\r\n",
      "perceptibly colour. To that in turn, however, he responded only the more\r\n",
      "completely, taking her hand and holding it, keeping it a long minute\r\n",
      "during which their eyes met and something seemed to clear up that had\r\n",
      "been too obscure to be dispelled by words. Finally he brought out as\r\n",
      "if, though it was what he had been thinking of, her gesture had most\r\n",
      "determined him: \"I wish immensely you'd get married!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His tone betrayed so special a meaning that the words had a sound of\r\n",
      "suddenness; yet there was always in Nanda's face that odd preparedness\r\n",
      "of the young person who has unlearned surprise through the habit, in\r\n",
      "company, of studiously not compromising her innocence by blinking at\r\n",
      "things said. \"How CAN I?\" she asked, but appearing rather to take up the\r\n",
      "proposal than to put it by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can't you, CAN'T you?\" He spoke pressingly and kept her hand. She shook\r\n",
      "her head slowly, markedly; on which he continued: \"You don't do justice\r\n",
      "to Mr. Mitchy.\" She said nothing, but her look was there and it made him\r\n",
      "resume: \"Impossible?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Impossible.\" At this, letting her go, Mr. Longden got up; he pulled out\r\n",
      "his watch. \"We must go back.\" She had risen with him and they stood face\r\n",
      "to face in the faded light while he slipped the watch away. \"Well, that\r\n",
      "doesn't make me wish it any less.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's lovely of you to wish it, but I shall be one of the people who\r\n",
      "don't. I shall be at the end,\" said Nanda, \"one of those who haven't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, my child,\" he returned gravely--\"you shall never be anything so\r\n",
      "sad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not--if YOU'VE been?\" He looked at her a little, quietly, and then,\r\n",
      "putting out his hand, passed her own into his arm. \"Exactly because I\r\n",
      "have.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Would you\" the Duchess said to him the next day, \"be for five minutes\r\n",
      "awfully kind to my poor little niece?\" The words were spoken in charming\r\n",
      "entreaty as he issued from the house late on the Sunday afternoon--the\r\n",
      "second evening of his stay, which the next morning was to bring to an\r\n",
      "end--and on his meeting the speaker at one of the extremities of the\r\n",
      "wide cool terrace. There was at this point a subsidiary flight of steps\r\n",
      "by which she had just mounted from the grounds, one of her purposes\r\n",
      "being apparently to testify afresh to the anxious supervision of little\r\n",
      "Aggie she had momentarily suffered herself to be diverted from. This\r\n",
      "young lady, established in the pleasant shade on a sofa of light\r\n",
      "construction designed for the open air, offered the image of a patience\r\n",
      "of which it was a questionable kindness to break the spell. It was that\r\n",
      "beautiful hour when, toward the close of the happiest days of summer,\r\n",
      "such places as the great terrace at Mertle present to the fancy a recall\r\n",
      "of the banquet-hall deserted--deserted by the company lately gathered at\r\n",
      "tea and now dispersed, according to affinities and combinations promptly\r\n",
      "felt and perhaps quite as promptly criticised, either in quieter\r\n",
      "chambers where intimacy might deepen or in gardens and under trees where\r\n",
      "the stillness knew the click of balls and the good humour of games.\r\n",
      "There had been chairs, on the terrace, pushed about; there were\r\n",
      "ungathered teacups on the level top of the parapet; the servants in\r\n",
      "fact, in the manner of \"hands\" mustered by a whistle on the deck of a\r\n",
      "ship, had just arrived to restore things to an order soon again to be\r\n",
      "broken. There were scattered couples in sight below and an idle group\r\n",
      "on the lawn, out of the midst of which, in spite of its detachment,\r\n",
      "somebody was sharp enough sometimes to cry \"Out!\" The high daylight was\r\n",
      "still in the sky, but with just the foreknowledge already of the long\r\n",
      "golden glow in which the many-voiced caw of the rooks would sound at\r\n",
      "once sociable and sad. There was a great deal all about to be aware of\r\n",
      "and to look at, but little Aggie had her eyes on a book over which her\r\n",
      "pretty head was bent with a docility visible even from afar. \"I've a\r\n",
      "friend--down there by the lake--to go back to,\" the Duchess went on,\r\n",
      "\"and I'm on my way to my room to get a letter that I've promised to show\r\n",
      "him. I shall immediately bring it down and then in a few minutes be\r\n",
      "able to relieve you,--I don't leave her alone too much--one doesn't, you\r\n",
      "know, in a house full of people, a child of that age. Besides\"--and Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon's interlocutress was even more confiding--\"I do want you so very\r\n",
      "intensely to know her. You, par exemple, you're what I SHOULD like to\r\n",
      "give her.\" Mr. Longdon looked the noble lady, in acknowledgement of her\r\n",
      "appeal, straight in the face, and who can tell whether or no she acutely\r\n",
      "guessed from his expression that he recognised this particular juncture\r\n",
      "as written on the page of his doom?--whether she heard him inaudibly\r\n",
      "say \"Ah here it is: I knew it would have to come!\" She would at any rate\r\n",
      "have been astute enough, had this miracle occurred, quite to complete\r\n",
      "his sense for her own understanding and suffer it to make no difference\r\n",
      "in the tone in which she still confronted him. \"Oh I take the bull by\r\n",
      "the horns--I know you haven't wanted to know me. If you had you'd have\r\n",
      "called on me--I've given you plenty of hints and little coughs. Now, you\r\n",
      "see, I don't cough any more--I just rush at you and grab you. You don't\r\n",
      "call on me--so I call on YOU. There isn't any indecency moreover that I\r\n",
      "won't commit for my child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's impenetrability crashed like glass at the elbow-touch\r\n",
      "of this large handsome practised woman, who walked for him, like some\r\n",
      "brazen pagan goddess, in a cloud of queer legend. He looked off at her\r\n",
      "child, who, at a distance and not hearing them, had not moved. \"I know\r\n",
      "she's a great friend of Nanda's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has Nanda told you that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Often--taking such an interest in her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm glad she thinks so then--though really her interests are so\r\n",
      "various. But come to my baby. I don't make HER come,\" she explained as\r\n",
      "she swept him along, \"because I want you just to sit down by her there\r\n",
      "and keep the place, as one may say--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, for whom?\" he demanded as she stopped. It was her step that had\r\n",
      "checked itself as well as her tongue, and again, suddenly, they stood\r\n",
      "quite consciously and vividly opposed. \"Can I trust you?\" the Duchess\r\n",
      "brought out. Again then she took herself up. \"But as if I weren't\r\n",
      "already doing it! It's because I do trust you so utterly that I haven't\r\n",
      "been able any longer to keep my hands off you. The person I want the\r\n",
      "place for is none other than Mitchy himself, and half my occupation now\r\n",
      "is to get it properly kept for him. Lord Petherton's immensely kind, but\r\n",
      "Lord Petherton can't do everything. I know you really like our host--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, at this, interrupted her with a certain coldness. \"How, may\r\n",
      "I ask, do you know it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But with a brazen goddess to deal with--! This personage had to fix him\r\n",
      "but an instant. \"Because, you dear honest man, you're here. You wouldn't\r\n",
      "be if you hated him, for you don't practically condone--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time he broke in with his eyes on the child. \"I feel on the\r\n",
      "contrary, I assure you, that I condone a great deal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, don't boast of your cynicism,\" she laughed, \"till you're sure of\r\n",
      "all it covers. Let the right thing for you be,\" she went on, \"that Nanda\r\n",
      "herself wants it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nanda herself?\" He continued to watch little Aggie, who had never yet\r\n",
      "turned her head. \"I'm afraid I don't understand you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She swept him on again. \"I'll come to you presently and explain. I MUST\r\n",
      "get my letter for Petherton; after which I'll give up Mitchy, whom I was\r\n",
      "going to find, and since I've broken the ice--if it isn't too much to\r\n",
      "say to such a polar bear!--I'll show you le fond de ma pensee. Baby\r\n",
      "darling,\" she said to her niece, \"keep Mr. Longdon. Show him,\" she\r\n",
      "benevolently suggested, \"what you've been reading.\" Then again to her\r\n",
      "fellow guest, as arrested by this very question: \"Caro signore, have YOU\r\n",
      "a possible book?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Little Aggie had got straight up and was holding out her volume, which\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, all courtesy for her, glanced at. \"Stories from English\r\n",
      "History. Oh!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His ejaculation, though vague, was not such as to prevent the girl from\r\n",
      "venturing gently: \"Have you read it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, receiving her pure little smile, showed he felt he had\r\n",
      "never so taken her in as at this moment, as well as also that she was a\r\n",
      "person with whom he should surely get on. \"I think I must have.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Little Aggie was still more encouraged, but not to the point of keeping\r\n",
      "anything back. \"It hasn't any author. It's anonymous.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess borrowed, for another question to Mr. Longdon, not a little\r\n",
      "of her gravity. \"Is it all right?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know\"--his answer was to Aggie. \"There have been some horrid\r\n",
      "things in English history.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh horrid--HAVEN'T there?\" Aggie, whose speech had the prettiest\r\n",
      "faintest foreignness, sweetly and eagerly quavered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, darling, Mr. Longdon will recommend to you some nice historical\r\n",
      "work--for we love history, don't we?--that leaves the horrors out. We\r\n",
      "like to know,\" the Duchess explained to the authority she invoked, \"the\r\n",
      "cheerful happy RIGHT things. There are so many, after all, and this is\r\n",
      "the place to remember them. A tantot.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she passed into the house by the nearest of the long windows that\r\n",
      "stood open Mr. Longdon placed himself beside her little charge, whom he\r\n",
      "treated, for the next ten minutes, with an exquisite courtesy. A person\r\n",
      "who knew him well would, if present at the scene, have found occasion\r\n",
      "in it to be freshly aware that he was in his quiet way master of two\r\n",
      "distinct kinds of urbanity, the kind that added to distance and the kind\r\n",
      "that diminished it. Such an analyst would furthermore have noted, in\r\n",
      "respect to the aunt and the niece, of which kind each had the benefit,\r\n",
      "and might even have gone so far as to detect in him some absolute\r\n",
      "betrayal of the impression produced on him by his actual companion, some\r\n",
      "irradiation of his certitude that, from the point of view under which\r\n",
      "she had been formed, she was a remarkable, a rare success. Since to\r\n",
      "create a particular little rounded and tinted innocence had been aimed\r\n",
      "at, the fruit had been grown to the perfection of a peach on a sheltered\r\n",
      "wall, and this quality of the object resulting from a process might well\r\n",
      "make him feel himself in contact with something wholly new. Little Aggie\r\n",
      "differed from any young person he had ever met in that she had been\r\n",
      "deliberately prepared for consumption and in that furthermore the\r\n",
      "gentleness of her spirit had immensely helped the preparation. Nanda,\r\n",
      "beside her, was a Northern savage, and the reason was partly that the\r\n",
      "elements of that young lady's nature were already, were publicly, were\r\n",
      "almost indecorously active. They were practically there for good or for\r\n",
      "ill; experience was still to come and what they might work out to still\r\n",
      "a mystery; but the sum would get itself done with the figures now on the\r\n",
      "slate. On little Aggie's slate the figures were yet to be written; which\r\n",
      "sufficiently accounted for the difference of the two surfaces. Both\r\n",
      "the girls struck him as lambs with the great shambles of life in\r\n",
      "their future; but while one, with its neck in a pink ribbon, had no\r\n",
      "consciousness but that of being fed from the hand with the small sweet\r\n",
      "biscuit of unobjectionable knowledge, the other struggled with instincts\r\n",
      "and forebodings, with the suspicion of its doom and the far-borne scent,\r\n",
      "in the flowery fields, of blood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Nanda, she's my best friend after three or four others.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"After so many?\" Mr. Longdon laughed. \"Don't you think that's rather a\r\n",
      "back seat, as they say, for one's best?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A back seat?\"--she wondered with a purity!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you don't understand,\" said her companion, \"it serves me right, as\r\n",
      "your aunt didn't leave me with you to teach you the slang of the day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The 'slang'?\"--she again spotlessly speculated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've never even heard the expression? I should think that a great\r\n",
      "compliment to our time if it weren't that I fear it may have been only\r\n",
      "the name that has been kept from you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The light of ignorance in the child's smile was positively golden. \"The\r\n",
      "name?\" she again echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She understood too little--he gave it up. \"And who are all the other\r\n",
      "best friends whom poor Nanda comes after?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, there's my aunt, and Miss Merriman, and Gelsomina, and Dr.\r\n",
      "Beltram.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And who, please, is Miss Merriman?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's my governess, don't you know?--but such a deliciously easy\r\n",
      "governess.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That, I suppose, is because she has such a deliciously easy pupil. And\r\n",
      "who is Gelsomina?\" Mr. Longdon enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's my old nurse--my old maid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see. Well, one must always be kind to old maids. But who's Dr.\r\n",
      "Beltram?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh the most intimate friend of all. We tell him everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was for Mr. Longdon in this, with a slight incertitude, an effect\r\n",
      "of drollery. \"Your little troubles?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah they're not always so little! And he takes them all away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Always?--on the spot?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sooner or later,\" said little Aggie with serenity. \"But why not?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not indeed?\" he laughed. \"It must be very plain sailing.\" Decidedly\r\n",
      "she was, as Nanda had said, an angel, and there was a wonder in her\r\n",
      "possession on this footing of one of the most expressive little faces\r\n",
      "that even her expressive race had ever shown him. Formed to express\r\n",
      "everything, it scarce expressed as yet even a consciousness. All the\r\n",
      "elements of play were in it, but they had nothing to play with. It was a\r\n",
      "rest moreover, after so much that he had lately been through, to be with\r\n",
      "a person for whom questions were so simple. \"But he sounds all the same\r\n",
      "like the kind of doctor whom, as soon as one hears of him, one wants to\r\n",
      "send for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young girl had at this a small light of confusion. \"Oh I don't mean\r\n",
      "he's a doctor for medicine. He's a clergyman--and my aunt says he's a\r\n",
      "saint. I don't think you've many in England,\" little Aggie continued to\r\n",
      "explain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Many saints? I'm afraid not. Your aunt's very happy to know one. We\r\n",
      "should call Dr. Beltram in England a priest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but he's English. And he knows everything we do--and everything we\r\n",
      "think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'We'--your aunt, your governess and your nurse? What a varied wealth of\r\n",
      "knowledge!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah Miss Merriman and Gelsomina tell him only what they like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And do you and the Duchess tell him what you DON'T like?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh often--but we always like HIM--no matter what we tell him. And we\r\n",
      "know that just the same he always likes us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see then of course,\" said Mr. Longdon, very gravely now, \"what a\r\n",
      "friend he must be. So it's after all this,\" he continued in a moment,\r\n",
      "\"that Nanda comes in?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion had to consider, but suddenly she caught assistance. \"This\r\n",
      "one, I think, comes before.\" Lord Petherton, arriving apparently from\r\n",
      "the garden, had drawn near unobserved by Mr. Longdon and the next moment\r\n",
      "was within hail. \"I see him very often,\" she continued--\"oftener\r\n",
      "than Nanda. Oh but THEN Nanda. And then,\" little Aggie wound up, \"Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'm glad HE comes in,\" Mr. Longdon returned, \"though rather far down\r\n",
      "in the list.\" Lord Petherton was now before them, there being no one\r\n",
      "else on the terrace to speak to, and, with the odd look of an excess of\r\n",
      "physical power that almost blocked the way, he seemed to give them in\r\n",
      "the flare of his big teeth the benefit of a kind of brutal geniality.\r\n",
      "It was always to be remembered for him that he could scarce show without\r\n",
      "surprising you an adjustment to the smaller conveniences; so that when\r\n",
      "he took up a trifle it was not perforce in every case the sign of an\r\n",
      "uncanny calculation. When the elephant in the show plays the fiddle it\r\n",
      "must be mainly with the presumption of consequent apples; which was\r\n",
      "why, doubtless, this personage had half the time the air of assuring\r\n",
      "you that, really civilised as his type had now become, no apples were\r\n",
      "required. Mr. Longdon viewed him with a vague apprehension and as if\r\n",
      "quite unable to meet the question of what he would have called for such\r\n",
      "a personage the social responsibility. Did this specimen of his class\r\n",
      "pull the tradition down or did he just take it where he found it--in the\r\n",
      "very different place from that in which, on ceasing so long ago to \"go\r\n",
      "out,\" Mr. Longdon had left it? Our friend doubtless averted himself\r\n",
      "from the possibility of a mental dilemma; if the man didn't lower the\r\n",
      "position was it the position then that let down the man? Somehow he\r\n",
      "wasn't positively up. More evidence would be needed to decide; yet\r\n",
      "it was just of more evidence that one remained rather in dread. Lord\r\n",
      "Petherton was kind to little Aggie, kind to her companion, kind to\r\n",
      "every one, after Mr. Longdon had explained that she was so good as to be\r\n",
      "giving him the list of her dear friends. \"I'm only a little dismayed,\"\r\n",
      "the elder man said, \"to find Mr. Mitchett at the bottom.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but it's an awfully short list, isn't it? If it consists only of\r\n",
      "me and Mitchy he's not so very low down. We don't allow her very MANY\r\n",
      "friends; we look out too well for ourselves.\" He addressed the child\r\n",
      "as on an easy jocose understanding. \"Is the question, Aggie, whether we\r\n",
      "shall allow you Mr. Longdon? Won't that rather 'do' for us--for Mitchy\r\n",
      "and me? I say, Duchess,\" he went on as this lady reappeared, \"ARE we\r\n",
      "going to allow her Mr. Longdon and do we quite realise what we're about?\r\n",
      "We mount guard awfully, you know\"--he carried the joke back to the\r\n",
      "person he had named. \"We sift and we sort, we pick the candidates over,\r\n",
      "and I should like to hear any one say that in this case at least I don't\r\n",
      "keep a watch on my taste. Oh we close in!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess, the object of her quest in her hand, had come back. \"Well\r\n",
      "then Mr. Longdon will close WITH us--you'll consider henceforth that\r\n",
      "he's as safe as yourself. Here's the letter I wanted you to read--with\r\n",
      "which you'll please take a turn, in strict charge of the child, and then\r\n",
      "restore her to us. If you don't come I shall know you've found Mitchy\r\n",
      "and shall be at peace. Go, little heart,\" she continued to the child,\r\n",
      "\"but leave me your book to look over again. I don't know that I'm quite\r\n",
      "sure!\" She sent them off together, but had a grave protest as her friend\r\n",
      "put out his hand for the volume. \"No, Petherton--not for books; for her\r\n",
      "reading I can't say I do trust you. But for everything else--quite!\" she\r\n",
      "declared to Mr. Longdon with a look of conscientious courage as their\r\n",
      "companion withdrew. \"I do believe,\" she pursued in the same spirit, \"in\r\n",
      "a certain amount of intelligent confidence. Really nice men are steadied\r\n",
      "by the sense of your having had it. But I wouldn't,\" she added gaily,\r\n",

      "Many things at Mertle were strange for her interlocutor, but nothing\r\n",
      "perhaps as yet had been so strange as the sight of this arrangement for\r\n",
      "little Aggie's protection; an arrangement made in the interest of her\r\n",
      "remaining as a young person of her age and her monde--so her aunt would\r\n",
      "have put it--should remain. The strangest part of the impression too\r\n",
      "was that the provision might really have its happy side and his lordship\r\n",
      "understand definitely better than any one else his noble friend's whole\r\n",
      "theory of perils and precautions. The child herself, the spectator of\r\n",
      "the incident was sure enough, understood nothing; but the understandings\r\n",
      "that surrounded her, filling all the air, made it a heavier compound to\r\n",
      "breathe than any Mr. Longdon had yet tasted. This heaviness had grown\r\n",
      "for him through the long sweet summer day, and there was something in\r\n",
      "his at last finding himself ensconced with the Duchess that made it\r\n",
      "supremely oppressive. The contact was one that, none the less, he would\r\n",
      "not have availed himself of a decent pretext to avoid. With so many\r\n",
      "fine mysteries playing about him there was relief, at the point he had\r\n",
      "reached, rather than alarm, in the thought of knowing the worst; which\r\n",
      "it pressed upon him somehow that the Duchess must not only altogether\r\n",
      "know but must in any relation quite naturally communicate. It fluttered\r\n",
      "him rather that a person who had an understanding with Lord Petherton\r\n",
      "should so single him out as to wish for one also with himself; such a\r\n",
      "person must either have great variety of mind or have a wonderful idea\r\n",
      "of HIS variety. It was true indeed that Mr. Mitchett must have the most\r\n",
      "extraordinary understanding, and yet with Mr. Mitchett he now found\r\n",
      "himself quite pleasantly at his ease. Their host, however, was a person\r\n",
      "sui generis, whom he had accepted, once for all, the inconsequence of\r\n",
      "liking in conformity with the need he occasionally felt to put it on\r\n",
      "record that he was not narrow-minded. Perhaps at bottom he most liked\r\n",
      "Mitchy because Mitchy most liked Nanda; there hung about him still\r\n",
      "moreover the faded fragrance of the superstition that hospitality not\r\n",
      "declined is one of the things that \"oblige.\" It obliged the thoughts,\r\n",
      "for Mr. Longdon, as well as the manners, and in the especial form in\r\n",
      "which he was now committed to it would have made him, had he really\r\n",
      "thought any ill, ask himself what the deuce then he was doing in\r\n",
      "the man's house. All of which didn't prevent some of Mitchy's queer\r\n",
      "condonations--if condonations in fact they were--from not wholly, by\r\n",
      "themselves, soothing his vague unrest, an unrest which never had been so\r\n",
      "great as at the moment he heard the Duchess abruptly say to him: \"Do\r\n",
      "you know my idea about Nanda? It's my particular desire you should--the\r\n",
      "reason, really, why I've thus laid violent hands on you. Nanda, my dear\r\n",
      "man, should marry at the very first moment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was more interesting than he had expected, and the effect produced\r\n",
      "by his interlocutress, as well as doubtless not lost on her, was\r\n",
      "shown in his suppressed start. \"There has been no reason why I should\r\n",
      "attribute to you any judgement of the matter; but I've had one myself,\r\n",
      "and I don't see why I shouldn't say frankly that it's very much the one\r\n",
      "you express. It would be a very good thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A very good thing, but none of my business?\"--the Duchess's vivacity\r\n",
      "was not unamiable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was on this circumstance that her companion for an instant perhaps\r\n",
      "meditated. \"It's probably not in my interest to say that. I should give\r\n",
      "you too easy a retort. It would strike any one as quite as much your\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it ought to be somebody's, you know. One would suppose it to be\r\n",
      "her mother's--her father's; but in this country the parents are even\r\n",
      "more emancipated than the children. Suppose, really, since it appears to\r\n",
      "be nobody's affair, that you and I do make it ours. We needn't either\r\n",
      "of us,\" she continued, \"be concerned for the other's reasons, though I'm\r\n",
      "perfectly ready, I assure you, to put my cards on the table. You've your\r\n",
      "feelings--we know they're beautiful. I, on my side, have mine--for which\r\n",
      "I don't pretend anything but that they're strong. They can dispense\r\n",
      "with being beautiful when they're so perfectly settled. Besides, I\r\n",
      "may mention, they're rather nice than otherwise. Edward and I have a\r\n",
      "cousinage, though for all he does to keep it up--! If he leaves his\r\n",
      "children to play in the street I take it seriously enough to make an\r\n",
      "occasional dash for them before they're run over. And I want for Nanda\r\n",
      "simply the man she herself wants--it isn't as if I wanted for her a\r\n",
      "dwarf or a hunchback or a coureur or a drunkard. Vanderbank's a man whom\r\n",
      "any woman, don't you think? might be--whom more than one woman IS--glad\r\n",
      "of for herself: beau comme le jour, awfully conceited and awfully\r\n",
      "patronising, but clever and successful and yet liked, and without, so\r\n",
      "far as I know, any of the terrific appendages which in this country so\r\n",
      "often diminish the value of even the pleasantest people. He hasn't five\r\n",
      "horrible unmarried sisters for his wife to have always on a visit. The\r\n",
      "way your women don't marry is the ruin here of society, and I've been\r\n",
      "assured in good quarters--though I don't know so much about that--the\r\n",
      "ruin also of conversation and of literature. Isn't it precisely just a\r\n",
      "little to keep Nanda herself from becoming that kind of appendage--say\r\n",
      "to poor Harold, say, one of these days, to her younger brother and\r\n",
      "sister--that friends like you and me feel the importance of bestirring\r\n",
      "ourselves in time? Of course she's supposedly young, but she's really\r\n",
      "any age you like: your London world so fearfully batters and bruises\r\n",
      "them.\" She had gone fast and far, but it had given Mr. Longdon time to\r\n",
      "feel himself well afloat. There were so many things in it all to take up\r\n",
      "that he laid his hand--of which, he was not unconscious, the feebleness\r\n",
      "exposed him--on the nearest. \"Why I'm sure her mother--after twenty\r\n",
      "years of it--is fresh enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fresh? You find Mrs. Brook fresh?\" The Duchess had a manner that, in\r\n",
      "its all-knowingness, rather humiliated than encouraged; but he was all\r\n",
      "the more resolute for being conscious of his own reserves. \"It seems to\r\n",
      "me it's fresh to look about thirty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That indeed would be perfect. But she doesn't--she looks about three.\r\n",
      "She simply looks a baby.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Duchess, you're really too particular!\" he retorted, feeling that,\r\n",
      "as the trodden worm will turn, anxiety itself may sometimes tend to wit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She met him in her own way. \"I know what I mean. My niece is a person\r\n",
      "_I_ call fresh. It's warranted, as they say in the shops. Besides,\" she\r\n",
      "went on, \"if a married woman has been knocked about that's only a part\r\n",
      "of her condition. Elle l'a lien voulu, and if you're married you're\r\n",
      "married; it's the smoke--or call it the soot!--of the fire. You know,\r\n",
      "yourself,\" she roundly pursued, \"that Nanda's situation appals you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh 'appals'!\" he restrictively murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It even tried a little his companion's patience. \"There you are, you\r\n",
      "English--you'll never face your own music. It's amazing what you'd\r\n",
      "rather do with a thing--anything not to shoot at or to make money\r\n",
      "with--than look at its meaning. If I wished to save the girl as YOU wish\r\n",
      "it I should know exactly from what. But why differ about reasons,\" she\r\n",
      "asked, \"when we're at one about the fact? I don't mention the greatest\r\n",
      "of Vanderbank's merits,\" she added--\"his having so delicious a friend.\r\n",
      "By whom, let me hasten to assure you,\" she laughed, \"I don't in the\r\n",
      "least mean Mrs. Brook! She IS delicious if you like, but believe me when\r\n",
      "I tell you, caro mio--if you need to be told--that for effective action\r\n",
      "on him you're worth twenty of her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was most visible in Mr. Longdon was that, however it came to him,\r\n",
      "he had rarely before, all at once, had so much given him to think\r\n",
      "about. Again the only way to manage was to take what came uppermost.\r\n",
      "\"By effective action you mean action on the matter of his proposing for\r\n",
      "Nanda?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess's assent was noble. \"You can make him propose--you can make,\r\n",
      "I mean, a sure thing of it. You can doter the bride.\" Then as with\r\n",
      "the impulse to meet benevolently and more than halfway her companion's\r\n",
      "imperfect apprehension: \"You can settle on her something that will make\r\n",
      "her a parti.\" His apprehension was perhaps imperfect, but it could\r\n",
      "still lead somehow to his flushing all over, and this demonstration the\r\n",
      "Duchess as quickly took into account. \"Poor Edward, you know, won't give\r\n",
      "her a penny.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Decidedly she went fast, but Mr. Longdon in a moment had caught up.\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Vanderbank--your idea is--would require on the part of his wife\r\n",
      "something of that sort?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pray who wouldn't--in the world we all move in--require it quite as\r\n",
      "much? Mr. Vanderbank, I'm assured, has no means of his own at all, and\r\n",
      "if he doesn't believe in impecunious marriages it's not I who shall be\r\n",
      "shocked at him. For myself I simply despise them. He has nothing but a\r\n",
      "poor official salary. If it's enough for one it would be little for two,\r\n",
      "and would be still less for half a dozen. They're just the people to\r\n",
      "have, that blessed pair, a fine old English family.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon was now fairly abreast of it. \"What it comes to then, the\r\n",
      "idea you're so good as to put before me, is to bribe him to take her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess remained bland, but she fixed him. \"You say that as if you\r\n",
      "were scandalised, but if you try Mr. Van with it I don't think he'll\r\n",
      "be. And you won't persuade me,\" she went on finely, \"that you haven't\r\n",
      "yourself thought of it.\" She kept her eyes on him, and the effect of\r\n",
      "them, soon enough visible in his face, was such as presently to make her\r\n",
      "exult at her felicity. \"You're of a limpidity, dear man--you've only\r\n",
      "to be said 'bo!' to and you confess. Consciously or unconsciously--the\r\n",
      "former, really, I'm inclined to think--you've wanted him for her.\" She\r\n",
      "paused an instant to enjoy her triumph, after which she continued: \"And\r\n",
      "you've wanted her for him. I make you out, you'll say--for I see you\r\n",
      "coming--one of those horrible benevolent busy-bodies who are the worst\r\n",
      "of the class, but you've only to think a little--if I may go so far--to\r\n",
      "see that no 'making' at all is required. You've only one link with the\r\n",
      "Brooks, but that link is golden. How can we, all of us, by this time,\r\n",
      "not have grasped and admired the beauty of your feeling for Lady Julia?\r\n",
      "There it is--I make you wince: to speak of it is to profane it. Let us\r\n",
      "by all means not speak of it then, but let us act on it.\" He had at last\r\n",
      "turned his face from her, and it now took in, from the vantage of his\r\n",
      "high position, only the loveliness of the place and the hour, which\r\n",
      "included a glimpse of Lord Petherton and little Aggie, who, down in\r\n",
      "the garden, slowly strolled in familiar union. Each had a hand in the\r\n",
      "other's, swinging easily as they went; their talk was evidently of\r\n",
      "flowers and fruits and birds; it was quite like father and daughter.\r\n",
      "One could see half a mile off in short that THEY weren't flirting. Our\r\n",
      "friend's bewilderment came in odd cold gusts: these were unreasoned and\r\n",
      "capricious; one of them, at all events, during his companion's pause,\r\n",
      "must have roared in his ears. Was it not therefore through some\r\n",
      "continuance of the sound that he heard her go on speaking? \"Of course\r\n",
      "you know the poor child's own condition.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It took him a good while to answer. \"Do YOU know it?\" he asked with his\r\n",
      "eyes still away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If your question's ironical,\" she laughed, \"your irony's perfectly\r\n",
      "wasted. I should be ashamed of myself if, with my relationship and my\r\n",
      "interest, I hadn't made sure. Nanda's fairly sick--as sick as a little\r\n",
      "cat--with her passion.\" It was with an intensity of silence that he\r\n",
      "appeared to accept this; he was even so dumb for a minute that the\r\n",
      "oddity of the image could draw from him no natural sound. The Duchess\r\n",
      "once more, accordingly, recognised an occasion. \"It has doubtless\r\n",
      "already occurred to you that, since your sentiment for the living is\r\n",
      "the charming fruit of your sentiment for the dead, there would be a\r\n",
      "sacrifice to Lady Julia's memory more exquisite than any other.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this finally Mr. Longdon turned. \"The effort--on the lines you speak\r\n",
      "of--for Nanda's happiness?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She fairly glowed with hope. \"And by the same token such a piece of\r\n",
      "poetic justice! Quite the loveliest it would be, I think, one had ever\r\n",
      "heard of.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, for some time more, they sat confronted. \"I don't quite see your\r\n",
      "difficulty,\" he said at last. \"I do happen to know, I confess, that\r\n",
      "Nanda herself extremely desires the execution of your project.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend's smile betrayed no surprise at this effect of her eloquence.\r\n",
      "\"You're bad at dodging. Nanda's desire is inevitably to stop off for\r\n",
      "herself every question of any one but Vanderbank. If she wants me to\r\n",
      "succeed in arranging with Mr. Mitchett can you ask for a plainer sign\r\n",
      "of her private predicament? But you've signs enough, I see\"--she caught\r\n",
      "herself up: \"we may take them all for granted. I've known perfectly from\r\n",
      "the first that the only difficulty would come from her mother--but also\r\n",
      "that that would be stiff.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The movement with which Mr. Longdon removed his glasses might have\r\n",
      "denoted a certain fear to participate in too much of what the Duchess\r\n",
      "had known. \"I've not been ignorant that Mrs. Brookenham favours Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he was not to be let off with that. \"Then you've not been blind, I\r\n",
      "suppose, to her reason for doing so.\" He might not have been blind, but\r\n",
      "his vision, at this, scarce showed sharpness, and it determined in his\r\n",
      "interlocutress the shortest of short cuts. \"She favours Mr. Mitchett\r\n",
      "because she wants 'old Van' herself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was evidently conscious of looking at her hard. \"In what\r\n",
      "sense--herself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you must supply the sense; I can give you only the fact--and it's\r\n",
      "the fact that concerns us. Voyons\" she almost impatiently broke out;\r\n",
      "\"don't try to create unnecessary obscurities by being unnecessarily\r\n",
      "modest. Besides, I'm not touching your modesty. Supply any sense\r\n",
      "whatever that may miraculously satisfy your fond English imagination:\r\n",
      "I don't insist in the least on a bad one. She does want him\r\n",
      "herself--that's all I say. 'Pourquoi faires' you ask--or rather, being\r\n",
      "too shy, don't ask, but would like to if you dared or didn't fear I'd\r\n",
      "be shocked. I CAN'T be shocked, but frankly I can't tell you either. The\r\n",
      "situation belongs, I think, to an order I don't understand. I understand\r\n",
      "either one thing or the other--I understand taking a man up or letting\r\n",
      "him alone. But I don't really get at Mrs. Brook. You must judge at any\r\n",
      "rate for yourself. Vanderbank could of course tell you if he would--but\r\n",
      "it wouldn't be right that he should. So the one thing we have to do\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She had moved, looking off and about her--little Aggie always on her\r\n",

      "Late that night, in the smoking room, when the smokers--talkers and\r\n",
      "listeners alike--were about to disperse, Mr. Longdon asked Vanderbank to\r\n",
      "stay, and then it was that the young man, to whom all the evening he had\r\n",
      "not addressed a word, could make out why, a little unnaturally, he had\r\n",
      "prolonged his vigil. \"I've something particular to say to you and I've\r\n",
      "been waiting. I hope you don't mind. It's rather important.\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "expressed on the spot the liveliest desire to oblige him and, quickly\r\n",
      "lighting another cigarette, mounted again to the deep divan with which\r\n",
      "a part of the place was furnished. The smoking-room at Mertle was not\r\n",
      "unworthy of the general nobleness, and the fastidious spectator had\r\n",
      "clearly been reckoned on in the great leather-covered lounge that,\r\n",
      "raised by a step or two above the floor, applied its back to two\r\n",
      "quarters of the wall and enjoyed most immediately a view of the\r\n",
      "billiard-table. Mr. Longdon continued for a minute to roam with the air\r\n",
      "of dissimulated absence that, during the previous hour and among the\r\n",
      "other men, his companion's eye had not lost; he pushed a ball or two\r\n",
      "about, examined the form of an ash-stand, swung his glasses almost\r\n",
      "with violence and declined either to smoke or to sit down. Vanderbank,\r\n",
      "perched aloft on the bench and awaiting developments, had a little the\r\n",
      "look of some prepossessing criminal who, in court, should have changed\r\n",
      "places with the judge. He was unlike many a man of marked good looks\r\n",
      "in that the effect of evening dress was not, with a perversity often\r\n",
      "observed in such cases, to over-emphasise his fineness. His type was\r\n",
      "rather chastened than heightened, and he sat there moreover with a\r\n",
      "primary discretion quite in the note of the deference that from the\r\n",
      "first, with his friend of the elder fashion, he had taken as imposed.\r\n",
      "He had a strong sense for shades of respect and was now careful to\r\n",
      "loll scarcely more than with an official superior. \"If you ask me,\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon presently continued, \"why at this hour of the night--after a day\r\n",
      "at best too heterogeneous--I don't keep over till to-morrow whatever I\r\n",
      "may have to say, I can only tell you that I appeal to you now because\r\n",
      "I've something on my mind that I shall sleep the better for being rid\r\n",
      "of.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was space to circulate in front of the haut-pas, where he had\r\n",
      "still paced and still swung his glasses; but with these words he had\r\n",
      "paused, leaning against the billiard-table, to meet the interested\r\n",
      "urbanity of the answer they produced. \"Are you very sure that having\r\n",
      "got rid of it you WILL sleep? Is it a pure confidence,\" Vanderbank said,\r\n",
      "\"that you do me the honour to make me? Is it something terrific that\r\n",
      "requires a reply, so that I shall have to take account on my side of the\r\n",
      "rest I may deprive you of?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't take account of anything--I'm myself a man who always takes too\r\n",
      "much. It isn't a matter about which I press you for an immediate answer.\r\n",
      "You can give me no answer probably without a good deal of thought. I'VE\r\n",
      "thought a good deal--otherwise I wouldn't speak. I only want to put\r\n",
      "something before you and leave it there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I never see you,\" said Vanderbank, \"that you don't put something before\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That sounds,\" his friend returned, \"as if I rather overloaded--what's\r\n",
      "the sort of thing you fellows nowadays say?--your intellectual board.\r\n",
      "If there's a congestion of dishes sweep everything without scruple away.\r\n",
      "I've never put before you anything like this.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He spoke with a weight that in the great space, where it resounded a\r\n",
      "little, made an impression--an impression marked by the momentary pause\r\n",
      "that fell between them. He partly broke the silence first by beginning\r\n",
      "to walk again, and then Vanderbank broke it as through the apprehension\r\n",
      "of their becoming perhaps too solemn. \"Well, you immensely interest\r\n",
      "me and you really couldn't have chosen a better time. A secret--for we\r\n",
      "shall make it that of course, shan't we?--at this witching hour, in this\r\n",
      "great old house, is all my visit here will have required to make the\r\n",
      "whole thing a rare remembrance. So I assure you the more you put before\r\n",
      "me the better.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon took up another ash-tray, but with the air of doing so as\r\n",
      "a direct consequence of Vanderbank's tone. After he had laid it down he\r\n",
      "put on his glasses; then fixing his companion he brought out: \"Have you\r\n",
      "no idea at all--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of what you have in your head? Dear Mr. Longdon, how SHOULD I have?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'm wondering if I shouldn't perhaps have a little in your place.\r\n",
      "There's nothing that in the circumstances occurs to you as likely I\r\n",
      "should want to say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank gave a laugh that might have struck an auditor as a\r\n",
      "trifle uneasy. \"When you speak of 'the circumstances' you do a thing\r\n",
      "that--unless you mean the simple thrilling ones of this particular\r\n",
      "moment--always of course opens the door of the lurid for a man of\r\n",
      "any imagination. To such a man you've only to give a nudge for his\r\n",
      "conscience to jump. That's at any rate the case with mine. It's never\r\n",
      "quite on its feet--so it's now already on its back.\" He stopped a\r\n",
      "little--his smile was even strained. \"Is what you want to put before me\r\n",
      "something awful I've done?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Excuse me if I press this point.\" Mr. Longdon spoke kindly, but if\r\n",
      "his friend's anxiety grew his own thereby diminished. \"Can you think of\r\n",
      "nothing at all?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean that I've done?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, but that--whether you've done it or not--I may have become aware\r\n",
      "of.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There could have been no better proof than Vanderbank's expression, on\r\n",
      "this, of his having mastered the secret of humouring without appearing\r\n",
      "to patronise. \"I think you ought to give me a little more of a clue.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon took off his glasses. \"Well--the clue's Nanda Brookenham.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I see.\" His friend had responded quickly, but for a minute said\r\n",
      "nothing more, and the great marble clock that gave the place the air\r\n",
      "of a club ticked louder in the stillness. Mr. Longdon waited with a\r\n",
      "benevolent want of mercy, yet with a look in his face that spoke of what\r\n",
      "depended for him--though indeed very far within--on the upshot of his\r\n",
      "patience. The hush between them, for that matter, became a conscious\r\n",
      "public measure of the young man's honesty. He evidently at last felt\r\n",
      "it as such, and there would have been for an observer of his handsome\r\n",
      "controlled face a study of some sharp things. \"I judge that you ask me\r\n",
      "for such an utterance,\" he finally said, \"as very few persons at any\r\n",
      "time have the right to expect of a man. Think of the people--and very\r\n",
      "decent ones--to whom on so many a question one must only reply that it's\r\n",
      "none of their business.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see you know what I mean,\" said Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you know also the distinguished exception I make of you. There\r\n",
      "isn't another man with whom I'd talk of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And even to me you don't! But I'm none the less obliged to you,\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It isn't only the gravity,\" his companion went on; \"it's the ridicule\r\n",
      "that inevitably attaches--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The manner in which Mr. Longdon indicated the empty room was in itself\r\n",
      "an interruption. \"Don't I sufficiently spare you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you, thank you,\" said Vanderbank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Besides, it's not for nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course not!\" the young man returned, though with a look of noting\r\n",
      "the next moment a certain awkwardness in his concurrence. \"But don't\r\n",
      "spare me now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't mean to.\" Mr. Longdon had his back to the table again, on which\r\n",
      "he rested with each hand on the rim. \"I don't mean to,\" he repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His victim gave a laugh that betrayed at least the drop of a tension.\r\n",
      "\"Yet I don't quite see what you can do to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's just what for some time past I've been trying to think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And at last you've discovered?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--it has finally glimmered out a little in this extraordinary\r\n",
      "place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank frankly wondered. \"In consequence of anything particular that\r\n",
      "has happened?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had a pause. \"For an old idiot who notices as much as\r\n",
      "I something particular's always happening. If you're a man of\r\n",
      "imagination--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" Vanderbank broke in, \"I know how much more in that case you're\r\n",
      "one! It only makes me regret,\" he continued, \"that I've not attended\r\n",
      "more since yesterday to what you've been about.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've been about nothing but what among you people I'm always about.\r\n",
      "I've been seeing, feeling, thinking. That makes no show, of course I'm\r\n",
      "aware, for any one but myself, and it's wholly my own affair. Except\r\n",
      "indeed,\" he added, \"so far as I've taken into my head to make, on it\r\n",
      "all, this special appeal. There are things that have come home to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I see, I see,\" Vanderbank showed the friendliest alertness. \"I'm to\r\n",
      "take it from you then, with all the avidity of my vanity, that I strike\r\n",
      "you as the person best able to understand what they are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon appeared to wonder an instant if his intelligence now had\r\n",
      "not almost too much of a glitter: he kept the same position, his back\r\n",
      "against the table, and while Vanderbank, on the settee, pressed upright\r\n",
      "against the wall, they recognised in silence that they were trying each\r\n",
      "other. \"You're much the best of them. I've my ideas about you. You've\r\n",
      "great gifts.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, we're worthy of each other. When Greek meets Greek--!\" and\r\n",
      "the young man laughed while, a little with the air of bracing himself,\r\n",
      "he folded his arms. \"Here we are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion looked at him a moment longer, then, turning away, went\r\n",
      "slowly round the table. On the further side of it he stopped again and,\r\n",
      "after a minute, with a nervous movement, set a ball or two in motion.\r\n",
      "\"It's beautiful--but it's terrible!\" he finally murmured. He hadn't his\r\n",
      "eyes on Vanderbank, who for a minute said nothing, and he presently went\r\n",
      "on: \"To see it and not to want to try to help--well, I can't do that.\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, still neither speaking nor moving, remained as if he might\r\n",
      "interrupt something of high importance, and his friend, passing along\r\n",
      "the opposite edge of the table, continued to produce in the stillness,\r\n",
      "without the cue, the small click of the ivory. \"How long--if you don't\r\n",
      "mind my asking--have you known it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even for this at first Vanderbank had no answer--none but to rise from\r\n",
      "his place, come down to the floor and, standing there, look at Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon across the table. He was serious now, but without being solemn.\r\n",
      "\"How can one tell? One can never be sure. A man may fancy, may wonder;\r\n",
      "but about a girl, a person so much younger than himself and so much more\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"A delicacy?\" Mr. Longdon suggested. \"It may be that; the name doesn't\r\n",

      "one side and yet not some other kind of brute on the other.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon listened with consideration--with a beautiful little air\r\n",
      "indeed of being, in his all but finally benighted state, earnestly open\r\n",
      "to information on such points from a magnificent young man. \"He doesn't\r\n",
      "want, you mean, to be a coxcomb?--and he doesn't want to be cruel?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, visibly preoccupied, produced a faint kind smile. \"Oh you\r\n",
      "KNOW!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the table on this, and the eyes of his companion, who after an instant\r\n",
      "had caught his meaning, watched him move along the room and approach\r\n",
      "another part of the divan. The consequence of the passage was that\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's only rejoinder was presently to say: \"I can't tell you\r\n",
      "how long I've imagined--have asked myself. She's so charming, so\r\n",
      "interesting, and I feel as if I had known her always. I've thought of\r\n",
      "one thing and another to do--and then, on purpose, haven't thought at\r\n",
      "all. That has mostly seemed to me best.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I gather,\" said Mr. Longdon, \"that your interest in her--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hasn't the same character as her interest in ME?\" Vanderbank had taken\r\n",
      "him up responsively, but after speaking looked about for a match and\r\n",
      "lighted a new cigarette. \"I'm sure you understand,\" he broke out, \"what\r\n",
      "an extreme effort it is to me to talk of such things!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes. But it's just effort only? It gives you no pleasure? I mean\r\n",
      "the fact of her condition,\" Mr. Longdon explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank had really to think a little. \"However much it might give me\r\n",
      "I should probably not be a fellow to gush. I'm a self-conscious stick of\r\n",
      "a Briton.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But even a stick of a Briton--!\" Mr. Longdon faltered and hovered.\r\n",
      "\"I've gushed in short to YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About Lady Julia?\" the young man frankly asked. \"Is gushing what you\r\n",
      "call what you've done?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Say then we're sticks of Britons. You're not in any degree at all in\r\n",
      "love?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There fell between them, before Vanderbank replied, another pause, of\r\n",
      "which he took advantage to move once more round the table. Mr. Longdon\r\n",
      "meanwhile had mounted to the high bench and sat there as if the judge\r\n",
      "were now in his proper place. At last his companion spoke. \"What you're\r\n",
      "coming to is of course that you've conceived a desire.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it--strange as it may seem. But believe me, it has not been\r\n",
      "precipitate. I've watched you both.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I knew you were watching HER,\" said Vanderbank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To such a tune that I've made up my mind. I want her so to marry--!\"\r\n",
      "But on the odd little quaver of longing with which he brought it out the\r\n",
      "elder man fairly hung.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\" said Vanderbank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, so that on the day she does she'll come into the interest of a\r\n",
      "considerable sum of money--already very decently invested--that I've\r\n",
      "determined to settle on her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's instant admiration flushed across the room. \"How awfully\r\n",
      "jolly of you--how beautiful!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh there's a way to show practically your appreciation of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Vanderbank, for enthusiasm, scarcely heard him. \"I can't tell you\r\n",
      "how admirable I think you.\" Then eagerly, \"Does Nanda know it?\" he\r\n",
      "demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, after a wait, spoke with comparative dryness. \"My idea has\r\n",
      "been that for the present you alone shall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank took it in. \"No other man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion looked still graver. \"I need scarcely say that I depend on\r\n",
      "you to keep the fact to yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Absolutely then and utterly. But that won't prevent what I think of it.\r\n",
      "Nothing for a long time has given me such joy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shining and sincere, he had held for a minute Mr. Longdon's eyes. \"Then\r\n",
      "you do care for her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Immensely. Never, I think, so much as now. That sounds of a grossness,\r\n",
      "doesn't it?\" the young man laughed. \"But your announcement really lights\r\n",
      "up the mind.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend for a moment almost glowed with his pleasure. \"The sum I've\r\n",
      "fixed upon would be, I may mention, substantial, and I should of course\r\n",
      "be prepared with a clear statement--a very definite pledge--of my\r\n",
      "intentions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So much the better! Only\"--Vanderbank suddenly pulled himself up--\"to\r\n",
      "get it she MUST marry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's not in my interest to allow you to suppose she needn't, and it's\r\n",
      "only because of my intensely wanting her marriage that I've spoken to\r\n",
      "you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And on the ground also with it\"--Vanderbank so far concurred--\"of your\r\n",
      "quite taking for granted my only having to put myself forward?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If his friend seemed to cast about it proved but to be for the fullest\r\n",
      "expression. Nothing in fact could have been more charged than the quiet\r\n",
      "way in which he presently said: \"My dear boy, I back you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank clearly was touched by it. \"How extraordinarily kind you are\r\n",
      "to me!\" Mr. Longdon's silence appeared to reply that he was willing to\r\n",
      "let it go for that, and the young man next went on: \"What it comes to\r\n",
      "then--as you put it--is that it's a way for me to add something handsome\r\n",
      "to my income.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon sat for a little with his eyes attached to the green field\r\n",
      "of the billiard-table, vivid in the spreading suspended lamplight. \"I\r\n",

      "Another person present might have felt rather taxed either to determine\r\n",
      "the degree of provocation represented by Vanderbank's considerate smile,\r\n",
      "or to say if there was an appreciable interval before he rang out:\r\n",
      "\"I think, you know, you oughtn't to do anything of the sort. Let that\r\n",
      "alone, please. The great thing is the interest--the great thing is the\r\n",
      "wish you express. It represents a view of me, an attitude toward me--!\"\r\n",
      "He pulled up, dropping his arms and turning away before the complete\r\n",
      "image.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's nothing in those things that need overwhelm you. It would be\r\n",
      "odd if you hadn't yourself, about your value and your future a feeling\r\n",
      "quite as lively as any feeling of mine. There IS mine at all events. I\r\n",
      "can't help it. Accept it. Then of the other feeling--how SHE moves me--I\r\n",
      "won't speak.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You sufficiently show it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon continued to watch the bright circle on the table, lost in\r\n",
      "which a moment he let his friend's answer pass. \"I won't begin to you on\r\n",
      "Nanda.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't,\" said Vanderbank. But in the pause that ensued each, in one way\r\n",
      "or another, might have been thinking of her for himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was broken by Mr. Longdon's presently going on: \"Of course what it\r\n",
      "superficially has the air of is my offering to pay you for taking a\r\n",
      "certain step. It's open to you to be grand and proud--to wrap yourself\r\n",
      "in your majesty and ask if I suppose you bribeable. I haven't spoken\r\n",
      "without having thought of that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Vanderbank all responsively, \"but it isn't as if you\r\n",
      "proposed to me, is it, anything dreadful? If one cares for a girl one's\r\n",
      "deucedly glad she has money. The more of anything good she has the\r\n",
      "better. I may assure you,\" he added with the brightness of his friendly\r\n",
      "intelligence and quite as if to show his companion the way to be least\r\n",
      "concerned--\"I may assure you that once I were disposed to act on your\r\n",
      "suggestion I'd make short work of any vulgar interpretation of my\r\n",
      "motive. I should simply try to be as fine as yourself.\" He smoked, he\r\n",
      "moved about, then came up in another place. \"I dare say you know that\r\n",
      "dear old Mitchy, under whose blessed roof we're plotting this midnight\r\n",
      "treason, would marry her like a shot and without a penny.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think I know everything--I think I've thought of everything. Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchett,\" Mr. Longdon added, \"is impossible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank appeared for an instant to wonder. \"Wholly then through HER\r\n",
      "attitude?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Altogether.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again he hesitated. \"You've asked her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've asked her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more Vanderbank faltered. \"And that's how you know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About YOUR chance? That's how I know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man, consuming his cigarette with concentration, took again\r\n",
      "several turns. \"And your idea IS to give one time?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had for a minute to turn his idea over. \"How much time do\r\n",
      "you want?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank gave a headshake that was both restrictive and indulgent. \"I\r\n",
      "must live into it a little. Your offer has been before me only these few\r\n",
      "minutes, and it's too soon for me to commit myself to anything whatever.\r\n",
      "Except,\" he added gallantly, \"to my gratitude.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, at this, on the divan, got up, as Vanderbank had previously\r\n",
      "done, under the spring of emotion; only, unlike Vanderbank, he still\r\n",
      "stood there, his hands in his pockets and his face, a little paler,\r\n",

      "\"You've no strong enough impulse--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend met him with admirable candour. \"Wouldn't it seem that if I\r\n",
      "had I would by this time have taken the jump?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Without waiting, you mean, for anybody's money?\" Mr. Longdon\r\n",
      "cultivated for a little a doubt. \"Of course she has struck one as--till\r\n",
      "now--tremendously young.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank looked about once more for matches and occupied a time with\r\n",
      "relighting. \"Till now--yes. But it's not,\" he pursued, \"only because\r\n",
      "she's so young that--for each of us, and for dear old Mitchy too--she's\r\n",
      "so interesting.\" Mr. Longdon had restlessly stepped down, and\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's eyes followed him till he stopped again. \"I make out that\r\n",
      "in spite of what you said to begin with you're conscious of a certain\r\n",
      "pressure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the matter of time? Oh yes, I do want it DONE. That,\" Nanda's patron\r\n",
      "simply explained, \"is why I myself put on the screw.\" He spoke with the\r\n",
      "ring of impatience. \"I want her got out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Out'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Out of her mother's house.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank laughed though--more immediately--he had coloured. \"Why, her\r\n",
      "mother's house is just where I see her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Precisely; and if it only weren't we might get on faster.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, for all his kindness, looked still more amused. \"But if it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, through adjusted glasses, took him in with a look that\r\n",
      "was sad as well as sharp, then jerked the glasses off. \"Oh you do\r\n",
      "understand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Vanderbank, \"I'm a mass of corruption!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You may perfectly be, but you shall not,\" Mr. Longdon returned with\r\n",
      "decision, \"get off on any such plea. If you're good enough for me you're\r\n",
      "good enough, as you thoroughly know, on whatever head, for any one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you.\" But Vanderbank, for all his happy appreciation, thought\r\n",
      "again. \"We ought at any rate to remember, oughtn't we? that we should\r\n",
      "have Mrs. Brook against us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion faltered but an instant. \"Ah that's another thing I know.\r\n",

      "\"I see, I see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The response had been prompt, yet Mr. Longdon seemed suddenly to show\r\n",
      "that he suspected the superficial. \"Unless it's with Mrs. Brook you're\r\n",
      "in love.\" Then on his friend's taking the idea with a mere headshake of\r\n",
      "negation, a repudiation that might even have astonished by its own lack\r\n",
      "of surprise, \"Or unless Mrs. Brook's in love with you,\" he amended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank had for this any decent gaiety. \"Ah that of course may\r\n",
      "perfectly be!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But IS it? That's the question.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He continued light. \"If she had declared her passion shouldn't I rather\r\n",
      "compromise her--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By letting me know?\" Mr. Longdon reflected. \"I'm sure I can't say--it's\r\n",
      "a sort of thing for which I haven't a measure or a precedent. In my time\r\n",
      "women didn't declare their passion. I'm thinking of what the meaning is\r\n",
      "of Mrs. Brookenham's wanting you--as I've heard it called--herself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, still with his smile, smoked a minute. \"That's what you've\r\n",
      "heard it called?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but you must excuse me from telling you by whom.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was amused at his friend's discretion. \"It's unimaginable. But it\r\n",
      "doesn't matter. We all call everything--anything. The meaning of it, if\r\n",
      "you and I put it so, is--well, a modern shade.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must deal then yourself,\" said Mr. Longdon, \"with your modern\r\n",
      "shades.\" He spoke now as if the case simply awaited such dealing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at this his young friend was more grave. \"YOU could do nothing?--to\r\n",
      "bring, I mean, Mrs. Brook round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon fairly started. \"Propose on your behalf for her daughter?\r\n",
      "With your authority--tomorrow. Authorise me and I instantly act.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "taking leave of Mrs. Brook and found Mrs. Brook herself in the state of\r\n",
      "muffled exaltation that was the mark of all her intercourse--and most\r\n",
      "of all perhaps of her farewells--with Lady Fanny. This splendid creature\r\n",
      "gave out, as it were, so little that Vanderbank was freshly struck\r\n",
      "with all Mrs. Brook could take in, though nothing, for that matter, in\r\n",
      "Buckingham Crescent, had been more fully formulated on behalf of the\r\n",
      "famous beauty than the imperturbable grandeur of her almost total\r\n",
      "absence of articulation. Every aspect of the phenomenon had been freely\r\n",
      "discussed there and endless ingenuity lavished on the question of how\r\n",
      "exactly it was that so much of what the world would in another case have\r\n",
      "called complete stupidity could be kept by a mere wonderful face from\r\n",
      "boring one to death. It was Mrs. Brook who, in this relation as in many\r\n",
      "others, had arrived at the supreme expression of the law, had thrown\r\n",
      "off, happily enough, to whomever it might have concerned: \"My dear\r\n",
      "thing, it all comes back, as everything always does, simply to personal\r\n",
      "pluck. It's only a question, no matter when or where, of having enough.\r\n",
      "Lady Fanny has the courage of all her silence--so much therefore that\r\n",
      "it sees her completely through and is what really makes her interesting.\r\n",
      "Not to be afraid of what may happen to you when you've no more to say\r\n",
      "for yourself than a steamer without a light--that truly is the highest\r\n",
      "heroism, and Lady Fanny's greatness is that she's never afraid. She\r\n",
      "takes the risk every time she goes out--takes, as you may say, her life\r\n",
      "in her hand. She just turns that glorious mask upon you and practically\r\n",
      "says: 'No, I won't open my lips--to call it really open--for the forty\r\n",
      "minutes I shall stay; but I calmly defy you, all the same, to kill me\r\n",
      "for it.' And we don't kill her--we delight in her; though when either of\r\n",
      "us watches her in a circle of others it's like seeing a very large blind\r\n",
      "person in the middle of Oxford Street. One fairly looks about for the\r\n",
      "police.\" Vanderbank, before his fellow visitor withdrew it, had the\r\n",
      "benefit of the glorious mask and could scarce have failed to be amused\r\n",
      "at the manner in which Mrs. Brook alone showed the stress of thought.\r\n",
      "Lady Fanny, in the other scale, sat aloft and Olympian, so that though\r\n",
      "visibly much had happened between the two ladies it had all happened\r\n",
      "only to the hostess. The sense in the air in short was just of Lady\r\n",
      "Fanny herself, who came to an end like a banquet or a procession.\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook left the room with her and, on coming back, was full of it.\r\n",
      "\"She'll go, she'll go!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go where?\" Vanderbank appeared to have for the question less attention\r\n",
      "than usual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, to the place her companion will propose. Probably--like Anna\r\n",
      "Karenine--to one of the smaller Italian towns.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Anna Karenine? She isn't a bit like Anna.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course she isn't so clever,\" said Mrs. Brook. \"But that would spoil\r\n",
      "her. So it's all right.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm glad it's all right,\" Vanderbank laughed. \"But I dare say we shall\r\n",
      "still have her with us a while.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall do that, I trust, whatever happens. She'll come up\r\n",
      "again--she'll remain, I feel, one of those enormous things that fate\r\n",
      "seems somehow to have given me as the occupation of my odd moments. I\r\n",
      "don't see,\" Mrs. Brook added, \"what still keeps her on the edge, which\r\n",
      "isn't an inch wide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank looked this time as if he only tried to wonder. \"Isn't it\r\n",
      "YOU?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook mused more deeply. \"Sometimes I think so. But I don't know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, how CAN you of course know, since she can't tell you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh if I depended on her telling--!\" Mrs. Brook shook out with this\r\n",
      "a sofa-cushion or two and sank into the corner she had arranged. The\r\n",
      "August afternoon was hot and the London air heavy; the room moreover,\r\n",
      "though agreeably bedimmed, gave out the staleness of the season's end.\r\n",
      "\"If you hadn't come to-day,\" she went on, \"you'd have missed me till I\r\n",
      "don't know when, for we've let the Hovel again--wretchedly, but still\r\n",
      "we've let it--and I go down on Friday to see that it isn't too filthy.\r\n",
      "Edward, who's furious at what I've taken for it, had his idea that we\r\n",
      "should go there this year ourselves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And now\"--Vanderbank took her up--\"that fond fancy has become simply\r\n",
      "the ghost of a dead thought, a ghost that, in company with a thousand\r\n",
      "predecessors, haunts the house in the twilight and pops at you out of\r\n",
      "odd corners.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Edward's dead thoughts are indeed a cheerful company and worthy of\r\n",
      "the perpetual mental mourning we seem to go about in. They're worse than\r\n",
      "the relations we're always losing without seeming to have any fewer,\r\n",
      "and I expect every day to hear that the Morning Post regrets to have\r\n",
      "to announce in that line too some new bereavement. The apparitions\r\n",
      "following the deaths of so many thoughts ARE particularly awful in the\r\n",
      "twilight, so that at this season, while the day drags and drags, I'm\r\n",
      "glad to have any one with me who may keep them at a distance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank had not sat down; slowly, familiarly he turned about. \"And\r\n",
      "where's Nanda?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh SHE doesn't help--she attracts rather the worst of the bogies.\r\n",
      "Edward and Nanda and Harold and I seated together are fairly a case for\r\n",
      "that--what do you call it?--investigating Society. Deprived of the sweet\r\n",
      "resource of the Hovel,\" Mrs. Brook continued, \"we shall each, from about\r\n",
      "the tenth on, forage somehow or other for ourselves. Mitchy perhaps,\"\r\n",
      "she added, \"will insist on taking us to Baireuth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That will be the form, you mean, of his own forage?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook just hesitated. \"Unless you should prefer to take it as the\r\n",
      "form of yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank appeared for a moment obligingly enough to turn this over,\r\n",
      "but with the effect of noting an objection. \"Oh I'm afraid I shall have\r\n",
      "to grind straight through the month and that by the time I'm free every\r\n",
      "Ring at Baireuth will certainly have been rung. Is it your idea to take\r\n",
      "Nanda?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She reached out for another cushion. \"If it's impossible for you to\r\n",
      "manage what I suggest why should that question interest you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear woman\"--and her visitor dropped into a chair--\"do you suppose\r\n",
      "my interest depends on such poverties as what I can 'manage'? You know\r\n",
      "well enough,\" he went on in another tone, \"why I care for Nanda and\r\n",
      "enquire about her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was perfectly ready. \"I know it, but only as a bad reason. Don't be\r\n",
      "too sure!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment they looked at each other. \"Don't be so sure, you mean,\r\n",
      "that the elation of it may go to my head? Are you really warning me\r\n",
      "against vanity?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your 'reallys,' my dear Van, are a little formidable, but it strikes\r\n",
      "me that before I tell you there's something I've a right to ask. Are you\r\n",
      "'really' what they call thinking of my daughter?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your asking,\" Vanderbank returned, \"exactly shows the state of your\r\n",
      "knowledge of the matter. I don't quite see moreover why you speak as if\r\n",
      "I were paying an abrupt and unnatural attention. What have I done the\r\n",
      "last three months but talk to you about her? What have you done but talk\r\n",
      "to ME about her? From the moment you first spoke to me--'monstrously,'\r\n",
      "I remember you called it--of the difference made in your social life by\r\n",
      "her finally established, her perpetual, her inexorable participation:\r\n",
      "from that moment what have we both done but put our heads together over\r\n",
      "the question of keeping the place tidy, as you called it--or as _I_\r\n",
      "called it, was it?--for the young female mind?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook faced serenely enough the directness of this challenge.\r\n",
      "\"Well, what are you coming to? I spoke of the change in my life of\r\n",
      "course; I happen to be so constituted that my life has something to do\r\n",
      "with my mind and my mind something to do with my talk. Good talk: you\r\n",
      "know--no one, dear Van, should know better--what part for me that plays.\r\n",
      "Therefore when one has deliberately to make one's talk bad--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Bad'?\" Vanderbank, in his amusement, fell back in his chair. \"Dear\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, you're too delightful!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You know what I mean--stupid, flat, fourth-rate. When one has to haul\r\n",
      "in sail to that degree--and for a perfectly outside reason--there's\r\n",
      "nothing strange in one's taking a friend sometimes into the confidence\r\n",
      "of one's irritation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" Vanderbank protested, \"you do yourself injustice. Irritation\r\n",
      "hasn't been for you the only consequence of the affair.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook gloomily thought. \"No, no--I've had my calmness: the calmness\r\n",
      "of deep despair. I've seemed to see everything go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh how can you say that,\" her visitor demanded, \"when just what we've\r\n",
      "most been agreed upon so often is the practical impossibility of\r\n",
      "making any change? Hasn't it seemed as if we really can't overcome\r\n",
      "conversational habits so thoroughly formed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again Mrs. Brook reflected. \"As if our way of looking at things were too\r\n",
      "serious to be trifled with? I don't know--I think it's only you who have\r\n",
      "denied our sacrifices, our compromises and concessions. I myself have\r\n",
      "constantly felt smothered in them. But there it is,\" she impatiently\r\n",
      "went on. \"What I don't admit is that you've given me ground to take for\r\n",
      "a proof of your 'intentions'--to use the odious term--your association\r\n",
      "with me on behalf of the preposterous fiction, as it after all is, of\r\n",
      "Nanda's blankness of mind.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's head, in his chair, was thrown back; his eyes ranged over\r\n",
      "the top of the room. \"There never has been any mystery about my thinking\r\n",
      "her--all in her own way--the nicest girl in London. She IS.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion was silent a little. \"She is, by all means. Well,\" she\r\n",
      "then added, \"so far as I may have been alive to the fact of any one's\r\n",
      "thinking her so, it's not out of place I should mention to you the\r\n",
      "difference made in my appreciation of it by our delightful little stay\r\n",
      "at Mertle. My views for Nanda,\" said Mrs. Brook, \"have somehow gone up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank was prompt to show how he could understand it. \"So that you\r\n",
      "wouldn't consider even Mitchy now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his friend took no notice of the question. \"The way Mr. Longdon\r\n",
      "distinguishes her is quite the sort of thing that gives a girl, as\r\n",
      "Harold says, a 'leg up.' It's awfully curious and has made me think:\r\n",
      "he isn't anything whatever, as London estimates go, in himself--so that\r\n",
      "what is it, pray, that makes him, when 'added on' to her, so double\r\n",
      "Nanda's value? I somehow or other see, through his being known to back\r\n",
      "her and through the pretty story of his loyalty to mamma and all the\r\n",
      "rest of it (oh if one chose to WORK that!) ever so much more of a chance\r\n",
      "for her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's eyes were on the ceiling. \"It IS curious, isn't it?--though\r\n",
      "I think he's rather more 'in himself,' even for the London estimate,\r\n",
      "than you quite understand.\" He appeared to give her time to take this\r\n",
      "up, but as she said nothing he pursued: \"I dare say that if even I now\r\n",
      "WERE to enter myself it would strike you as too late.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her attention to this was but indirect. \"It's awfully vulgar to be\r\n",
      "talking about it, but I can't help feeling that something possibly\r\n",
      "rather big will come of Mr. Longdon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah we've touched on that before,\" said Vanderbank, \"and you know you\r\n",
      "did think something might come even for me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She continued however, as if she scarce heard him, to work out her own\r\n",
      "vision. \"It's very true that up to now--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, up to now?\" he asked as she faltered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She faltered still a little. \"I do say the most hideous things. But\r\n",
      "we HAVE said worse, haven't we? Up to now, I mean, he hasn't given her\r\n",
      "anything. Unless indeed,\" she mused, \"she may have had something without\r\n",
      "telling me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank went much straighter. \"What sort of thing have you in mind?\r\n",
      "Are you thinking of money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. Isn't it awful?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That you should think of it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I should talk this way.\" Her friend was apparently not prepared\r\n",
      "with an assent, and she quickly enough pursued: \"If he HAD given her any\r\n",
      "it would come out somehow in her expenditure. She has tremendous liberty\r\n",
      "and is very secretive, but still it would come out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He wouldn't give her any without letting you know. Nor would she,\r\n",
      "without doing so,\" Vanderbank added, \"take it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" Mrs. Brook quietly said, \"she hates me enough for anything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's only your romantic theory.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more she appeared not to hear him; she gave the discussion another\r\n",
      "turn. \"Has he given YOU anything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her visitor smiled. \"Not so much as a cigarette. I've always my pockets\r\n",
      "full of them, and HE never: so he only takes mine. Oh Mrs. Brook,\" he\r\n",
      "continued, \"with me too--though I've also tremendous liberty!--it would\r\n",
      "come out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think you'd let me know,\" she returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I'd let you know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Silence, upon this, fell between them a little; which she was the\r\n",
      "first to break. \"She has gone with him this afternoon--by solemn\r\n",
      "appointment--to the South Kensington Museum.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was something in Mrs. Brook's dolorous drop that yet presented the\r\n",
      "news as a portent so great that he was moved again to mirth. \"Ah that's\r\n",
      "where she is? Then I confess she has scored. He has never taken ME to\r\n",
      "the South Kensington Museum.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You were asking what we're going to do,\" she went on. \"What I meant\r\n",
      "was--about Baireuth--that the question for Nanda's simplified. He has\r\n",
      "pressed her so to pay him a visit.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's assent was marked. \"I see: so that if you do go abroad\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"And by lots of other invitations.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These were such things as, for the most part, the young man could turn\r\n",
      "over. \"Do you mean you'd let her go alone--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To wherever she's asked?\" said Mrs. Brook. \"Why not? Don't talk like\r\n",
      "the Duchess.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "His friend looked really struck with it. \"That WOULD be working him. But\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but there you are, don't you see? Fancy 'getting' Mr. Longdon\r\n",

      "\"how the impossibility of exerting that sort of patronage for him\r\n",
      "immediately places him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook gave her companion one of those fitful glances of almost\r\n",
      "grateful appreciation with which their intercourse was even at its\r\n",
      "darkest hours frequently illumined. \"As if he were the Primate or the\r\n",
      "French Ambassador? Yes, you're right--one couldn't do it; though it's\r\n",
      "very odd and one doesn't quite see why. It does place him. But he\r\n",
      "becomes thereby exactly the very sort of person with whom it would\r\n",
      "be most of an advantage for her to go about. What a pity,\" Mrs. Brook\r\n",
      "sighed, \"he doesn't know more people!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah well, we ARE, in our way, bringing that to pass. Only we mustn't\r\n",
      "rush it. Leave it to Nanda herself,\" Vanderbank presently added; on\r\n",
      "which his companion so manifestly left it that she touched after a\r\n",
      "moment's silence on quite a different matter. \"I dare say he'd tell\r\n",
      "YOU--wouldn't he?--if he were to give her any considerable sum.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had only obeyed his injunction, but he stared at the length of her\r\n",
      "jump. \"He might attempt to do so, but I shouldn't at all like it.\"\r\n",
      "He was moved immediately to dismiss this branch of the subject\r\n",
      "and, apparently to help himself, take up another. \"Do you mean she\r\n",
      "understands he has asked her down for a regular long stay?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook barely hesitated. \"She understands, I think, that what I\r\n",
      "expect of her is to make it as long as possible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank laughed out--as it was even after ten years still possible to\r\n",
      "laugh--at the childlike innocence with which her voice could invest the\r\n",
      "hardest teachings of life; then with something a trifle nervous in the\r\n",
      "whole sound and manner he sprang up from his chair. \"What a blessing he\r\n",
      "is to us all!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but think what we must be to HIM.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An immense interest, no doubt.\" He took a few aimless steps and,\r\n",
      "stooping over a basket of flowers, inhaled it with violence, almost\r\n",
      "buried his face. \"I dare say we ARE interesting.\" He had spoken rather\r\n",
      "vaguely, but Mrs. Brook knew exactly why. \"We render him no end of a\r\n",

      "great striped sun-blind beneath which and between the flower-pots of the\r\n",
      "balcony he could see a stretch of hot relaxed street. He looked a minute\r\n",
      "at these things. \"I do so like your phrases!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had a pause that challenged his tone. \"Do you call mamma a\r\n",

      "smoking-room.\" Mrs. Brook's stare was serious, and Vanderbank now went\r\n",
      "on as if the sound of his voice helped him to meet it. \"We had things\r\n",

      "Something in Vanderbank's present study of the signs accordingly showed\r\n",
      "he had had to learn to feel his way and had more or less mastered the\r\n",
      "trick. That she had turned a little pale was really the one fresh\r\n",
      "mark. \"'Funked' it? Why in the world--?\" His own colour deepened at her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her lovely gaze widened out. \"Comment donc? Where--why? You HAVE\r\n",
      "declined her?\" she went on. After which, as he replied only with a slow\r\n",
      "head-shake that seemed to say it was not for the moment all so simple as\r\n",
      "that, she had one of the inspirations to which she was constitutionally\r\n",

      "\"I'm taking my time.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The words appeared for an instant to strike her companion. \"Is it? Is\r\n",
      "it?\" he almost musingly repeated. But he shook himself the next moment\r\n",
      "free of his wonder, was more what would have been called in Buckingham\r\n",
      "Crescent on the spot. \"Isn't there rather something in my having thus\r\n",

      "a monster are you trying to make me out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear lady\"--Vanderbank was prompt--\"I really don't think I say\r\n",
      "anything but what's fair. Isn't it just my loyalty to you in fact that\r\n",
      "has in this case positively strained my discretion?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She shook her head in mere mild despair. \"'Loyalty' again is exquisite.\r\n",
      "The tact of men has a charm quite its own. And you're rather good,\" she\r\n",
      "continued, \"as men go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His laugh was now a little awkward, as if she had already succeeded\r\n",
      "in making him uncomfortable. \"I always become aware with you sooner or\r\n",
      "later that they don't go at all--in your sense: but how am I, after all,\r\n",
      "so far out if you HAVE put your money on another man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You keep coming back to that?\" she wearily sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought a little. \"No, then. You've only to tell me not to, and I'll\r\n",
      "never speak of it again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll be in an odd position for speaking of it if you do really go in.\r\n",

      "you've allowed our friend to hope.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank met it bravely. \"Yes, I think he hopes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And communicates his hope to my child?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This arrested the young man, but only for a moment. \"I've the most\r\n",
      "perfect faith in his wisdom with her. I trust his particular delicacy.\r\n",
      "He cares more for her,\" he presently added, \"even than we do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook gazed away at the infinite of space. \"'We,' my dear Van,\"\r\n",
      "she at last returned, \"is one of your own real, wonderful touches. But\r\n",
      "there's something in what you say: I HAVE, as between ourselves--between\r\n",
      "me and him--been backing Mitchy. That is I've been saying to him 'Wait,\r\n",
      "wait: don't at any rate do anything else.' Only it's just from the\r\n",
      "depth of my thought for my daughter's happiness that I've clung to this\r\n",
      "resource. He would so absolutely, so unreservedly do anything for her.\"\r\n",
      "She had reached now, with her extraordinary self-control, the pitch of\r\n",
      "quiet bland demonstration. \"I want the poor thing, que diable, to have\r\n",
      "another string to her bow and another loaf, for her desolate old age, on\r\n",
      "the shelf. When everything else is gone Mitchy will still be there. Then\r\n",
      "it will be at least her own fault--!\" Mrs. Brook continued. \"What can\r\n",
      "relieve me of the primary duty of taking precautions,\" she wound up,\r\n",
      "\"when I know as well as that I stand here and look at you--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, what?\" he asked as she just paused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why that so far as they count on you they count, my dear Van, on a\r\n",
      "blank.\" Holding him a minute as with the soft low voice of his fate, she\r\n",
      "sadly but firmly shook her head. \"You won't do it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" he almost too loudly protested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You won't do it,\" she went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I SAY!\"--he made a joke of it.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was as if he couldn't at last but show himself really struck; yet\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Mitchett!\" the butler, appearing at the door, almost familiarly\r\n",
      "dropped; after which Vanderbank turned straight to the person announced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mitchett was there, and, anticipating Mrs. Brook in receiving him,\r\n",
      "her companion passed it straighten. \"She's magnificent!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy was already all interest. \"Rather! But what's her last?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been, though so great, so subtle, as they said in Buckingham\r\n",
      "Crescent, that Vanderbank scarce knew how to put it. \"Well, she's so\r\n",
      "thoroughly superior.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh to whom do you say it?\" Mitchy cried as he greeted her.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The subject of this eulogy had meanwhile returned to her sofa, where she\r\n",
      "received the homage of her new visitor. \"It's not I who am magnificent\r\n",
      "a bit--it's dear Mr. Longdon. I've just had from Van the most wonderful\r\n",
      "piece of news about him--his announcement of his wish to make it worth\r\n",
      "somebody's while to marry my child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Make it'?\"--Mitchy stared. \"But ISN'T it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear friend, you must ask Van. Of course you've always thought\r\n",
      "so. But I must tell you all the same,\" Mrs. Brook went on, \"that I'm\r\n",
      "delighted.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy had seated himself, but Vanderbank remained erect and became\r\n",
      "perhaps even slightly stiff. He was not angry--no member of the inner\r\n",
      "circle at Buckingham Crescent was ever angry--but he looked grave\r\n",
      "and rather troubled. \"Even if it IS decidedly fine\"--he addressed his\r\n",
      "hostess straight--\"I can't make out quite why you're doing THIS--I mean\r\n",
      "immediately making it known.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but what do we keep from Mitchy?\" Mrs. Brook asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What CAN you keep? It comes to the same thing,\" Mitchy said. \"Besides,\r\n",
      "here we are together, share and share alike--one beautiful intelligence.\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's 'somebody' is of course Van. Don't try to treat me as an\r\n",
      "outsider.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank looked a little foolishly, though it was but the shade of a\r\n",
      "shade, from one of them to the other. \"I think I've been rather an ass!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What then by the terms of our friendship--just as Mitchy says--can he\r\n",
      "and I have a better right to know and to feel with you about? You'll\r\n",
      "want, Mitchy, won't you?\" Mrs. Brook went on, \"to hear all about THAT?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I only mean,\" Vanderbank explained, \"in having just now blurted my\r\n",
      "tale out to you. However, I of course do know,\" he pursued to Mitchy,\r\n",
      "\"that whatever's really between us will remain between us. Let me then\r\n",
      "tell you myself exactly what's the matter.\" The length of his pause\r\n",
      "after these words showed at last that he had stopped short; on which his\r\n",
      "companions, as they waited, exchanged a sympathetic look. They waited\r\n",
      "another minute, and then he dropped into a chair where, leaning forward,\r\n",
      "his elbows on the arms and his gaze attached to the carpet, he drew out\r\n",
      "the silence. Finally he looked at Mrs. Brook. \"YOU make it clear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The appeal called up for some reason her most infantine manner. \"I don't\r\n",
      "think I CAN, dear Van--really CLEAR. You know however yourself,\" she\r\n",
      "continued to Mitchy, \"enough by this time about Mr. Longdon and mamma.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh rather!\" Mitchy laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And about mamma and Nanda.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh perfectly: the way Nanda reminds him, and the 'beautiful loyalty'\r\n",
      "that has made him take such a fancy to her. But I've already embraced\r\n",
      "the facts--you needn't dot any i's.\" With another glance at his fellow\r\n",
      "visitor Mitchy jumped up and stood there florid. \"He has offered you\r\n",
      "money to marry her.\" He said this to Vanderbank as if it were the most\r\n",
      "natural thing in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh NO\" Mrs. Brook interposed with promptitude: \"he has simply let him\r\n",
      "know before any one else that the money's there FOR Nanda, and that\r\n",
      "therefore--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"First come first served?\" Mitchy had already taken her up. \"I see, I\r\n",
      "see. Then to make her sure of the money,\" he put to Vanderbank, \"you\r\n",
      "MUST marry her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If it depends upon that she'll never get it,\" Mrs. Brook returned.\r\n",
      "\"Dear Van will think conscientiously a lot about it, but he won't do\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Won't you, Van, really?\" Mitchy asked from the hearth-rug.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never, never. We shall be very kind to him, we shall help him, hope and\r\n",
      "pray for him, but we shall be at the end,\" said Mrs. Brook, \"just where\r\n",
      "we are now. Dear Van will have done his best, and we shall have done\r\n",
      "ours. Mr. Longdon will have done his--poor Nanda even will have done\r\n",
      "hers. But it will all have been in vain. However,\" Mrs. Brook continued\r\n",
      "to expound, \"she'll probably have the money. Mr. Longdon will surely\r\n",
      "consider that she'll want it if she doesn't marry still more than if she\r\n",
      "does. So we shall be SO much at least,\" she wound up--\"I mean Edward and\r\n",
      "I and the child will be--to the good.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, for an equal certainty, required but an instant's thought. \"Oh\r\n",
      "there can be no doubt about THAT. The things about which your mind may\r\n",
      "now be at ease--!\" he cheerfully exclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It does make a great difference!\" Mrs. Brook comfortably sighed. Then\r\n",
      "in a different tone: \"What dear Van will find at the end that he\r\n",
      "can't face will be, don't you see? just this fact of appearing to have\r\n",
      "accepted a bribe. He won't want, on the one hand--out of kindness for\r\n",
      "Nanda--to have the money suppressed; and yet he won't want to have the\r\n",
      "pecuniary question mixed up with the matter: to look in short as if he\r\n",
      "had had to be paid. He's like you, you know--he's proud; and it will be\r\n",
      "there we shall break down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy had been watching his friend, who, a few minutes before\r\n",
      "perceptibly embarrassed, had quite recovered himself and, at his ease,\r\n",
      "though still perhaps with a smile a trifle strained, leaned back and let\r\n",
      "his eyes play everywhere but over the faces of the others. Vanderbank\r\n",
      "evidently wished now to show a good-humoured detachment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See here,\" Mitchy said to him: \"I remember your once submitting to me a\r\n",
      "case of some delicacy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh he'll submit it to you--he'll submit it even to ME\" Mrs. Brook broke\r\n",
      "in. \"He'll be charming, touching, confiding--above all he'll be awfully\r\n",
      "INTERESTING about it. But he'll make up his mind in his own way, and his\r\n",
      "own way won't be to accommodate Mr. Longdon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy continued to study their companion in the light of these remarks,\r\n",
      "then turned upon his hostess his sociable glare. \"Splendid, isn't it,\r\n",
      "the old boy's infatuation with him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook just delayed. \"From the point of view of the immense interest\r\n",
      "it--just now, for instance--makes for you and me? Oh yes, it's one of\r\n",
      "our best things yet. It places him a little with Lady Fanny--'He will,\r\n",
      "he won't; he won't, he will!' Only, to be perfect, it lacks, as I say,\r\n",
      "the element of real suspense.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy frankly wondered. \"It does, you think? Not for me--not wholly.\"\r\n",

      "yourself totally either?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, cultivating his detachment, made at first no more reply\r\n",
      "than if he had not heard, and the others meanwhile showed faces that\r\n",
      "testified perhaps less than their respective speeches had done to the\r\n",
      "absence of anxiety. The only token he immediately gave was to get up and\r\n",
      "approach Mitchy, before whom he stood a minute laughing kindly enough,\r\n",
      "though not altogether gaily. As if then for a better proof of gaiety\r\n",
      "he presently seized him by the shoulders and, still without speaking,\r\n",
      "pushed him backward into the chair he himself had just quitted. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook's eyes, from the sofa, while this went on, attached themselves to\r\n",
      "her visitors. It took Vanderbank, as he moved about and his companions\r\n",
      "waited, a minute longer to produce what he had in mind. \"What IS\r\n",
      "splendid, as we call it, is this extraordinary freedom and good humour\r\n",
      "of our intercourse and the fact that we do care--so independently of our\r\n",
      "personal interests, with so little selfishness or other vulgarity--to\r\n",
      "get at the idea of things. The beautiful specimen Mrs. Brook had just\r\n",
      "given me of that,\" he continued to Mitchy, \"was what made me break\r\n",
      "out to you about her when you came in.\" He spoke to one friend, but he\r\n",
      "looked at the other. \"What's really 'superior' in her is that, though\r\n",
      "I suddenly show her an interference with a favourite plan, her personal\r\n",
      "resentment's nothing--all she wants is to see what may really happen, to\r\n",
      "take in the truth of the case and make the best of that. She offers me\r\n",
      "the truth, as she sees it, about myself, and with no nasty elation if\r\n",
      "it does chance to be the truth that suits her best. It was a charming,\r\n",
      "charming stroke.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy's appreciation was no bar to his amusement. \"You're wonderfully\r\n",
      "right about us. But still it was a stroke.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If Mrs. Brook was less diverted she followed perhaps more closely. \"If\r\n",
      "you do me so much justice then, why did you put to me such a cold cruel\r\n",
      "question?--I mean when you so oddly challenged me on my handing on your\r\n",
      "news to Mitchy. If the principal beauty of our effort to live together\r\n",
      "is--and quite according to your own eloquence--in our sincerity, I\r\n",
      "simply obeyed the impulse to do the sincere thing. If we're not sincere\r\n",
      "we're nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing!\"--it was Mitchy who first responded. \"But we ARE sincere.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, we ARE sincere,\" Vanderbank presently said. \"It's a great chance\r\n",
      "for us not to fall below ourselves: no doubt therefore we shall continue\r\n",
      "to soar and sing. We pay for it, people who don't like us say, in our\r\n",
      "self-consciousness--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But people who don't like us,\" Mitchy broke in, \"don't matter. Besides,\r\n",
      "how can we be properly conscious of each other--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it!\"--Vanderbank completed his idea: \"without my finding myself\r\n",
      "for instance in you and Mrs. Brook? We see ourselves reflected--we're\r\n",
      "conscious of the charming whole. I thank you,\" he pursued after an\r\n",
      "instant to Mrs. Brook--\"I thank you for your sincerity.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a business sometimes really to hold her eyes, but they had,\r\n",
      "it must be said for her, their steady moments. She exchanged with\r\n",
      "Vanderbank a somewhat remarkable look, then, with an art of her own,\r\n",
      "broke short off without appearing to drop him. \"The thing is, don't you\r\n",
      "think?\"--she appealed to Mitchy--\"for us not to be so awfully clever\r\n",
      "as to make it believed that we can never be simple. We mustn't see TOO\r\n",
      "tremendous things--even in each other.\" She quite lost patience with the\r\n",
      "danger she glanced at. \"We CAN be simple!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We CAN, by God!\" Mitchy laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, we are now--and it's a great comfort to have it settled,\" said\r\n",
      "Vanderbank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you see,\" Mrs. Brook returned, \"what a mistake you'd make to see\r\n",
      "abysses of subtlety in my having been merely natural.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We CAN be natural,\" Mitchy declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We can, by God!\" Vanderbank laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook had turned to Mitchy. \"I just wanted you to know. So I spoke.\r\n",
      "It's not more complicated than that. As for WHY I wanted you to know--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What better reason could there be,\" Mitchy interrupted, \"than your\r\n",
      "being filled to the finger-tips with the sense of how I would want it\r\n",
      "myself, and of the misery, the absolute pathos, of my being left out?\r\n",
      "Fancy, my dear chap\"--he had only to put it to Van--\"my NOT knowing!\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank evidently couldn't fancy it, but he said quietly enough: \"I\r\n",
      "should have told you myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what's the difference?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh there IS a difference,\" Mrs. Brook loyally said. Then she opened\r\n",
      "an inch or two, for Vanderbank, the door of her dim radiance. \"Only\r\n",
      "I should have thought it a difference for the better. Of course,\" she\r\n",
      "added, \"it remains absolutely with us three alone, and don't you already\r\n",
      "feel from it the fresh charm--with it here between us--of our being\r\n",
      "together?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was as if each of the men had waited for the other to assent better\r\n",
      "than he himself could and Mitchy then, as Vanderbank failed, had\r\n",
      "gracefully, to cover him, changed the subject. \"But isn't Nanda, the\r\n",
      "person most interested, to know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank gave on this a strange sound of hilarity. \"Ah that would\r\n",
      "finish it off!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It produced for a few seconds something like a chill, a chill that had\r\n",
      "for consequence a momentary pause which in its turn added weight to the\r\n",
      "words next uttered. \"It's not I who shall tell her,\" Mrs. Brook said\r\n",
      "gently and gravely. \"There!--you may be sure. If you want a promise,\r\n",
      "it's a promise. So that if Mr. Longdon's silent,\" she went on, \"and you\r\n",
      "are, Mitchy, and I am, how in the world shall she have a suspicion?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean of course except by Van's deciding to mention it himself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van might have been, from the way they looked at him, some beautiful\r\n",
      "unconscious object; but Mrs. Brook was quite ready to answer. \"Oh poor\r\n",
      "man, HE'LL never breathe.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see. So there we are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this discussion the subject of it had for the time nothing to\r\n",
      "contribute, even when Mitchy, rising with the words he had last uttered\r\n",
      "from the chair in which he had been placed, took sociably as well, on\r\n",
      "the hearth-rug, a position before their hostess. This move ministered\r\n",
      "apparently to Vanderbank's mere silence, for it was still without\r\n",
      "speaking that, after a little, he turned away from his friend and\r\n",
      "dropped once more into the same seat. \"I've shown you already, you of\r\n",
      "course remember,\" Vanderbank presently said to him, \"that I'm perfectly\r\n",
      "aware of how much better Mrs. Brook would like YOU for the position.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He thinks I want him myself,\" Mrs. Brook blandly explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was indeed, as they always thought her, \"wonderful,\" but she was\r\n",
      "perhaps not even now so much so as Mitchy found himself able to be. \"But\r\n",
      "how would you lose old Van--even at the worst?\" he earnestly asked of\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She just hesitated. \"What do you mean by the worst?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then even at the best,\" Mitchy smiled. \"In the event of his falsifying\r\n",
      "your prediction; which, by the way, has the danger, hasn't it?--I mean\r\n",
      "for your intellectual credit--of making him, as we all used to be called\r\n",
      "by our nursemaids, 'contrairy.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I've thought of that,\" Mrs. Brook returned. \"But he won't do, on the\r\n",
      "whole, even for the sweetness of spiting me, what he won't want to do.\r\n",
      "_I_ haven't said I should lose him,\" she went on; \"that's only the view\r\n",
      "he himself takes--or, to do him perfect justice, the idea he candidly\r\n",
      "imputes to me; though without, I imagine--for I don't go so far as\r\n",
      "that--attributing to me anything so unutterably bete as a feeling of\r\n",
      "jealousy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You wouldn't dream of my supposing anything inept of you,\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "said on this, \"if you understood to the full how I keep on admiring you.\r\n",
      "Only what stupefies me a little,\" he continued, \"is the extraordinary\r\n",
      "critical freedom--or we may call it if we like the high intellectual\r\n",
      "detachment--with which we discuss a question touching you, dear\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, so nearly and engaging so your private and most sacred\r\n",
      "sentiments. What are we playing with, after all, but the idea of Nanda's\r\n",
      "happiness?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'm not playing!\" Mrs. Brook declared with a little rattle of\r\n",
      "emotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's not playing\"--Mr. Mitchett gravely confirmed it. \"Don't you\r\n",
      "feel in the very air the vibration of the passion that she's simply too\r\n",
      "charming to shake at the window as the housemaid shakes the tablecloth\r\n",
      "or the jingo the flag?\" Then he took up what Vanderbank had previously\r\n",
      "said. \"Of course, my dear man, I'm 'aware,' as you just now put it, of\r\n",
      "everything, and I'm not indiscreet, am I, Mrs. Brook? in admitting for\r\n",
      "you as well as for myself that there WAS an impossibility you and I used\r\n",
      "sometimes to turn over together. Only--Lord bless us all!--it isn't as\r\n",
      "if I hadn't long ago seen that there's nothing at all FOR me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah wait, wait!\" Mrs. Brook put in. \"She has a theory\"--Vanderbank, from\r\n",
      "his chair, lighted it up for Mitchy, who hovered before them--\"that your\r\n",
      "chance WILL come, later on, after I've given my measure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but that's exactly,\" Mitchy was quick to respond, \"what you'll never\r\n",
      "do! You won't give your measure the least little bit. You'll walk in\r\n",
      "magnificent mystery 'later on' not a bit less than you do today;\r\n",
      "you'll continue to have the benefit of everything that our imagination,\r\n",
      "perpetually engaged, often baffled and never fatigued, will continue\r\n",
      "to bedeck you with. Nanda, in the same way, to the end of all her time,\r\n",
      "will simply remain exquisite, or genuine, or generous--whatever we\r\n",
      "choose to call it. It may make a difference to us, who are comparatively\r\n",
      "vulgar, but what difference will it make to HER whether you do or you\r\n",
      "don't decide for her? You can't belong to her more, for herself, than\r\n",
      "you do already--and that's precisely so much that there's no room for\r\n",
      "any one else. Where therefore, without that room, do I come in?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nowhere, I see,\" Vanderbank seemed obligingly to muse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook had followed Mitchy with marked admiration, but she gave on\r\n",
      "this a glance at Van that was like the toss of a blossom from the same\r\n",
      "branch. \"Oh then shall I just go on with you BOTH? That WILL be joy!\"\r\n",
      "She had, however, the next thing, a sudden drop which shaded the\r\n",
      "picture. \"You're so divine, Mitchy, that how can you not in the long-run\r\n",
      "break ANY woman down?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not as if Mitchy was struck--it was only that he was courteous.\r\n",
      "\"What do you call the long-run? Taking about till I'm eighty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah your genius is of a kind to which middle life will be particularly\r\n",
      "favourable. You'll reap then somehow, one feels, everything you've\r\n",
      "sown.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy still accepted the prophecy only to control it. \"Do you call\r\n",
      "eighty middle life? Why, my moral beauty, my dear woman--if that's what\r\n",
      "you mean by my genius--is precisely my curse. What on earth--is left for\r\n",
      "a man just rotten with goodness? It renders necessary the kind of liking\r\n",
      "that renders unnecessary anything else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now that IS cheap paradox!\" Vanderbank patiently sighed. \"You're down\r\n",
      "for a fine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was with less of the patience perhaps that Mrs. Brook took this up.\r\n",
      "\"Yes, on that we ARE stiff. Five pounds, please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy drew out his pocket-book even though he explained. \"What I mean\r\n",
      "is that I don't give out the great thing.\" With which he produced a\r\n",
      "crisp banknote.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"DON'T you?\" asked Vanderbank, who, having taken it from him to hand to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, held it a moment, delicately, to accentuate the doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The great thing's the sacred terror. It's you who give THAT out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\"--and Vanderbank laid the money on the small stand at Mrs. Brook's\r\n",
      "elbow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ain't I right, Mrs. Brook?--doesn't he, tremendously, and isn't that\r\n",
      "more than anything else what does it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two again, as if they understood each other, gazed in a unity\r\n",
      "of interest at their companion, who sustained it with an air clearly\r\n",
      "intended as the happy mean between embarrassment and triumph. Then Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook showed she liked the phrase. \"The sacred terror! Yes, one feels\r\n",
      "it. It IS that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The finest case of it,\" Mitchy pursued, \"that I've ever met. So my\r\n",
      "moral's sufficiently pointed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't think it can be said to be that,\" Vanderbank returned, \"till\r\n",
      "you've put the whole thing into a box by doing for Nanda what she does\r\n",
      "most want you to do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy caught on without a shade of wonder. \"Oh by proposing to the\r\n",
      "Duchess for little Aggie?\" He took but an instant to turn it over.\r\n",
      "\"Well, I WOULD propose--to please Nanda. Only I've never yet quite made\r\n",
      "out the reason of her wish.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The reason is largely,\" his friend answered, \"that, being very fond of\r\n",
      "Aggie and in fact extremely admiring her, she wants to do something\r\n",
      "good for her and to keep her from anything bad. Don't you know--it's\r\n",
      "too charming--she regularly believes in her?\" Mitchy, with all his\r\n",
      "recognition, vibrated to the touch. \"Isn't it too charming?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then,\" Vanderbank went on, \"she secures for her friend a phoenix\r\n",
      "like you, and secures for you a phoenix like her friend. It's hard to\r\n",
      "say for which of you she desires most to do the handsome thing. She\r\n",
      "loves you both in short\"--he followed it up--\"though perhaps when one\r\n",
      "thinks of it the price she puts on you, Mitchy, in the arrangement, is\r\n",
      "a little the higher. Awfully fine at any rate--and yet awfully odd\r\n",
      "too--her feeling for Aggie's type, which is divided by such abysses from\r\n",
      "her own.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" laughed Mitchy, \"but think then of her feeling for mine!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, still more at his ease now and with his head back, had\r\n",
      "his eyes aloft and far. \"Oh there are things in Nanda--!\" The others\r\n",
      "exchanged a glance at this, while their companion added: \"Little Aggie's\r\n",
      "really the sort of creature she would have liked to be able to be.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Mitchy said, \"I should have adored her even if she HAD been\r\n",
      "able.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook had for some minutes played no audible part, but the acute\r\n",
      "observer we are constantly taking for granted would perhaps have\r\n",
      "detected in her, as one of the effects of the special complexion to-day\r\n",
      "of Vanderbank's presence, a certain smothered irritation. \"She couldn't\r\n",
      "possibly have been able,\" she now interposed, \"with so loose--or rather,\r\n",
      "to express it more properly, with so perverse--a mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet, my dear lady,\" Mitchy promptly qualified, \"how if in little\r\n",
      "Aggie's case the Duchess hasn't prevented--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook was full of wisdom. \"Well, it's a different thing. I'm not,\r\n",
      "as a mother--am I, Van?--bad ENOUGH. That's what's the matter with me.\r\n",
      "Aggie, don't you see? is the Duchess's morality, her virtue; which, by\r\n",
      "having it that way outside of you, as one may say, you can make a much\r\n",
      "better thing of. The child has been for Jane, I admit, a capital little\r\n",
      "subject, but Jane has kept her on hand and finished her like some\r\n",
      "wonderful piece of stitching. Oh as work it's of a soigne! There it\r\n",
      "is--to show. A woman like me has to be HERSELF, poor thing, her virtue\r\n",
      "and her morality. What will you have? It's our lumbering English plan.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So that her daughter,\" Mitchy sympathised, \"can only, by the\r\n",
      "arrangement, hope to become at the best her immorality and her vice?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mrs. Brook, without an answer for the question, appeared suddenly to\r\n",
      "have plunged into a sea of thought. \"The only way for Nanda to have been\r\n",
      "REALLY nice--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Would have been for YOU to be like Jane?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy and his hostess seemed for a minute, on this, to gaze together\r\n",
      "at the tragic truth. Then she shook her head. \"We see our mistakes\r\n",
      "too late.\" She repeated the movement, but as if to let it all go, and\r\n",
      "Vanderbank meanwhile, pulling out his watch, had got up with a laugh\r\n",
      "that showed some inattention and made to Mitchy a remark about their\r\n",
      "walking away together. Mitchy, engaged for the instant with Mrs. Brook,\r\n",
      "had assented only with a nod, but the attitude of the two men had become\r\n",
      "that of departure. Their friend looked at them as if she would like to\r\n",
      "keep one of them, and for a purpose connected somehow with the other,\r\n",
      "but was oddly, almost ludicrously, embarrassed to choose. What was in\r\n",
      "her face indeed during this short passage might prove to have been,\r\n",
      "should we penetrate, the flicker of a sense that in spite of all\r\n",
      "intimacy and amiability they could, at bottom and as things commonly\r\n",
      "turned out, only be united against her. Yet she made at the end a sort\r\n",
      "of choice in going on to Mitchy: \"He hasn't at all told you the real\r\n",
      "reason of Nanda's idea that you should go in for Aggie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I draw the line there,\" said Vanderbank. \"Besides, he understands\r\n",
      "that too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, on the spot, did himself and every one justice. \"Why it just\r\n",
      "disposes of me, doesn't it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It made Vanderbank, restless now and turning about the room, stop with a\r\n",
      "smile at Mrs. Brook. \"We understand too well!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not if he doesn't understand,\" she replied after a moment while she\r\n",
      "turned to Mitchy, \"that his real 'combination' can in the nature of the\r\n",
      "case only be--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes\"--Mitchy took her straight up--\"with the young thing who is, as\r\n",
      "you say, positively and helplessly modern and the pious fraud of whose\r\n",
      "classic identity with a sheet of white paper has been--ah tacitly\r\n",
      "of course, but none the less practically!--dropped. You've so often\r\n",
      "reminded me. I do understand. If I were to go in for Aggie it would only\r\n",

      "of her inevitable consciousness of them just as they are--she, wonderful\r\n",
      "being, IS, I fully recognise, my real affair, and I'm not ashamed to say\r\n",
      "that when I like the individual I'm not afraid of the type. She knows\r\n",
      "too much--I don't say; but she doesn't know after all a millionth part\r\n",
      "of what _I_ do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not sure!\" Mrs. Brook earnestly exclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had rung out and he kept it up with a limpidity unusual. \"And product\r\n",
      "for product, when you come to that, I'm a queerer one myself than any\r\n",
      "other. The traditions _I_ smash!\" Mitchy laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook had got up and Vanderbank had gone again to the window.\r\n",
      "\"That's exactly why,\" she returned. \"You're a pair of monsters and your\r\n",
      "monstrosity fits. She does know too much,\" she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mitchy with resolution, \"it's all my fault.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not ALL--unless,\" Mrs. Brook returned, \"that's only a sweet way of\r\n",
      "saying that it's mostly mine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yours too--immensely; in fact every one's. Even Edward's, I dare\r\n",
      "say; and certainly, unmistakably, Harold's. Ah and Van's own--rather!\"\r\n",
      "Mitchy continued; \"for all he turns his back and will have nothing to\r\n",
      "say to it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was on the back Vanderbank turned that Mrs. Brook's eyes now rested.\r\n",
      "\"That's precisely why he shouldn't be afraid of her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He faced straight about. \"Oh I don't deny my part.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He shone at them brightly enough, and Mrs. Brook, thoughtful, wistful,\r\n",
      "candid, took in for a moment the radiance. \"And yet to think that after\r\n",
      "all it has been mere TALK!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something in her tone again made her hearers laugh out; so it was still\r\n",
      "with the air of good humour that Vanderbank answered: \"Mere, mere, mere.\r\n",
      "But perhaps it's exactly the 'mere' that has made us range so wide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook's intelligence abounded. \"You mean that we haven't had the\r\n",
      "excuse of passion?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companions once more gave way to mirth, but \"There you are!\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank said after an instant less sociably. With it too he held out\r\n",
      "his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You ARE afraid,\" she answered as she gave him her own; on which, as\r\n",
      "he made no rejoinder, she held him before her. \"Do you mean you REALLY\r\n",
      "don't know if she gets it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The money, if he DOESN'T go in?\"--Mitchy broke almost with an air\r\n",
      "of responsibility into Vanderbank's silence. \"Ah but, as we said,\r\n",
      "surely--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was by this time off, but Mrs. Brook kept Mitchy a moment. \"Now--by\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her visitors had been gone half an hour, but she was still in the\r\n",
      "drawing-room when Nanda came back. The girl found her, on the sofa, in a\r\n",
      "posture that might have represented restful oblivion, but that, after\r\n",
      "a glance, our young lady appeared to interpret as mere intensity of\r\n",
      "thought. It was a condition from which at all events Mrs. Brook was\r\n",
      "quickly roused by her daughter's presence: she opened her eyes and put\r\n",
      "down her feet, so that the two were confronted as closely as persons\r\n",
      "may be when it is only one of them who looks at the other. Nanda, gazing\r\n",
      "vaguely about and not seeking a seat, slowly drew off her gloves while\r\n",
      "her mother's sad eyes considered her from top to toe. \"Tea's gone,\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook then said as if there were something in the loss peculiarly\r\n",
      "irretrievable. \"But I suppose,\" she added, \"he gave you all you want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear yes, thank you--I've had lots.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda hovered there slim and charming, feathered and ribboned, dressed\r\n",
      "in thin fresh fabrics and faint colours, with something in the effect\r\n",
      "of it all to which the sweeter deeper melancholy in her mother's eyes\r\n",
      "seemed happily to testify. \"Just turn round, dear.\" The girl immediately\r\n",
      "obeyed, and Mrs. Brook once more took everything in. \"The back's\r\n",
      "best--only she didn't do what she said she would. How they do lie!\" she\r\n",
      "gently quavered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but we lie so to THEM.\" Nanda had swung round again, producing\r\n",
      "evidently on her mother's part, by the admirable \"hang\" of her light\r\n",
      "skirts, a still deeper peace. \"Do you mean the middle fold?--I knew she\r\n",
      "wouldn't. I don't want my back to be best--I don't walk backward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Mrs. Brook resignedly mused; \"you dress for yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh how can you say that,\" the girl asked, \"when I never stick in a pin\r\n",
      "but what I think of YOU!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Mrs. Brook moralised, \"one must always, I consider, think, as a\r\n",
      "sort of point de repere, of some one good person. Only it's best if it's\r\n",
      "a person one's afraid of. You do very well, but I'm not enough. What\r\n",
      "one really requires is a kind of salutary terror. I never stick in a pin\r\n",
      "without thinking of your Cousin Jane. What is it that some one quotes\r\n",
      "somewhere about some one's having said that 'Our antagonist is our\r\n",
      "helper--he prevents our being superficial'? The extent to which with\r\n",
      "my poor clothes the Duchess prevents ME--!\" It was a measure Mrs. Brook\r\n",
      "could give only by the general soft wail of her submission to fate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, the Duchess isn't a woman, is she? She's a standard.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The speech had for Nanda's companion, however, no effect of pleasantry\r\n",
      "or irony, and it was a mark of the special intercourse of these good\r\n",
      "friends that though they showed each other, in manner and tone, such\r\n",
      "sustained consideration as might almost have given it the stamp of\r\n",
      "diplomacy, there was yet in it also something of that economy of\r\n",
      "expression which is the result of a common experience. The recurrence\r\n",
      "of opportunity to observe them together would have taught a spectator\r\n",
      "that--on Mrs. Brook's side doubtless more particularly--their relation\r\n",
      "was governed by two or three remarkably established and, as might have\r\n",
      "been said, refined laws, the spirit of which was to guard against the\r\n",
      "vulgarity so often coming to the surface between parent and child. That\r\n",
      "they WERE as good friends as if Nanda had not been her daughter was a\r\n",
      "truth that no passage between them might fail in one way or another to\r\n",
      "illustrate. Nanda had gathered up, for that matter, early in life, a\r\n",
      "flower of maternal wisdom: \"People talk about conscience, but it seems\r\n",
      "to me one must just bring it up to a certain point and leave it\r\n",
      "there. You can let your conscience alone if you're nice to the second\r\n",
      "housemaid.\" Mrs. Brook was as \"nice\" to Nanda as she was to Sarah\r\n",
      "Curd--which involved, as may easily be imagined, the happiest conditions\r\n",
      "for Sarah. \"Well,\" she resumed, reverting to the Duchess on a final\r\n",
      "appraisement of the girl's air, \"I really think I do well by you and\r\n",
      "that Jane wouldn't have anything to say to-day. You look awfully like\r\n",
      "mamma,\" she then threw off as if for the first time of mentioning it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Cousin Jane doesn't care for that,\" Nanda returned. \"What I don't\r\n",
      "look like is Aggie, for all I try.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you shouldn't try--you can do nothing with it. One must be what one\r\n",
      "is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook was almost sententious, but Nanda, with civility, let it\r\n",
      "pass. \"No one in London touches her. She's quite by herself. When one\r\n",
      "sees her one feels her to be the real thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, without harshness, wondered. \"What do you mean by the real\r\n",
      "thing?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even Nanda, however, had to think a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, the real young one. That's what Lord Petherton calls her,\" she\r\n",
      "mildly joked--\"'the young 'un'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her mother's echo was not for the joke, but for something else. \"I know\r\n",
      "what you mean. What's the use of being good?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I didn't mean that,\" said Nanda. \"Besides, isn't Aggie of a\r\n",
      "goodness--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wasn't talking of her. I was asking myself what's the use of MY\r\n",
      "being.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you can't help it any more than the Duchess can help--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but she could if she would!\" Mrs. Brook broke in with a sharper\r\n",
      "ring than she had yet given. \"We can't help being good perhaps, if that\r\n",
      "burden's laid on us--but there are lengths in other directions we're not\r\n",
      "absolutely obliged to go. And what I think of when I stick in the pins,\"\r\n",
      "she went on, \"is that Jane seems to me really never to have had to pay.\"\r\n",
      "She appeared for a minute to brood on this till she could no longer\r\n",
      "bear it; after which she jerked out: \"Why she has never had to pay for\r\n",
      "ANYthing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda had by this time seated herself, taking her place, under the\r\n",
      "interest of their talk, on her mother's sofa, where, except for the\r\n",
      "removal of her long soft gloves, which one of her hands again and again\r\n",
      "drew caressingly through the other, she remained very much as if she\r\n",
      "were some friendly yet circumspect young visitor to whom Mrs. Brook had\r\n",
      "on some occasion dropped \"DO come.\" But there was something perhaps more\r\n",
      "expressly conciliatory in the way she had kept everything on: as if, in\r\n",
      "particular serenity and to confirm kindly Mrs. Brook's sense of what had\r\n",
      "been done for her, she had neither taken off her great feathered hat nor\r\n",
      "laid down her parasol of pale green silk, the \"match\" of hat and ribbons\r\n",
      "and which had an expensive precious knob. Our spectator would possibly\r\n",
      "have found too much earnestness in her face to be sure if there was also\r\n",
      "candour. \"And do you mean that YOU have had to pay--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--all the while.\" With this Mrs. Brook was a little short, and\r\n",
      "also as she added as if to banish a slight awkwardness: \"But don't let\r\n",
      "it discourage you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda seemed an instant to weigh the advice, and the whole thing would\r\n",
      "have been striking as another touch in the picture of the odd want, on\r\n",
      "the part of each, of any sense of levity in the other. Whatever escape,\r\n",
      "face to face, mother or daughter might ever seek would never be the\r\n",
      "humorous one--a circumstance, notwithstanding, that would not in every\r\n",
      "case have failed to make their interviews droll for a third person. It\r\n",
      "would always indeed for such a person have produced an impression of\r\n",
      "tension beneath the surface. \"I could have done much better at the start\r\n",
      "and have lost less time,\" the girl at last said, \"if I hadn't had the\r\n",
      "drawback of not really remembering Granny.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh well, _I_ remember her!\" Mrs. Brook moaned with an accent that\r\n",
      "evidently struck her the next moment as so much out of place that she\r\n",
      "slightly deflected. She took Nanda's parasol and held it as if--a more\r\n",
      "delicate thing much than any one of hers--she simply liked to have it.\r\n",
      "\"Her clothes--at your age at least--must have been hideous. Was it at\r\n",
      "the place he took you to that he gave you tea?\" she then went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, at the Museum. We had an orgy in the refreshment-room. But he took\r\n",
      "me afterwards to Tishy's, where we had another.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He went IN with you?\" Mrs. Brook had suddenly flashed into eagerness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--I made him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He didn't want to?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the contrary--very much. But he doesn't do everything he wants,\"\r\n",
      "said Nanda.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook seemed to wonder. \"You mean you've also to want it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no--THAT isn't enough. What I suppose I mean,\" Nanda continued, \"is\r\n",
      "that he doesn't do anything he doesn't want. But he does quite enough,\"\r\n",
      "she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And who then was at Tishy's?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh poor old Tish herself, naturally, and Carrie Donner.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And no one else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl just waited. \"Yes, Mr. Cashmore came in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her mother gave a groan of impatience. \"Ah AGAIN?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda thought an instant. \"How do you mean, 'again'? He just lives there\r\n",
      "as much as he ever did, and Tishy can't prevent him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was thinking of Mr. Longdon--of THEIR meeting. When he met him here\r\n",
      "that time he liked it so little. Did he like it any more to-day?\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook quavered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no, he hated it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But hadn't he--if he should go in--known he WOULD?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, perfectly. But he wanted to see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To see--?\" Mrs. Brook just threw out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, where I go so much. And he knew I wished it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't quite see why,\" Mrs. Brook mildly observed. And then as her\r\n",
      "daughter said nothing to help her: \"At any rate he did loathe it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda, for a reply, simply after an instant put a question. \"Well, how\r\n",
      "can he understand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean, like me, why you do go there so much? How can he indeed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't mean that,\" the girl returned--\"it's just that he understands\r\n",
      "perfectly, because he saw them all, in such an extraordinary way--well,\r\n",
      "what can I ever call it?--clutch me and cling to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, with full gravity, considered this picture. \"And was Mr.\r\n",
      "Cashmore to-day so ridiculous?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah he's not ridiculous, mamma--he's very unhappy. He thinks now Lady\r\n",
      "Fanny probably won't go, but he feels that may be after all only the\r\n",
      "worse for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She WILL go,\" Mrs. Brook answered with one of her roundabout approaches\r\n",
      "to decision. \"He IS too great an idiot. She was here an hour ago, and if\r\n",
      "ever a woman was packed--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Nanda objected, \"but doesn't she spend her time in packing and\r\n",
      "unpacking?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This enquiry, however, scarce pulled up her mother. \"No--though she HAS,\r\n",
      "no doubt, hitherto wasted plenty of labour. She has now a dozen boxes--I\r\n",
      "could see them there in her wonderful eyes--just waiting to be called\r\n",
      "for. So if you're counting on her not going, my dear--!\" Mrs. Brook gave\r\n",
      "a head-shake that was the warning of wisdom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't care what she does!\" Nanda replied. \"What I meant just now\r\n",
      "was that Mr. Longdon couldn't understand why, with so much to make them\r\n",
      "so, they couldn't be decently happy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And did he wish you to explain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I tried to, but I didn't make it any better. He doesn't like them. He\r\n",
      "doesn't even care for Tish.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He told you so--right out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" Nanda said, \"of course I asked him. I didn't press him, because I\r\n",
      "never do--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You never do?\" Mrs. Brook broke in as with the glimpse of a new light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl showed an indulgence for this interest that was for a moment\r\n",
      "almost elderly. \"I enjoy awfully with him seeing just how to take him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her tone and her face evidently put forth for her companion at this\r\n",
      "juncture something freshly, even quite supremely suggestive; and yet the\r\n",
      "effect of them on Mrs. Brook's part was only a question so off-hand that\r\n",
      "it might already often have been asked. The mother's eyes, to ask it,\r\n",
      "we may none the less add, attached themselves closely to the daughter's,\r\n",
      "and her face just glowed. \"You like him so very awfully?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was as if the next instant Nanda felt herself on her guard. Yet she\r\n",
      "spoke with a certain surrender. \"Well, it's rather intoxicating to be\r\n",
      "one's self--!\" She had only a drop over the choice of her term.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So tremendously made up to, you mean--even by a little fussy ancient\r\n",
      "man? But DOESN'T he, my dear,\" Mrs. Brook continued with encouragement,\r\n",
      "\"make up to you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A supposititious spectator would certainly on this have imagined in the\r\n",
      "girl's face the delicate dawn of a sense that her mother had suddenly\r\n",
      "become vulgar, together with a general consciousness that the way\r\n",
      "to meet vulgarity was always to be frank and simple and above all to\r\n",
      "ignore. \"He makes one enjoy being liked so much--liked better, I do\r\n",
      "think, than I've ever been liked by any one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If Mrs. Brook hesitated it was, however, clearly not because she had\r\n",
      "noticed. \"Not better surely than by dear Mitchy? Or even if you come to\r\n",
      "that by Tishy herself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean because he doesn't want to marry you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was as if she had not heard that Nanda continued: \"Well, he's more\r\n",
      "beautiful.\"\r\n",

      "\"Well, to the South Kensington Museum.\"\r\n",

      "necessities, with money, money, money at every turn running away like\r\n",
      "water. The children this year seem to fit into nothing, into nowhere,\r\n",
      "and Harold's more dreadful than he has ever been, doing nothing at all\r\n",
      "for himself and requiring everything to be done for him. He talks about\r\n",
      "his American girl, with millions, who's so awfully taken with him, but\r\n",
      "I can't find out anything about her: the only one, just now, that people\r\n",
      "seem to have heard of is the one Booby Manger's engaged to. The Mangers\r\n",
      "literally snap up everything,\" Mrs. Brook quite wailingly now continued:\r\n",
      "\"the Jew man, so gigantically rich--who is he? Baron Schack or\r\n",

      "little Algie, to do his conversation for him, four hundred a year, which\r\n",
      "Harold pretended to me that, of all the rush of young men--dozens!--HE\r\n",
      "was most in the running for. Your father's settled gloom is terrible,\r\n",
      "and I bear all the brunt of it; we get literally nothing this year for\r\n",
      "the Hovel, yet have to spend on it heaven knows what; and everybody, for\r\n",
      "the next three months, in Scotland and everywhere, has asked us for the\r\n",
      "wrong time and nobody for the right: so that I assure you I don't know\r\n",
      "where to turn--which doesn't however in the least prevent every one\r\n",
      "coming to me with their own selfish troubles.\" It was as if Mrs. Brook\r\n",
      "had found the cup of her secret sorrows suddenly jostled by some touch\r\n",
      "of which the perversity, though not completely noted at the moment,\r\n",
      "proved, as she a little let herself go, sufficient to make it flow over;\r\n",
      "but she drew, the next thing, from her daughter's stillness a reflexion\r\n",
      "of the vanity of such heat and speedily recovered herself as if in order\r\n",
      "with more dignity to point the moral. \"I can carry my burden and shall\r\n",
      "do so to the end; but we must each remember that we shall fall to pieces\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"And what day can you go if I want?\" Mrs. Brook spoke as with a small\r\n",
      "sharpness--just softened indeed in time--produced by the sight of a\r\n",
      "freedom in her daughter's life that suddenly loomed larger than any\r\n",
      "freedom of her own. It was still a part of the unsteadiness of the\r\n",
      "vessel of her anxieties; but she never after all remained publicly long\r\n",
      "subject to the influence she often comprehensively designated to others\r\n",
      "as well as to herself as \"nastiness.\" \"What I mean is that you might go\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It might have been, for the light it quickly produced, exactly what her\r\n",
      "mother had been working to make her say. \"What do you call that then, I\r\n",
      "should like to know, but his adopting you?\"\r\n",

      "footing? Charity, love, begins at home, and if it's a question of merely\r\n",
      "GIVING, you've objects enough for your bounty without going so far.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl, as her stare showed, was held a moment by her surprise, which\r\n",

      "weariness. Nanda, on her side, as if their talk had ended, went across\r\n",
      "to the sofa to take up her parasol before leaving the room, an impulse\r\n",
      "rather favoured than arrested by the arrival of her brother Harold, who\r\n",

      "had for its greatest wonder the extent and colour of its old brick wall,\r\n",
      "in which the pink and purple surface was the fruit of the mild ages\r\n",
      "and the protective function, for a visitor strolling, sitting, talking,\r\n",
      "reading, that of a nurse of reverie. The air of the place, in the August\r\n",
      "time, thrilled all the while with the bliss of birds, the hum of little\r\n",
      "lives unseen and the flicker of white butterflies. It was on the large\r\n",
      "flat enclosed lawn that Nanda spoke to Vanderbank of the three weeks she\r\n",
      "would have completed there on the morrow--weeks that had been--she made\r\n",
      "no secret of it--the happiest she had yet spent anywhere. The greyish\r\n",
      "day was soft and still and the sky faintly marbled, while the more newly\r\n",
      "arrived of the visitors from London, who had come late on the Friday\r\n",
      "afternoon, lounged away the morning in an attitude every relaxed line\r\n",
      "of which referred to the holiday he had, as it were--at first merely\r\n",
      "looking about and victualling--sat down in front of as a captain before\r\n",
      "a city. There were sitting-places, just there, out of the full light,\r\n",
      "cushioned benches in the thick wide spread of old mulberry-boughs. A\r\n",
      "large book of facts lay in the young man's lap, and Nanda had come out\r\n",
      "to him, half an hour before luncheon, somewhat as Beatrice came out to\r\n",
      "Benedick: not to call him immediately indeed to the meal, but mentioning\r\n",
      "promptly that she had come at a bidding. Mr. Longdon had rebuked her, it\r\n",
      "appeared, for her want of attention to their guest, showing her in\r\n",
      "this way, to her pleasure, how far he had gone toward taking her, as he\r\n",
      "called it, into the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've been thinking of yourself,\" Vanderbank asked, \"as a mere clerk\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, longing for a river, was in white flannels, and he took\r\n",
      "her question with a happy laugh, a handsome face of good humour that\r\n",
      "completed the effect of his long, cool fairness. \"Do you mind my just\r\n",
      "sitting still, do you mind letting me smoke and staying with me a while?\r\n",
      "Perhaps after a little we'll walk about--shan't we? But face to face\r\n",
      "with this dear old house, in this jolly old nook, one's too contented\r\n",
      "to move, lest raising a finger even should break the spell. What WILL be\r\n",
      "perfect will be your just sitting down--DO sit down--and scolding me a\r\n",

      "while, near him but in another chair, she fingered the impossible book,\r\n",
      "as she pronounced it, that she had taken from him, he came back to what\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah no--you're too much your mother's daughter for that!\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "leaned back and smoked, and though all his air seemed to say that when\r\n",
      "one was so at ease for gossip almost any subject would do, he kept\r\n",
      "jogging his foot with the same small nervous motion as during the\r\n",
      "half-hour at Mertle that this record has commemorated. \"You're too\r\n",
      "much one of us all,\" he continued. \"We've tremendous perceptions,\"\r\n",
      "he laughed. \"Of course I SHOULD have come for him. But after all,\" he\r\n",
      "added, as if all sorts of nonsense would equally serve, \"he mightn't,\r\n",
      "except for you, you know, have asked me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda so far accepted this view as to reply: \"That's awfully weak. He's\r\n",
      "so modest that he might have been afraid of your boring yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just what I mean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if you do,\" Nanda returned, \"the explanation's a little\r\n",
      "conceited.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I only made it,\" Vanderbank said, \"in reference to his modesty.\"\r\n",
      "Beyond the lawn the house was before him, old, square, red-roofed, well\r\n",
      "assured of its right to the place it took up in the world. This was a\r\n",
      "considerable space--in the little world at least of Suffolk--and the\r\n",
      "look of possession had everywhere mixed with it, in the form of old\r\n",
      "windows and doors, the tone of old red surfaces, the style of old white\r\n",
      "facings, the age of old high creepers, the long confirmation of time.\r\n",
      "Suggestive of panelled rooms, of precious mahogany, of portraits\r\n",
      "of women dead, of coloured china glimmering through glass doors and\r\n",
      "delicate silver reflected on bared tables, the thing was one of those\r\n",
      "impressions of a particular period that it takes two centuries to\r\n",
      "produce. \"Fancy,\" the young man incoherently exclaimed, \"his caring to\r\n",
      "leave anything so loveable as all this to come up and live with US!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl also for a little lost herself. \"Oh you don't know what it\r\n",
      "is--the charm comes out so as one stays. Little by little it grows and\r\n",
      "grows. There are old things everywhere that are too delightful. He\r\n",
      "lets me explore so--he lets me rummage and rifle. Every day I make\r\n",
      "discoveries.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Your mother ought to be here,\" Vanderbank presently suggested. \"She's\r\n",

      "\"Was your grandmother ever?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never,\" the girl promptly said. \"Never,\" she repeated in a tone quite\r\n",

      "comes--try to produce so much of my effect that I shall be safe. But\r\n",
      "what did Mr. Longdon ask him for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Nanda gaily, \"what did he ask YOU for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, for the reason you just now mentioned--that his interest in me is\r\n",
      "so uncontrollable.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then isn't his interest in Mitchy--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of the same general order?\" Vanderbank broke in. \"Not in the least.\"\r\n",
      "He seemed to look for a way to express the distinction--which suddenly\r\n",
      "occurred to him. \"He wasn't in love with Mitchy's mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No\"--Nanda turned it over. \"Mitchy's mother, it appears, was awful. Mr.\r\n",
      "Cashmore knew her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's smoke-puffs were profuse and his pauses frequent. \"Awful\r\n",
      "to Mr. Cashmore? I'm glad to hear it--he must have deserved it. But I\r\n",
      "believe in her all the same. Mitchy's often awful himself,\" the young\r\n",
      "man rambled on. \"Just so I believe in HIM.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So do I,\" said Nanda--\"and that's why I asked him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"YOU asked him, my dear child? Have you the inviting?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The eyes he turned on her seemed really to try if she jested or were\r\n",
      "serious. \"So you arranged for me too?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned over again a few leaves of his book and, closing it with\r\n",
      "something of a clap, transferred it to the bench beside him--a movement\r\n",
      "in which, as if through a drop into thought, he rendered her no\r\n",
      "assistance. \"What I mean is that I proposed it to Mr. Longdon, I\r\n",
      "suggested he should be asked. I've a reason for seeing him--I want\r\n",
      "to talk to him. And do you know,\" the girl went on, \"what Mr. Longdon\r\n",
      "said?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Something splendid of course.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He asked if you wouldn't perhaps dislike his being here with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, throwing back his head, laughed, smoked, jogged his foot\r\n",
      "more than ever. \"Awfully nice. Dear old Mitch! How little afraid of him\r\n",
      "you are!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda wondered. \"Of Mitch?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, of the tremendous pull he really has. It's all very well to\r\n",
      "talk--he HAS it. But of course I don't mean I don't know\"--and as\r\n",
      "with the effect of his nervous sociability he shifted his position. \"I\r\n",
      "perfectly see that you're NOT afraid. I perfectly know what you have in\r\n",
      "your head. I should never in the least dream of accusing you--as far as\r\n",
      "HE is concerned--of the least disposition to flirt; any more indeed,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank pleasantly pursued, \"than even of any general tendency of\r\n",
      "that sort. No, my dear Nanda\"--he kindly kept it up--\"I WILL say for\r\n",
      "you that, though a girl, thank heaven, and awfully MUCH a girl, you're\r\n",
      "really not on the whole more of a flirt than a respectable social ideal\r\n",
      "prescribes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you most tremendously,\" his companion quietly replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something in the tone of it made him laugh out, and the particular sound\r\n",
      "went well with all the rest, with the August day and the charming spot\r\n",
      "and the young man's lounging figure and Nanda's own little hovering\r\n",
      "hospitality. \"Of course I strike you as patronising you with unconscious\r\n",
      "sublimity. Well, that's all right, for what's the most natural thing to\r\n",
      "do in these conditions but the most luxurious? Won't Mitchy be wonderful\r\n",
      "for feeling and enjoying them? I assure you I'm delighted he's coming.\"\r\n",
      "Then in a different tone a moment later, \"Do you expect to be here\r\n",
      "long?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It took Nanda some time to say. \"As long as Mr. Longdon will keep me, I\r\n",
      "suppose--if that doesn't sound very horrible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh he'll keep you! Only won't he himself,\" Vanderbank went on, \"be\r\n",
      "coming up to town in the course of the autumn?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, in that case I'd perfectly stay here without him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And leave him in London without YOU? Ah that's not what we want:\r\n",
      "he wouldn't be at all the same thing without you. Least of all for\r\n",
      "himself!\" Vanderbank declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda again thought. \"Yes, that's what makes him funny, I suppose--his\r\n",
      "curious infatuation. I set him off--what do you call it?--show him\r\n",
      "off: by his going round and round me as the acrobat on the horse in\r\n",
      "the circus goes round the clown. He has said a great deal to me of your\r\n",
      "mother,\" she irrelevantly added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ok everything that's kind of course, or you wouldn't mention it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's what I mean,\" said Nanda.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see, I see--most charming of him.\" Vanderbank kept his high head\r\n",
      "thrown back as for the view, with a bright equal general interest, of\r\n",
      "everything that was before them, whether talked of or seen. \"Who do you\r\n",
      "think I yesterday had a letter from? An extraordinary funny one from\r\n",
      "Harold. He gave me all the family news.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what IS the family news?\" the girl after a minute enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, the first great item is that he himself--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wanted,\" Nanda broke in, \"to borrow five pounds of you? I say that,\"\r\n",
      "she added, \"because if he wrote to you--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It couldn't have been in such a case for the simple pleasure of the\r\n",
      "intercourse?\" Vanderbank hesitated, but continued not to look at her.\r\n",
      "\"What do you know, pray, of poor Harold's borrowings?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know as I know other things. Don't I know everything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"DO you? I should rather ask,\" the young man gaily enough replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why should I not? How should I not? You know what I know.\" Then as to\r\n",
      "explain herself and attenuate a little the sudden emphasis with which\r\n",
      "she had spoken: \"I remember your once telling me that I must take in\r\n",
      "things at my pores.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion stared, but with his laugh again changed his posture.\r\n",
      "\"That you' must--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I do--and you were quite right.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And when did I make this extraordinary charge?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah then,\" said Nanda, \"you admit it IS a charge. It was a long time\r\n",
      "ago--when I was a little girl. Which made it worse!\" she dropped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It made it at all events now for Vanderbank more amusing. \"Ah not\r\n",
      "worse--better!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought a moment. \"Because in that case I mightn't have understood?\r\n",
      "But that I do understand is just what you've always meant.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Always,' my dear Nanda? I feel somehow,\" he rejoined very kindly, \"as\r\n",
      "if you overwhelmed me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You 'feel' as if I did--but the reality is just that I don't. The day\r\n",
      "I overwhelm you, Mr. Van--!\" She let that pass, however; there was too\r\n",
      "much to say about it and there was something else much simpler. \"Girls\r\n",
      "understand now. It has got to be faced, as Tishy says.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh well,\" Vanderbank laughed, \"we don't require Tishy to point that out\r\n",
      "to us. What are we all doing most of the time but trying to face it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doing? Aren't you doing rather something very different? You're just\r\n",
      "trying to dodge it. You're trying to make believe--not perhaps to\r\n",
      "yourselves but to US--that it isn't so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But surely you don't want us to be any worse!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She shook her head with brisk gravity. \"We don't care really what you\r\n",
      "are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His amusement now dropped to her straighter. \"Your 'we' is awfully\r\n",
      "beautiful. It's charming to hear you speak for the whole lovely lot.\r\n",
      "Only you speak, you know, as if you were just the class apart that you\r\n",
      "yet complain of our--by our scruples--implying you to be.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She considered this objection with her eyes on his face. \"Well then we\r\n",
      "do care. Only--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only it's a big subject.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--no doubt; it's a big subject.\" She appeared to wish to meet him\r\n",
      "on everything reasonable. \"Even Mr. Longdon admits that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank wondered. \"You mean you talk over with him--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The subject of girls? Why we scarcely discuss anything else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no wonder then you're not bored. But you mean,\" he asked, \"that he\r\n",
      "recognises the inevitable change--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He can't shut his eyes to the facts. He sees we're quite a different\r\n",
      "thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I dare say\"--her friend was fully appreciative. \"Yet the old\r\n",
      "thing--what do YOU know of it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I personally? Well, I've seen some change even in MY short life. And\r\n",
      "aren't the old books full of us? Then Mr. Longdon himself has told me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank smoked and smoked. \"You've gone into it with him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As far as a man and a woman can together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he took her in at this with a turn of his eye he might have had in\r\n",
      "his ears the echo of all the times it had been dropped in Buckingham\r\n",
      "Crescent that Nanda was \"wonderful.\" She WAS indeed. \"Oh he's of course\r\n",
      "on certain sides shy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Awfully--too beautifully. And then there's Aggie,\" the girl pursued. \"I\r\n",
      "mean for the real old thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, no doubt--if she BE the real old thing. But what the deuce really\r\n",
      "IS Aggie?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Nanda with the frankest interest, \"she's a miracle. If\r\n",
      "one could be her exactly, absolutely, without the least little mite of\r\n",
      "change, one would probably be wise to close with it. Otherwise--except\r\n",
      "for anything BUT that--I'd rather brazen it out as myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There fell between them on this a silence of some minutes, after which\r\n",
      "it would probably not have been possible for either to say if their eyes\r\n",
      "had met while it lasted. This was at any rate not the case as Vanderbank\r\n",
      "at last remarked: \"Your brass, my dear young lady, is pure gold!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then it's of me, I think, that Harold ought to borrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean therefore that mine isn't?\" Vanderbank went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you really haven't any natural 'cheek'--not like SOME of them.\r\n",
      "You're in yourself as uneasy, if anything's said and every one giggles\r\n",
      "or makes some face, as Mr. Longdon, and if Lord Petherton hadn't once\r\n",
      "told me that a man hates almost as much to be called modest as a woman\r\n",
      "does, I'd say that very often in London now you must pass some bad\r\n",
      "moments.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The present might precisely have been one of them, we should doubtless\r\n",
      "have gathered, had we seen fully recorded in Vanderbank's face the\r\n",
      "degree to which this prompt response embarrassed or at least stupefied\r\n",
      "him. But he could always provisionally laugh. \"I like your 'in London\r\n",
      "now'!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's the tone and the current and the effect of all the others that\r\n",
      "push you along,\" she went on as if she hadn't heard him. \"If such things\r\n",
      "are contagious, as every one says, you prove it perhaps as much as any\r\n",
      "one. But you don't begin\"--she continued blandly enough to work it out\r\n",
      "for him; \"or you can't at least originally have begun. Any one would\r\n",
      "know that now--from the terrific effect I see I produce on you--by\r\n",
      "talking this way. There it is--it's all out before one knows it, isn't\r\n",
      "it, and I can't help it any more than you can, can I?\" So she appeared\r\n",
      "to put it to him, with something in her lucidity that would have been\r\n",
      "infinitely touching; a strange grave calm consciousness of their common\r\n",
      "doom and of what in especial in it would be worst for herself. He sprang\r\n",
      "up indeed after an instant as if he had been infinitely touched; he\r\n",
      "turned away, taking just near her a few steps to and fro, gazed about\r\n",
      "the place again, but this time without the air of particularly seeing\r\n",
      "it, and then came back to her as if from a greater distance. An observer\r\n",
      "at all initiated would, at the juncture, fairly have hung on his\r\n",
      "lips, and there was in fact on Vanderbank's part quite the look of the\r\n",
      "man--though it lasted but just while we seize it--in suspense about\r\n",
      "himself. The most initiated observer of all would have been poor Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon, in that case destined, however, to be also the most defeated,\r\n",
      "with the sign of his tension a smothered \"Ah if he doesn't do it NOW!\"\r\n",
      "Well, Vanderbank didn't do it \"now,\" and the odd slow irrelevant sigh he\r\n",
      "gave out might have sufficed as the record of his recovery from a peril\r\n",
      "lasting just long enough to be measured. Had there been any measure of\r\n",
      "it meanwhile for Nanda? There was nothing at least to show either the\r\n",
      "presence or the relief of anxiety in the way in which, by a prompt\r\n",
      "transition, she left her last appeal to him simply to take care of\r\n",
      "itself. \"You haven't denied that Harold does borrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave a sound as of cheer for this luckily firmer ground. \"My dear\r\n",
      "child, I never lent the silly boy five pounds in my life. In fact I like\r\n",
      "the way you talk of that. I don't know quite for what you take me, but\r\n",
      "the number of persons to whom I HAVE lent five pounds--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is so awfully small\"--she took him up on it--\"as not to look so very\r\n",
      "well for you?\" She held him an instant as with the fine intelligence\r\n",
      "of his meaning in this, and then, though not with sharpness, broke out:\r\n",
      "\"Why are you trying to make out that you're nasty and stingy? Why do you\r\n",
      "misrepresent--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My natural generosity? I don't misrepresent anything, but I take, I\r\n",
      "think, rather markedly good care of money.\" She had remained in her\r\n",
      "place and he was before her on the grass, his hands in his pockets and\r\n",
      "his manner perhaps a little awkward. \"The way you young things talk of\r\n",
      "it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Harold talks of it--but I don't think _I_ do. I'm not a bit\r\n",
      "expensive--ask mother, or even ask father. I do with awfully little--for\r\n",
      "clothes and things, and I could easily do with still less. Harold's a\r\n",
      "born consumer, as Mitchy says; he says also he's one of those people who\r\n",
      "will never really want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah for that, Mitchy himself will never let him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, with every one helping us all round, aren't we a lovely\r\n",
      "family? I don't speak of it to tell tales, but when you mention hearing\r\n",
      "from Harold all sorts of things immediately come over me. We seem to be\r\n",
      "all living more or less on other people, all immensely 'beholden.' You\r\n",
      "can easily say of course that I'm worst of all. The children and their\r\n",
      "people, at Bognor, are in borrowed quarters--mother got them lent\r\n",
      "her--as to which, no doubt, I'm perfectly aware that I ought to be there\r\n",
      "sharing them, taking care of my little brother and sister, instead\r\n",
      "of sitting here at Mr. Longdon's expense to expose everything and\r\n",
      "criticise. Father and mother, in Scotland, are on a grand campaign.\r\n",
      "Well\"--she pulled herself up--\"I'm not in THAT at any rate. Say you've\r\n",
      "lent Harold only five shillings,\" she went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank stood smiling. \"Well, say I have. I never lend any one\r\n",
      "whatever more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It only adds to my conviction,\" Nanda explained, \"that he writes to Mr.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But if Mr. Longdon doesn't say so--?\" Vanderbank objected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh that proves nothing.\" She got up as she spoke. \"Harold also works\r\n",
      "Granny.\" He only laughed out at first for this, while she went on:\r\n",
      "\"You'll think I make myself out fearfully deep--I mean in the way of\r\n",
      "knowing everything without having to be told. That IS, as you say,\r\n",
      "mamma's great accomplishment, so it must be hereditary. Besides, there\r\n",
      "seem to me only too many things one IS told. Only Mr. Longdon has in\r\n",
      "fact said nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had looked about responsibly--not to leave in disorder the\r\n",
      "garden-nook they had occupied; picking up a newspaper and changing\r\n",
      "the place of a cushion. \"I do think that with him you're remarkable,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank observed--\"putting on one side all you seem to know and on\r\n",
      "the other all he holds his tongue about. What then DOES he say?\" the\r\n",
      "young man asked after a slight pause and perhaps even with a slight\r\n",
      "irritation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda glanced round again--she was folding, rather carefully, her paper.\r\n",
      "Presently her glance met their friend, who, having come out of one of\r\n",
      "the long windows that opened to the lawn, had stopped there to watch\r\n",
      "them. \"He says just now that luncheon's ready.\"\r\n",

      "a last answer to the not quite sincere chaff his submission had\r\n",
      "engendered, adopted freely and familiarly the prospect not only of a\r\n",
      "grateful freshened lawn, but of a good hour in the very pick, as he\r\n",
      "called it, of his actual happy conditions. The favouring rain, the dear\r\n",

      "measured the great space from end to end, admiring again everything he\r\n",
      "had admired before and protesting afresh that no modern ingenuity--not\r\n",
      "even his own, to which he did justice--could create effects of such\r\n",
      "purity. The final touch in the picture before them was just the\r\n",
      "composer's ignorance. Mr. Longdon had not made his house, he had simply\r\n",
      "lived it, and the \"taste\" of the place--Mitchy in certain connexions\r\n",
      "abominated the word--was just nothing more than the beauty of his life.\r\n",
      "Everything on every side had dropped straight from heaven, with nowhere\r\n",

      "been a wonderful theme for discourse in Buckingham Crescent--so happy an\r\n",
      "exercise for the votaries of that temple of analysis that he repeatedly\r\n",
      "spoke of their experience of it as crying aloud for Mrs. Brook. The\r\n",
      "questions it set in motion for the perceptive mind were exactly those\r\n",
      "that, as he said, most made them feel themselves. Vanderbank's plea for\r\n",
      "his morning had been a pile of letters to work off, and Mitchy--then\r\n",
      "coming down, as he announced from the first, ready for anything--had\r\n",
      "gone to church with Mr. Longdon and Nanda in the finest spirit of\r\n",
      "curiosity. He now--after the girl's remark--turned away from his view\r\n",
      "of the rain, which he found different somehow from other rain, as\r\n",
      "everything else was different, and replied that he knew well enough what\r\n",
      "she could make Mr. Longdon do, but only wondered at Mr. Longdon's secret\r\n",
      "for acting on their friend. He was there before her with his hands in\r\n",
      "his pockets and appreciation winking from every yellow spot in his red\r\n",
      "necktie. \"Afternoon service of a wet Sunday in a small country town is a\r\n",
      "large order. Does Van do everything the governor wants?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He may perhaps have had a suspicion of what I want,\" Nanda explained.\r\n",
      "\"If I want particularly to talk to you--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has got out of the way to give me a chance? Well then he's as\r\n",
      "usual simply magnificent. How can I express the bliss of finding myself\r\n",
      "enclosed with you in this sweet old security, this really unimagined\r\n",
      "sanctity? Nothing's more charming than suddenly to come across something\r\n",
      "sharp and fresh after we've thought there was nothing more that could\r\n",
      "draw from us a groan. We've supposed we've had it all, have squeezed the\r\n",
      "last impression out of the last disappointment, penetrated to the last\r\n",
      "familiarity in the last surprise; then some fine day we find that we\r\n",
      "haven't done justice to life. There are little things that pop up and\r\n",
      "make us feel again. What MAY happen is after all incalculable. There's\r\n",
      "just a little chuck of the dice, and for three minutes we win. These,\r\n",
      "my dear young lady, are my three minutes. You wouldn't believe the\r\n",
      "amusement I get from them, and how can I possibly tell you? There's a\r\n",
      "faint divine old fragrance here in the room--or doesn't it perhaps reach\r\n",
      "you? I shan't have lived without it, but I see now I had been afraid\r\n",
      "I should. You, on your side, won't have lived without some touch of\r\n",
      "greatness. This moment's great and you've produced it. You were great\r\n",
      "when you felt all you COULD produce. Therefore,\" Mitchy went on, pausing\r\n",
      "once more, as he walked, before a picture, \"I won't pull the whole thing\r\n",
      "down by the vulgarity of wishing I too only had a first-rate Cotman.\"\r\n",

      "\"Have you given up some VERY big thing to come?\" Nanda replied to this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What in the world is very big, my child, but the beauty of this hour?\r\n",
      "I haven't the least idea WHAT, when I got Mr. Longdon's note, I gave\r\n",
      "up. Don't ask me for an account of anything; everything went--became\r\n",
      "imperceptible. I WILL say that for myself: I shed my badness, I do\r\n",
      "forget people, with a facility that makes me, for bits, for little\r\n",
      "patches, so far as they're concerned, cease to BE; so that my life is\r\n",
      "spotted all over with momentary states in which I'm as the dead of whom\r\n",
      "nothing's said but good.\" He had strolled toward her again while she\r\n",
      "smiled at him. \"I've died for this, Nanda.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The only difficulty I see,\" she presently replied, \"is that you ought\r\n",
      "to marry a woman really clever and that I'm not quite sure what there\r\n",
      "may be of that in Aggie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In Aggie?\" her friend echoed very gently. \"Is THAT what you've sent for\r\n",
      "me for--to talk about Aggie?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Didn't it occur to you it might be?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That it couldn't possibly, you mean, be anything else?\" He looked about\r\n",
      "for the place in which it would express the deepest surrender to the\r\n",
      "scene to sit--then sank down with a beautiful prompt submission. \"I've\r\n",
      "no idea of what occurred to me--nothing at least but the sense that I\r\n",
      "had occurred to YOU. The occurrence is clay in the hands of the potter.\r\n",
      "Do with me what you will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You appreciate everything so wonderfully,\" Nanda said, \"that it\r\n",
      "oughtn't to be hard for you to appreciate HER. I do dream so you may\r\n",
      "save her. That's why I haven't waited.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The only thing that remains to me in life,\" he answered, \"is a certain\r\n",
      "accessibility to the thought of what I may still do to figure a little\r\n",
      "in your eye; but that's precisely a thought you may assist to become\r\n",
      "clearer. You may for instance give me some pledge or sign that if I do\r\n",
      "figure--prance and caracole and sufficiently kick up the dust--your\r\n",
      "eye won't suffer itself to be distracted from me. I think there's no\r\n",
      "adventure I'm not ready to undertake for you; yet my passion--chastened,\r\n",
      "through all this, purified, austere--is still enough of this world not\r\n",
      "wholly to have renounced the fancy of some small reward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How small?\" the girl asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She spoke as if feeling she must take from him in common kindness\r\n",
      "at least as much as she would make him take, and the serious anxious\r\n",
      "patience such a consciousness gave her tone was met by Mitchy with\r\n",
      "a charmed reasonableness that his habit of hyperbole did nothing to\r\n",
      "misrepresent. He glowed at her with the fullest recognition that there\r\n",
      "was something he was there to discuss with her, but with the assurance\r\n",
      "in every soft sound of him that no height to which she might lift the\r\n",
      "discussion would be too great for him to reach. His every cadence\r\n",
      "and every motion was an implication, as from one to the other, of the\r\n",
      "exquisite. Oh he could sustain it! \"Well, I mean the establishment of\r\n",
      "something between us. I mean your arranging somehow that we shall be\r\n",
      "drawn more together--know together something nobody else knows. I should\r\n",
      "like so terrifically to have a RELATION that is a secret, with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh if that's all you want you can be easily gratified. Rien de plus\r\n",
      "facile, as mamma says. I'm full of secrets--I think I'm really most\r\n",
      "secretive. I'll share almost any one of them with you--if it's only a\r\n",
      "good one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy debated. \"You mean you'll choose it yourself? You won't let it be\r\n",
      "one of mine?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda wondered. \"But what's the difference?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion jumped up again and for a moment pervaded the place. \"When\r\n",
      "you say such things as that, you're of a beauty--! MAY it,\" he asked as\r\n",
      "he stopped before her, \"be one of mine--a perfectly awful one?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She showed her clearest interest. \"As I suppose the most awful secrets\r\n",
      "are the best--yes, certainly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm hideously tempted.\" But he hung fire; then dropping into his chair\r\n",
      "again: \"It would be too bad. I'm afraid I can't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why won't THIS do, just as it is?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'This'?\" He looked over the big bland room. \"Which?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why what you're here for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child I'm here--most of all--to love you more than ever; and\r\n",
      "there's an absence of favouring mystery about THAT--!\" She looked at\r\n",
      "him as if seeing what he meant and only asking to remedy it. \"There's a\r\n",
      "certain amount of mystery we can now MAKE--that it strikes me in fact we\r\n",
      "MUST make. Dear Mitchy,\" she continued almost with eagerness, \"I don't\r\n",
      "think we CAN really tell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had fallen back in his chair, not looking at her now, and with his\r\n",
      "hands, from his supported elbows, clasped to keep himself more quiet.\r\n",
      "\"Are you still talking about Aggie?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why I've scarcely begun!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" It was not irritation he appeared to express, but the slight\r\n",
      "strain of an effort to get into relation with the subject. Better to\r\n",
      "focus the image he closed his eyes a while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You speak of something that may draw us together, and I simply reply\r\n",
      "that if you don't feel how near together we are--in this I shouldn't\r\n",
      "imagine you ever would. You must have wonderful notions,\" she presently\r\n",
      "went on, \"of the ideal state of union. I pack every one off for you--I\r\n",
      "banish everything that can interfere, and I don't in the least mind your\r\n",
      "knowing that I find the consequence delightful. YOU may talk, if you\r\n",
      "like, of what will have passed between us, but I shall never mention\r\n",
      "it to a soul; literally not to a living creature. What do you want more\r\n",
      "than that?\" He opened his eyes in deference to the question, but replied\r\n",
      "only with a gaze as unassisted as if it had come through a hole in\r\n",
      "a curtain. \"You say you're ready for an adventure, and it's just an\r\n",
      "adventure that I propose. If I can make you feel for yourself as I feel\r\n",
      "for you the beauty of your chance to go in and save her--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if you can--?\" Mitchy at last broke in. \"I don't think, you\r\n",
      "know,\" he said after a moment, \"you'll find it easy to make your two\r\n",
      "ends meet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought a little longer. \"One of the ends is yours, so that you'll\r\n",
      "act WITH me. If I wind you up so that you go--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll just happily sit and watch me spin? Thank you! THAT will be my\r\n",
      "reward?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda rose on this from her chair as with the impulse of protest.\r\n",
      "\"Shan't you care for my gratitude, my admiration?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes\"--Mitchy seemed to muse. \"I shall care for THEM. Yet I don't\r\n",
      "quite see, you know, what you OWE to Aggie. It isn't as if--!\" But with\r\n",
      "this he faltered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As if she cared particularly for ME? Ah that has nothing to do with\r\n",
      "it; that's a thing without which surely it's but too possible to be\r\n",
      "exquisite. There are beautiful, quite beautiful people who don't care\r\n",
      "for me. The thing that's important to one is the thing one sees one's\r\n",
      "self, and it's quite enough if _I_ see what can be made of that child.\r\n",
      "Marry her, Mitchy, and you'll see who she'll care for!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy kept his position; he was for the moment--his image of shortly\r\n",
      "before reversed--the one who appeared to sit happily and watch. \"It's\r\n",
      "too awfully pleasant your asking of me anything whatever!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, as I say, beautifully, grandly save her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As you say, yes\"--he sympathetically inclined his head. \"But without\r\n",
      "making me feel exactly what you mean by it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Keep her,\" Nanda returned, \"from becoming like the Duchess.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But she isn't a bit like the Duchess in any of her elements. She's a\r\n",
      "totally different thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was only for an instant, however, that this objection seemed to\r\n",
      "tell. \"That's exactly why she'll be so perfect for you. You'll get her\r\n",
      "away--take her out of her aunt's life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy met it all now in a sort of spellbound stillness. \"What do you\r\n",
      "know about her aunt's life?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know everything!\" She spoke with her first faint shade of\r\n",
      "impatience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It produced for a little a hush between them, at the end of which her\r\n",
      "companion said with extraordinary gentleness and tenderness: \"Dear\r\n",
      "old Nanda!\" Her own silence appeared consciously to continue, and the\r\n",
      "suggestion of it might have been that for intelligent ears there was\r\n",
      "nothing to add to the declaration she had just made and which Mitchy\r\n",
      "sat there taking in as with a new light. What he drew from it indeed\r\n",
      "he presently went on to show. \"You're too awfully interesting. Of\r\n",
      "course--you know a lot. How shouldn't you--and why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Why'? Oh that's another affair! But you don't imagine what I know; I'm\r\n",
      "sure it's much more than you've a notion of. That's the kind of thing\r\n",
      "now one IS--just except the little marvel of Aggie. What on earth,\" the\r\n",
      "girl pursued, \"do you take us for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it's all right!\" breathed Mitchy, divinely pacific.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I don't know whether it is; I shouldn't wonder if it were in\r\n",
      "fact all wrong. But what at least is certainly right is for one not to\r\n",
      "pretend anything else. There I am for you at any rate. Now the beauty of\r\n",
      "Aggie is that she knows nothing--but absolutely, utterly: not the least\r\n",
      "little tittle of anything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was barely visible that Mitchy hesitated, and he spoke quite gravely.\r\n",
      "\"Have you tried her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes. And Tishy has.\" His gravity had been less than Nanda's.\r\n",
      "\"Nothing, nothing.\" The memory of some scene or some passage might have\r\n",
      "come back to her with a charm. \"Ah say what you will--it IS the way we\r\n",
      "ought to be!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, after a minute of much intensity, had stopped watching her;\r\n",
      "changing his posture and with his elbows on his knees he dropped for\r\n",
      "a while his face into his hands. Then he jerked himself to his feet.\r\n",
      "\"There's something I wish awfully I could say to you. But I can't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda, after a slow headshake, covered him with one of the dimmest of\r\n",
      "her smiles. \"You needn't say it. I know perfectly which it is.\" She held\r\n",
      "him an instant, after which she went on: \"It's simply that you wish me\r\n",
      "fully to understand that you're one who, in perfect sincerity, doesn't\r\n",
      "mind one straw how awful--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, how awful?\" He had kindled, as he paused, with his new eagerness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, one's knowledge may be. It doesn't shock in you a single\r\n",
      "hereditary prejudice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh 'hereditary'--!\" Mitchy ecstatically murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You even rather like me the better for it; so that one of the reasons\r\n",
      "why you couldn't have told me--though not of course, I know, the only\r\n",
      "one--is that you would have been literally almost ashamed. Because, you\r\n",
      "know,\" she went on, \"it IS strange.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My lack of hereditary--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, discomfort in presence of the fact I speak of. There's a kind of\r\n",
      "sense you don't possess.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His appreciation again fairly goggled at her. \"Oh you do know\r\n",
      "everything!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're so good that nothing shocks you,\" she lucidly persisted.\r\n",
      "\"There's a kind of delicacy you haven't got.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was more and more struck. \"I've only that--as it were--of the skin\r\n",
      "and the fingers?\" he appealed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh and that of the mind. And that of the soul. And some other kinds\r\n",
      "certainly. But not THE kind.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes\"--he wondered--\"I suppose that's the only way one can name it.\" It\r\n",
      "appeared to rise there before him. \"THE kind!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The kind that would make me painful to you. Or rather not me perhaps,\"\r\n",
      "she added as if to create between them the fullest possible light; \"but\r\n",
      "my situation, my exposure--all the results of them I show. Doesn't one\r\n",
      "become a sort of a little drain-pipe with everything flowing through?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why don't you call it more gracefully,\" Mitchy asked, freshly struck,\r\n",
      "\"a little aeolian-harp set in the drawing-room window and vibrating in\r\n",
      "the breeze of conversation?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh because the harp gives out a sound, and WE--at least we try to--give\r\n",
      "out none.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What you take, you mean, you keep?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it sticks to us. And that's what you don't mind!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their eyes met long on it. \"Yes--I see. I DON'T mind. I've the most\r\n",
      "extraordinary lacunae.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't know about others,\" Nanda replied; \"I haven't noticed them.\r\n",
      "But you've that one, and it's enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He continued to face her with his queer mixture of assent and\r\n",
      "speculation. \"Enough for what, my dear? To have made me impossible for\r\n",
      "you because the only man you could, as they say, have 'respected' would\r\n",
      "be a man who WOULD have minded?\" Then as under the cool soft pressure of\r\n",
      "the question she looked at last away from him: \"The man with 'THE kind,'\r\n",
      "as you call it, happens to be just the type you CAN love? But what's the\r\n",
      "use,\" he persisted as she answered nothing, \"in loving a person with the\r\n",
      "prejudice--hereditary or other--to which you're precisely obnoxious? Do\r\n",
      "you positively LIKE to love in vain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a question, the way she turned back to him seemed to say, that\r\n",
      "deserved a responsible answer. \"Yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she had moved off after speaking, and Mitchy's eyes followed her to\r\n",
      "different parts of the room as, with small pretexts of present attention\r\n",
      "to it, small bestowed touches for symmetry, she slowly measured it.\r\n",
      "\"What's extraordinary then is your idea of my finding any charm in\r\n",
      "Aggie's ignorance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She immediately put down an old snuff-box. \"Why--it's the one sort of\r\n",
      "thing you don't know. You can't imagine,\" she said as she returned to\r\n",

      "Nanda's gravity was wonderful--\"better than anything you HAVE known.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clear sincerity of this, even had there been nothing else, imposed\r\n",
      "a consideration that Mitchy now flagrantly could give, and the deference\r\n",
      "of his suggestion of difficulty only grew more deep. \"I'm to do then,\r\n",
      "with this happy condition of hers, what you say YOU'VE done--to 'try'\r\n",
      "it?\" And then as her assent, so directly challenged, failed an instant:\r\n",
      "\"But won't my approach to it, however cautious, be just what will break\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Without,\" Nanda pursued, \"being as good.\" She had on this, in a\r\n",
      "different key, her own sudden explosion. \"Don't you see, Mitchy\r\n",
      "dear--for the very heart of it all--how good I BELIEVE you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had spoken as with a flare of impatience at some justice he failed\r\n",
      "to do her, and this brought him after a startled instant close enough\r\n",
      "to her to take up her hand. She let him have it, and in mute solemn\r\n",
      "reassurance he raised it to his lips, saying to her thus more things\r\n",
      "than he could say in any other way; which yet just after, when he had\r\n",
      "released it and a motionless pause had ensued, didn't prevent his adding\r\n",
      "three words. \"Oh Nanda, Nanda!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tone of them made her again extraordinarily gentle. \"Don't 'try'\r\n",
      "anything then. Take everything for granted.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had turned away from her and walked mechanically, with his air of\r\n",
      "blind emotion, to the window, where for a minute he looked out. \"It has\r\n",
      "stopped raining,\" he said at last; \"it's going to brighten.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The place had three windows, and Nanda went to the next. \"Not quite\r\n",

      "moved, as quietly, almost as cautiously, as if on tiptoe, to the seat\r\n",
      "occupied by his companion at the beginning of their talk. Here he sank\r\n",
      "down watching the girl, who stood a while longer with her eyes on the\r\n",
      "garden. \"You want me, you say, to take her out of the Duchess's\r\n",
      "life; but where am I myself, if we come to that, but even more IN the\r\n",
      "Duchess's life than Aggie is? I'm in it by my contacts, my associations,\r\n",
      "my indifferences--all my acceptances, knowledges, amusements. I'm in it\r\n",
      "by my cynicisms--those that circumstances somehow from the first, when\r\n",
      "I began for myself to look at life and the world, committed me to and\r\n",
      "steeped me in; I'm in it by a kind of desperation that I shouldn't have\r\n",

      "which you've got hold of me to-day; and I'm in it more than all--you'll\r\n",
      "yourself admit--by the very fact that her aunt desires, as you know,\r\n",
      "much more even than you do, to bring the thing about. Then we SHOULD\r\n",
      "be--the Duchess and I--shoulder to shoulder!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda heard him motionless to the end, taking also another minute to\r\n",
      "turn over what he had said. \"What is it you like so in Lord Petherton?\"\r\n",
      "she asked as she came to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child, if you only could tell me! It would be, wouldn't it?--it\r\n",
      "must have been--the subject of some fairy-tale, if fairy-tales were made\r\n",
      "now, or better still of some Christmas pantomime: 'The Gnome and the\r\n",
      "Giant.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda appeared to try--not with much success--to see it. \"Do you find\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "His hands in his pockets and his legs much apart, Mitchy sat there as in\r\n",
      "a posture adapted to her simplicity. \"You're adorable. YOU don't. But it\r\n",
      "IS rather horrid, isn't it?\" he presently went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her momentary silence would have been by itself enough of an answer.\r\n",
      "\"Nothing--of all you speak of,\" she nevertheless returned, \"will matter\r\n",
      "then. She'll so simplify your life.\" He remained just as he was, only\r\n",
      "with his eyes on her; and meanwhile she had turned again to her window,\r\n",
      "through which a faint sun-streak began to glimmer and play. At sight of\r\n",
      "it she opened the casement to let in the warm freshness. \"The rain HAS\r\n",
      "stopped.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You say you want me to save her. But what you really mean,\" Mitchy\r\n",
      "resumed from the sofa, \"isn't at all exactly that.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her friend got up, found his wonderful crossbarred cap, after a glance,\r\n",
      "on a neighbouring chair, and with it came toward her. \"Your hope is\r\n",
      "that--as I'm good enough to be worth it--she'll save ME.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda looked at him now. \"She will, Mitchy--she WILL!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They stood a moment in the recovered brightness; after which he\r\n",
      "mechanically--as with the pressure of quite another consciousness--put\r\n",
      "on his cap. \"Well then, shall that hope between us be the thing--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The thing?\"--she just wondered.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It had been understood that he was to take his leave on the morrow,\r\n",
      "though Vanderbank was to stay another day. Mr. Longdon had for the\r\n",
      "Sunday dinner invited three or four of his neighbours to \"meet\" the two\r\n",
      "gentlemen from town, so that it was not till the company had departed,\r\n",
      "or in other words till near bedtime, that our four friends could again\r\n",
      "have become aware, as between themselves, of that directness of mutual\r\n",
      "relation which forms the subject of our picture. It had not, however,\r\n",
      "prevented Nanda's slipping upstairs as soon as the doctor and his wife\r\n",
      "had gone, and the manner indeed in which, on the stroke of eleven, Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon conformed to his tradition of appropriating a particular candle\r\n",
      "was as positive an expression of it as any other. Nothing in him\r\n",
      "was more amiable than the terms maintained between the rigour of his\r\n",
      "personal habits and his free imagination of the habits of others. He\r\n",
      "deprecated as regards the former, it might have been seen, most signs of\r\n",
      "likeness, and no one had ever dared to learn how he would have handled\r\n",
      "a show of imitation. \"The way to flatter him,\" Mitchy threw off five\r\n",
      "minutes later, \"is not to make him think you resemble or agree with him,\r\n",
      "but to let him see how different you perceive he can bear to think you.\r\n",
      "I mean of course without hating you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what interest have YOU,\" Vanderbank asked, \"in the way to flatter\r\n",
      "him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear fellow, more interest than you. I haven't been here all day\r\n",
      "without arriving at conclusions on the credit he has opened to you--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean the amount he'll settle?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have it in your power,\" said Mitchy, \"to make it anything you\r\n",
      "like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And is he then--so bloated?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy was on his feet in the apartment in which their host had left\r\n",
      "them, and he had at first for this question but an expressive motion of\r\n",
      "the shoulders in respect to everything in the room. \"See, judge, guess,\r\n",
      "feel!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was as if Vanderbank, before the fire, consciously controlled his\r\n",
      "own attention. \"Oh I don't care a hang!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This passage took place in the library and as a consequence of their\r\n",
      "having confessed, as their friend faced them with his bedroom light,\r\n",
      "that a brief discreet vigil and a box of cigars would fix better than\r\n",
      "anything else the fine impression of the day. Mitchy might at that\r\n",
      "moment, on the evidence of the eyes Mr. Longdon turned to them and of\r\n",
      "which his innocent candle-flame betrayed the secret, have found matter\r\n",
      "for a measure of the almost extreme allowances he wanted them to want of\r\n",
      "him. They had only to see that the greater window was fast and to turn\r\n",
      "out the library lamp. It might really have amused them to stand a moment\r\n",
      "at the open door that, apart from this, was to testify to his conception\r\n",
      "of those who were not, in the smaller hours, as HE was. He had in fact\r\n",
      "by his retreat--and but too sensibly--left them there with a deal of\r\n",
      "midnight company. If one of these presences was the mystery he had\r\n",
      "himself mixed the manner of our young men showed a due expectation of\r\n",
      "the others. Mitchy, on hearing how little Vanderbank \"cared,\" only kept\r\n",
      "up a while longer that observant revolution in which he had spent much\r\n",
      "of his day, to which any fresh sense of any exhibition always promptly\r\n",
      "committed him, and which, had it not been controlled by infinite tact,\r\n",
      "might have affected the nerves of those in whom enjoyment was less\r\n",
      "rotary. He was silent long enough to suggest his fearing that almost\r\n",
      "anything he might say would appear too allusive; then at last once more\r\n",
      "he took his risk. \"Awfully jolly old place!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is indeed,\" Van only said; but his posture in the large chair he\r\n",
      "had pushed toward the open window was of itself almost an opinion.\r\n",
      "The August night was hot and the air that came in charged and sweet.\r\n",
      "Vanderbank smoked with his face to the dusky garden and the dim stars;\r\n",
      "at the end of a few moments more of which he glanced round. \"Don't\r\n",
      "you think it rather stuffy with that big lamp? As those candles on the\r\n",
      "chimney are going we might put it out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like this?\" The amiable Mitchy had straightway obliged his companion\r\n",
      "and he as promptly took in the effect of the diminished light on the\r\n",
      "character of the room, which he commended as if the depth of shadow\r\n",
      "produced were all this companion had sought. He might freshly have\r\n",
      "brought home to Vanderbank that a man sensitive to so many different\r\n",
      "things, and thereby always sure of something or other, could never\r\n",
      "really be incommoded; though that personage presently indeed showed\r\n",
      "himself occupied with another thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think I ought to mention to you that I've told him how you and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook now both know. I did so this afternoon on our way back from\r\n",
      "church--I hadn't done it before. He took me a walk round to show me\r\n",
      "more of the place, and that gave me my chance. But he doesn't mind,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank continued. \"The only thing is that I've thought it may\r\n",
      "possibly make him speak to you, so that it's better you should know he\r\n",
      "knows. But he told me definitely Nanda doesn't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy took this in with an attention that spoke of his already\r\n",
      "recognising how the less tempered darkness favoured talk. \"And is that\r\n",
      "all that passed between you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, practically; except of course that I made him understand, I\r\n",
      "think, how it happened that I haven't kept my own counsel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but you HAVE--didn't he at least feel?--or perhaps even have done\r\n",
      "better, when you've two such excellent persons to keep it FOR you. Can't\r\n",
      "he easily believe how we feel with you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank appeared for a minute to leave this appeal unheeded; he\r\n",
      "continued to stare into the garden while he smoked and swung the long\r\n",
      "leg he had thrown over the arm of the chair. When he at last spoke,\r\n",
      "however, it was with some emphasis--perhaps even with some vulgarity.\r\n",
      "\"Oh rot!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy hovered without an arrest. \"You mean he CAN'T feel?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean it isn't true. I've no illusions about you. I know how you're\r\n",
      "both affected, though I of course perfectly trust you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy had a short silence. \"Trust us not to speak?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not to speak to Nanda herself--though of course too if you spoke to\r\n",
      "others,\" Vanderbank went on, \"they'd immediately rush and tell her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've spoken to no one,\" said Mitchy. \"I'm sure of it. And neither has\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm glad you're sure of that also,\" Mitchy returned, \"for it's only\r\n",
      "doing her justice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'm quite confident of it,\" said Vanderbank. \"And without asking\r\n",
      "her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perfectly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you're equally sure, without asking, that _I_ haven't betrayed\r\n",
      "you?\" After which, while, as if to let the question lie there in its\r\n",
      "folly, Vanderbank said nothing, his friend pursued: \"I came, I must tell\r\n",
      "you, terribly near it to-day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why must you tell me? Your coming 'near' doesn't concern me, and I take\r\n",
      "it you don't suppose I'm watching or sounding you. Mrs. Brook will have\r\n",
      "come terribly near,\" Vanderbank continued as if to make the matter\r\n",
      "free; \"but she won't have done it either. She'll have been distinctly\r\n",
      "tempted--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But she won't have fallen?\" Mitchy broke in. \"Exactly--there we are.\r\n",
      "_I_ was distinctly tempted and I didn't fall. I think your certainty\r\n",
      "about Mrs. Brook,\" he added, \"shows you do know her. She's incapable of\r\n",
      "anything deliberately nasty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh of anything nasty in any way,\" Vanderbank said musingly and kindly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; one knows on the whole what she WON'T do.\" After which, for a\r\n",
      "period, Mitchy roamed and reflected. \"But in spite of the assurance\r\n",
      "given you by Mr. Longdon--or perhaps indeed just because of your having\r\n",
      "taken it--I think I ought to mention to you my belief that Nanda does\r\n",
      "know of his offer to you. I mean by having guessed it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Vanderbank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's in fact more still,\" his companion pursued--\"that I feel I\r\n",
      "should like to mention to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" Vanderbank at first only repeated. But after a moment he said: \"My\r\n",
      "dear fellow, I'm much obliged.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The thing I speak of is something I should at any rate have said, and\r\n",
      "I should have looked out for some chance if we had not had this one.\"\r\n",
      "Mitchy spoke as if his friend's last words were not of consequence, and\r\n",
      "he continued as Vanderbank got up and, moving rather aimlessly, came and\r\n",
      "stood with his back to the chimney. \"My only hesitation would have been\r\n",
      "caused by its entailing our going down into things in a way that, face\r\n",
      "to face--given the private nature of the things--I dare say most men\r\n",
      "don't particularly enjoy. But if you don't mind--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't mind. In fact, as I tell you, I recognise an obligation to\r\n",
      "you.\" Vanderbank, with his shoulders against the high mantel, uttered\r\n",
      "this without a direct look; he smoked and smoked, then considered the\r\n",
      "tip of his cigar. \"You feel convinced she knows?\" he threw out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it's my impression.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah any impression of yours--of that sort--is sure to be right. If you\r\n",
      "think I ought to have it from you I'm really grateful. Is that--a--what\r\n",
      "you wanted to say to me?\" Vanderbank after a slight pause demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, watching him more than he watched Mitchy, shook a mildly\r\n",
      "decisive head. \"No.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, his eyes on his smoke-puffs, seemed to wonder. \"What you\r\n",
      "wanted is--something else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Something else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Vanderbank for the third time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ejaculation had been vague, but the movement that followed it was\r\n",
      "definite; the young man, turning away, found himself again near the\r\n",
      "chair he had quitted, and resumed possession of it as a sign of being\r\n",
      "at his friend's service. This friend, however, not only hung fire but\r\n",
      "finally went back to take a shot from a quarter they might have been\r\n",
      "supposed to have left. \"It strikes me as odd his imagining--awfully\r\n",
      "acute as he is--that she has NOT guessed. One wouldn't have thought he\r\n",
      "could live with her here in such an intimacy--seeing her every day and\r\n",
      "pretty much all day--and make such a mistake.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, his great length all of a lounge again, turned it over. \"And\r\n",
      "yet I do thoroughly feel the mistake's not yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy had a new serenity of affirmation. \"Oh it's not mine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps then\"--it occurred to his friend--\"he doesn't really believe\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And only says so to make you feel more easy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So that one may--in fairness to one's self--keep one's head, as it\r\n",
      "were, and decide quite on one's own grounds.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you HAVE still to decide?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank took time to answer. \"I've still to decide.\" Mitchy became\r\n",
      "again on this, in the sociable dusk, a slow-circling vaguely-agitated\r\n",
      "element, and his companion continued: \"Is your idea very generously and\r\n",
      "handsomely to help that by letting me know--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I do definitely renounce\"--Mitchy took him up--\"any pretension and\r\n",
      "any hope? Well, I'm ready with a proof of it. I've passed my word that\r\n",
      "I'll apply elsewhere.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank turned more round to him. \"Apply to the Duchess for her\r\n",

      "\"But since when?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy barely faltered. \"Since this afternoon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah then not with the Duchess herself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With Nanda--whose plan from the first, you won't have forgotten, the\r\n",
      "thing has so charmingly been.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank could show that his not having in the least forgotten was yet\r\n",
      "not a bar to his being now mystified. \"But, my dear man, what can Nanda\r\n",
      "'settle'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My fate,\" Mitchy said, pausing well before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank sat now a minute with raised eyes, catching the\r\n",
      "indistinctness of the other's strange expression. \"You're both beyond\r\n",
      "me!\" he exclaimed at last. \"I don't see what you in particular gain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I didn't either till she made it all out to me. One sees then, in such\r\n",
      "a matter, for one's self. And as everything's gain that isn't loss,\r\n",
      "there was nothing I COULD lose. It gets me,\" Mitchy further explained,\r\n",
      "\"out of the way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Out of the way of what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This, Mitchy frankly showed, was more difficult to say, but he in time\r\n",
      "brought it out. \"Well, of appearing to suggest to you that my existence,\r\n",
      "in a prolonged state of singleness, may ever represent for her any real\r\n",
      "alternative.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But alternative to what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why to being YOUR wife, damn you!\" Mitchy, on these words turned away\r\n",
      "again, and his companion, in the presence of his renewed dim gyrations,\r\n",
      "sat for a minute dumb. Before Van had spoken indeed he was back again.\r\n",
      "\"Excuse my violence, but of course you really see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not pretending anything,\" Vanderbank said--\"but a man MUST\r\n",
      "understand. What I catch hold of is that you offer me--in the fact that\r\n",
      "you're thus at any rate disposed of--a proof that I, by the same token,\r\n",
      "shan't, if I hesitate to 'go in,' have a pretext for saying to myself\r\n",
      "that I MAY deprive her--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, precisely,\" Mitchy now urbanely assented: \"of something--in the\r\n",
      "shape of a man with MY amount of money--that she may live to regret\r\n",
      "and to languish for. My amount of money, don't you see?\" he very simply\r\n",
      "added, \"is nothing to her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you want me to be sure that--so far as I may ever have had a\r\n",
      "scruple--she has had her chance and got rid of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Completely,\" Mitchy smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because\"--Vanderbank with the aid of his cigar thoughtfully pieced it\r\n",
      "out--\"that may possibly bring me to the point.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Possibly!\" Mitchy laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had stood a moment longer, almost as if to see the possibility\r\n",
      "develop before his eyes, and had even started at the next sound of his\r\n",
      "friend's voice. What Vanderbank in fact brought out, however, only made\r\n",
      "him turn his back. \"Do you like so very much little Aggie?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mitchy, \"Nanda does. And I like Nanda.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're too amazing,\" Vanderbank mused. His musing had presently the\r\n",
      "effect of making him rise; meditation indeed beset him after he was\r\n",
      "on his feet. \"I can't help its coming over me then that on such an\r\n",
      "extraordinary system you must also rather like ME.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What will you have, my dear Van?\" Mitchy frankly asked. \"It's the\r\n",
      "sort of thing you must be most used to. For at the present\r\n",
      "moment--look!--aren't we all at you at once?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was as if his dear Van had managed to appear to wonder. \"'All'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nanda, Mrs. Brook, Mr. Longdon--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you. I see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Names of distinction. And all the others,\" Mitchy pursued, \"that I\r\n",
      "don't count.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you're the best.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're the best,\" Vanderbank simply repeated. \"It's at all events most\r\n",
      "extraordinary,\" he declared. \"But I make you out on the whole better\r\n",
      "than I do Mr. Longdon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah aren't we very much the same--simple lovers of life? That is of that\r\n",
      "finer essence of it which appeals to the consciousness--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The consciousness?\"--his companion took up his hesitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, enlarged and improved.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The words had made on Mitchy's lips an image by which his friend\r\n",
      "appeared for a moment held. \"One doesn't really know quite what to say\r\n",
      "or to do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you must take it all quietly. You're of a special class; one of\r\n",
      "those who, as we said the other day--don't you remember?--are a\r\n",
      "source of the sacred terror. People made in such a way must take the\r\n",
      "consequences; just as people must take them,\" Mitchy went on, \"who are\r\n",
      "made as _I_ am. So cheer up!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, uttering this incitement, had moved to the empty chair by\r\n",
      "the window, in which he presently was sunk; and it might have been in\r\n",
      "emulation of his previous strolling and straying that Vanderbank himself\r\n",
      "now began to revolve. The meditation he next threw out, however, showed\r\n",
      "a certain resistance to Mitchy's advice. \"I'm glad at any rate I don't\r\n",
      "deprive her of a fortune.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't deprive her of mine of course,\" Mitchy answered from the\r\n",
      "chair; \"but isn't her enjoyment of Mr. Longdon's at least a good deal\r\n",
      "staked after all on your action?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank stopped short. \"It's his idea to settle it ALL?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy gave out his glare. \"I thought you didn't 'care a hang.' I\r\n",
      "haven't been here so long,\" he went on as his companion at first\r\n",
      "retorted nothing, \"without making up my mind for myself about his means.\r\n",
      "He IS distinctly bloated.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It sent Vanderbank off again. \"Oh well, she'll no more get all in the\r\n",
      "one event than she'll get nothing in the other. She'll only get a sort\r\n",
      "of provision. But she'll get that whatever happens.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh if you're sure--!\" Mitchy simply commented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not sure, confound it!\" Then--for his voice had been irritated--Van\r\n",
      "spoke more quietly. \"Only I see her here--though on his wish of\r\n",
      "course--handling things quite as if they were her own and paying him a\r\n",
      "visit without, apparently, any calculable end. What's that on HIS part\r\n",
      "but a pledge?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh Mitchy could show off-hand that he knew what it was. \"It's a pledge,\r\n",
      "quite as much, to you. He shows you the whole thing. He likes you not a\r\n",
      "whit less than he likes her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh thunder!\" Van impatiently sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's as 'rum' as you please, but there it is,\" said the inexorable\r\n",
      "Mitchy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then does he think I'll do it for THIS?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For 'this'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For the place, the whole thing, as you call it, that he shows me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy had a short silence that might have represented a change of\r\n",
      "colour. \"It isn't good enough?\" But he instantly took himself up. \"Of\r\n",
      "course he wants--as I do--to treat you with tact!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it's all right,\" Vanderbank immediately said. \"Your 'tact'--yours\r\n",
      "and his--is marvellous, and Nanda's greatest of all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy's momentary renewal of stillness was addressed, he somehow\r\n",
      "managed not obscurely to convey, to the last clause of his friend's\r\n",
      "speech. \"If you're not sure,\" he presently resumed, \"why can't you\r\n",
      "frankly ask him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank again, as the phrase is, \"mooned\" about a little. \"Because I\r\n",
      "don't know that it would do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean by 'do'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that it would be exactly--what do you call it?--'square.' Or even\r\n",
      "quite delicate or decent. To take from him, in the way of an assurance\r\n",
      "so handsomely offered, so much, and then to ask for more: I don't feel I\r\n",
      "can do it. Besides, I've my little conviction. To the question itself he\r\n",
      "might easily reply that it's none of my business.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see,\" Mitchy dropped. \"Such pressure might suggest to him moreover\r\n",
      "that you're hesitating more than you perhaps really are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh as to THAT\" said Vanderbank, \"I think he practically knows how\r\n",
      "much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And how little?\" He met this, however, with no more form than if it had\r\n",
      "been a poor joke, so that Mitchy also smoked for a moment in silence.\r\n",
      "\"It's your coming down here, you mean, for these three or four days,\r\n",
      "that will have fixed it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question this time was one to which the speaker might have expected\r\n",
      "an answer, but Vanderbank's only immediate answer was to walk and walk.\r\n",
      "\"I want so awfully to be kind to her,\" he at last said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should think so!\" Then with irrelevance Mitchy harked back. \"Shall\r\n",
      "_I_ find out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Vanderbank, with another thought, had lost the thread. \"Find out\r\n",
      "what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why if she does get anything--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I'm not kind ENOUGH?\"--Van had caught up again. \"Dear no; I'd rather\r\n",
      "you shouldn't speak unless first spoken to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, HE may speak--since he knows we know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It isn't likely, for he can't make out why I told you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You didn't tell ME, you know,\" said Mitchy. \"You told Mrs. Brook.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, SHE told you, and her talking about it is the unpleasant idea. He\r\n",
      "can't get her down anyhow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Poor Mrs. Brook!\" Mitchy meditated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Poor Mrs. Brook!\" his companion echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I thought you said,\" he went on, \"that he doesn't mind.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"YOUR knowing? Well, I dare say he doesn't. But he doesn't want a lot of\r\n",
      "gossip and chatter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Mitchy with meekness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I may absolutely take it from you then,\" Vanderbank presently resumed,\r\n",
      "\"that Nanda has her idea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh she didn't tell me so. But it's none the less my belief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Vanderbank at last threw off, \"I feel it for myself. If only\r\n",
      "because she always knows everything,\" he pursued without looking at\r\n",
      "Mitchy. \"She always knows everything, everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everything, everything.\" Mitchy got up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She told me so herself yesterday,\" said Van.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And she told ME so to-day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's hesitation might have shown he was struck with this. \"Well,\r\n",
      "I don't think it's information that either of us required. But of course\r\n",
      "she--can't help it,\" he added. \"Everything, literally everything, in\r\n",
      "London, in the world she lives in, is in the air she breathes--so that\r\n",
      "the longer SHE'S in it the more she'll know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The more she'll know, certainly,\" Mitchy acknowledged. \"But she isn't\r\n",
      "in it, you see, down here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. Only she appears to have come down with such accumulations. And she\r\n",
      "won't be here for ever,\" Vanderbank hastened to mention. \"Certainly not\r\n",
      "if you marry her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But isn't that at the same time,\" Vanderbank asked, \"just the\r\n",
      "difficulty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy looked vague. \"The difficulty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why as a married woman she'll be steeped in it again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Surely\"--oh Mitchy could be candid! \"But the difference will be that\r\n",
      "for a married woman it won't matter. It only matters for girls,\" he\r\n",
      "plausibly continued--\"and then only for those on whom no one takes\r\n",
      "pity.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The trouble is,\" said Vanderbank--but quite as if uttering only a\r\n",
      "general truth--\"that it's just a thing that may sometimes operate as\r\n",
      "a bar to pity. Isn't it for the non-marrying girls that it doesn't\r\n",
      "particularly matter? For the others it's such an odd preparation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't mind it!\" Mitchy declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank visibly demurred. \"Ah but your choice--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is such a different sort of thing?\" Mitchy, for the half-hour, in the\r\n",
      "ambiguous dusk, had never looked more droll. \"The young lady I named\r\n",
      "isn't my CHOICE.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, that's only a sign the more that you do these things more\r\n",
      "easily.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh 'easily'!\" Mitchy murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We oughtn't at any rate to keep it up,\" said Vanderbank, who had looked\r\n",
      "at his watch. \"Twelve twenty-five--good-night. Shall I blow out the\r\n",
      "candles?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do, please. I'll close the window\"--and Mitchy went to it. \"I'll follow\r\n",
      "you--good-night.\" The candles after a minute were out and his friend\r\n",
      "had gone, but Mitchy, left in darkness face to face with the vague quiet\r\n",

      "through a suffusion of pink electricity which melted, at the end of\r\n",

      "empty and which had its little globes of white fire--discreetly limited\r\n",
      "in number--coated with lemon-coloured silk. The walls, covered with\r\n",
      "delicate French mouldings, were so fair that they seemed vaguely\r\n",
      "silvered; the low French chimney had a French fire. There was a\r\n",
      "lemon-coloured stuff on the sofa and chairs, a wonderful polish on the\r\n",
      "floor that was largely exposed, and a copy of a French novel in blue\r\n",
      "paper on one of the spindle-legged tables. Vanderbank looked about him\r\n",
      "an instant as if generally struck, then gave himself to something that\r\n",

      "rather large on the cover of the French book and endowed, after he\r\n",

      "satisfaction, before letting the matter pass, a low confused sound;\r\n",
      "after which, flinging the book down with some emphasis in another place,\r\n",
      "he moved to the chimney-piece, where his eyes for a little intently\r\n",
      "fixed the small ashy wood-fire. When he raised them again it was, on the\r\n",
      "observation that the beautiful clock on the mantel was wrong, to consult\r\n",
      "once more his watch and then give a glance, in the chimney-glass, at the\r\n",
      "state of his moustache, the ends of which he twisted for a moment\r\n",
      "with due care. While so engaged he became aware of something else and,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "room, which contained only themselves, and she had mentioned that she\r\n",

      "\"Awfully kind of him when I've been such a brute.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How--a brute?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I mean not writing--nor going back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I see,\" Nanda simply returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a simplicity that, clearly enough, made her friend a little\r\n",
      "awkward. \"Has he--a--minded? Hut he can't have complained!\" he quickly\r\n",
      "added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh he never complains.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no--it isn't in him. But it's just that,\" said Vanderbank, \"that\r\n",
      "makes one feel so base. I've been ferociously busy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He knows that--he likes it,\" Nanda returned. \"He delights in your work.\r\n",
      "And I've done what I can for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said her companion, \"you've evidently brought him round. I mean to\r\n",
      "this lady.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Tishy? Oh of course I can't leave her--with nobody.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No\"--Vanderbank became jocose again--\"that's a London necessity. You\r\n",
      "can't leave anybody with nobody--exposed to everybody.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mild as it was, however, Nanda missed the pleasantry. \"Mr. Grendon's not\r\n",
      "here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where is he then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yachting--but she doesn't know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then she and you are just doing this together?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Nanda, \"she's dreadfully frightened.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh she mustn't allow herself,\" he returned, \"to be too much carried\r\n",
      "away by it. But we're to have your mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and papa. It's really for Mitchy and Aggie,\" the girl went\r\n",
      "on--\"before they go abroad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah then I see what you've come up for! Tishy and I aren't in it. It's\r\n",
      "all for Mitchy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you mean there's nothing I wouldn't do for him you're quite right.\r\n",
      "He has always been of a kindness to me--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That culminated in marrying your friend?\" Vanderbank asked. \"It was\r\n",
      "charming certainly, and I don't mean to diminish the merit of it. But\r\n",
      "Aggie herself, I gather, is of a charm now--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't she?\"--Nanda was eager. \"Hasn't she come out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With a bound--into the arena. But when a young person's out with\r\n",
      "Mitchy--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you mustn't say anything against that. I've been out with him\r\n",
      "myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but my dear child--!\" Van frankly argued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not, however, a thing to notice. \"I knew it would be just so. It\r\n",
      "always is when they've been like that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean as she apparently WAS? But doesn't it make one wonder a\r\n",
      "little IF she was?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh she was--I know she was. And we're also to have Harold,\" Nanda\r\n",
      "continued--\"another of Mitchy's beneficiaries. It WOULD be a banquet,\r\n",
      "wouldn't it? if we were to have them all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank hesitated, and the look he fixed on the door might have\r\n",
      "suggested a certain open attention to the arrival of their hostess or\r\n",
      "the announcement of other guests. \"If you haven't got them all, the\r\n",
      "beneficiaries, you've got, in having me, I should suppose, about the\r\n",
      "biggest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah what has he done for you?\" Nanda asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again her friend hung fire. \"Do you remember something you said to me\r\n",
      "down there in August?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked vague but quite unembarrassed. \"I remember but too well that\r\n",
      "I chattered.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You declared to me that you knew everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--and I said so to Mitchy too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, my dear child, you don't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because I don't know--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, what makes ME the victim of his insatiable benevolence.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah well, if you've no doubt of it yourself that's all that's required.\r\n",
      "I'm quite GLAD to hear of something I don't know,\" Nanda pursued. \"And\r\n",
      "we're to have Harold too,\" she repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As a beneficiary? Then we SHALL fill up! Harold will give us a stamp.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Won't he? I hear of nothing but his success. Mother wrote me that\r\n",
      "people are frantic for him; and,\" said the girl after an instant, \"do\r\n",
      "you know what Cousin Jane wrote me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What WOULD she now? I'm trying to think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda relieved him of this effort. \"Why that mother has transferred to\r\n",
      "him all the scruples she felt--'even to excess'--in MY time, about what\r\n",
      "we might pick up among you all that wouldn't be good for us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's a neat one for ME!\" Vanderbank declared. \"And I like your talk\r\n",
      "about your antediluvian 'time.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it's all over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What exactly is it,\" Vanderbank presently demanded, \"that you describe\r\n",
      "in that manner?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, my little hour. And the danger of picking up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's none of it here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda appeared frankly to judge. \"No--because, really, Tishy, don't you\r\n",
      "see? is natural. We just talk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank showed his interest. \"Whereas at your mother's--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you were all afraid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank laughed straight out. \"Do you mind my telling her that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh she knows it. I've heard her say herself you were.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah _I_ was,\" he concurred. \"You know we've spoken of that before.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm speaking now of all of you,\" said Nanda. \"But it was she who was\r\n",
      "most so, for she tried--I know she did, she told me so--to control you.\r\n",
      "And it was when, you were most controlled--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van's amusement took it up. \"That we were most detrimental?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, because of course what's so awfully unutterable is just what we\r\n",
      "most notice. Tishy knows that,\" Nanda wonderfully observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the reflexion of her tone might have been caught by an observer\r\n",
      "in Vanderbank's face it was in all probability caught by his\r\n",
      "interlocutress, who superficially, however, need have recognised\r\n",
      "there--what was all she showed--but the right manner of waiting for\r\n",
      "dinner. \"The better way then is to dash right in? That's what our friend\r\n",
      "here does?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you know what she does!\" the girl replied as with a sudden drop of\r\n",
      "interest in the question. She turned at the moment to the opening of the\r\n",
      "door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Tishy who at last appeared, and her guest had his greeting ready.\r\n",
      "\"We're talking of the delicate matters as to which you think it's better\r\n",
      "to dash right in; but I'm bound to say your inviting a hungry man to\r\n",
      "dinner doesn't appear to be one of them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sign of Tishy Grendon--as it had been often called in a society in\r\n",
      "which variety of reference had brought to high perfection, for usual\r\n",
      "safety, the sense of signs--was a retarded facial glimmer that, in\r\n",
      "respect to any subject, closed up the rear of the procession. It had\r\n",
      "been said of her indeed that when processions were at all rapid she was\r\n",
      "usually to be found, on a false impression of her whereabouts, mixed up\r\n",
      "with the next; so that now, for instance, by the time she had reached\r\n",
      "the point of saying to Vanderbank \"Are you REALLY hungry?\" Nanda had\r\n",
      "begun to appeal to him for some praise of their hostess's appearance.\r\n",
      "This was of course with soft looks up and down at her clothes. \"Isn't\r\n",
      "she too nice? Did you ever see anything so lovely?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm so faint with inanition,\" Van replied to Mrs. Grendon, \"that--like\r\n",
      "the traveller in the desert, isn't it?--I only make out, as an oasis or\r\n",
      "a mirage, a sweet green rustling blur. I don't trust you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't trust YOU,\" Nanda said on her friend's behalf. \"She isn't\r\n",
      "'green'--men are amazing: they don't know the dearest old blue that ever\r\n",
      "was seen.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"IS it your 'OLD blue'?\" Vanderbank, monocular, very earnestly asked. \"I\r\n",
      "can imagine it was 'dear,' but I should have thought--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was yellow\"--Nanda helped him out--\"if I hadn't kindly told\r\n",
      "you.\" Tishy's figure showed the confidence of objects consecrated by\r\n",
      "publicity; bodily speaking a beautiful human plant, it might have taken\r\n",
      "the last November gale to account for the completeness with which,\r\n",
      "in some quarters, she had shed her leaves. Her companions could\r\n",
      "only emphasise by the direction of their eyes the nature of the\r\n",
      "responsibility with which a spectator would have seen them saddled--a\r\n",
      "choice, as to consciousness, between the effect of her being and the\r\n",
      "effect of her not being dressed. \"Oh I'm hideous--of course I know it,\"\r\n",
      "said Tishy. \"I'm only just clean. Here's Nanda now, who's beautiful,\"\r\n",
      "she vaguely continued, \"and Nanda--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but, darling, Nanda's clean too!\" the young lady in question\r\n",
      "interrupted; on which her fellow guest could only laugh with her as in\r\n",
      "relief from the antithesis of which her presence of mind had averted\r\n",
      "the completion, little indeed as in Mrs. Grendon's talk that element of\r\n",
      "style was usually involved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's nothing in such a matter,\" Vanderbank observed as if it were\r\n",
      "the least he could decently say, \"like challenging enquiry; and here's\r\n",
      "Harold, precisely,\" he went on in the next breath, \"as clear and crisp\r\n",
      "and undefiled as a fresh five-pound note.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A fresh one?\"--Harold had passed in a flash from his hostess. \"A man\r\n",
      "who like me hasn't seen one for six months could perfectly do, I assure\r\n",
      "you, with one that has lost its what-do-you-call it.\" He kissed Nanda\r\n",
      "with a friendly peck, then, more completely aware, had a straighter\r\n",
      "apprehension for Tishy. \"My dear child, YOU seem to have lost something,\r\n",
      "though I'll say for you that one doesn't miss it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grendon looked from him to Nanda. \"Does he mean anything very\r\n",
      "nasty? I can only understand you when Nanda explains,\" she returned\r\n",
      "to Harold. \"In fact there's scarcely anything I understand except\r\n",
      "when Nanda explains. It's too dreadful her being away so much now with\r\n",
      "strange people, whom I'm sure she can't begin to do for what she does\r\n",
      "for me; it makes me miss her all round. And the only thing I've come\r\n",
      "across that she CAN'T explain,\" Tishy bunched straight at her friend,\r\n",
      "\"is what on earth she's doing there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why she's working Mr. Longdon, like a good fine girl,\" Harold said;\r\n",
      "\"like a good true daughter and even, though she doesn't love me nearly\r\n",
      "so much as I love HER, I will say, like a good true sister. I'm bound\r\n",
      "to tell you, my dear Tishy,\" he went on, \"that I think it awfully happy,\r\n",
      "with the trend of manners, for any really nice young thing to be a bit\r\n",
      "lost to sight. London, upon my honour, is quite too awful for girls, and\r\n",
      "any big house in the country is as much worse--with the promiscuities\r\n",
      "and opportunities and all that--as you know for yourselves. _I_ know\r\n",
      "some places,\" Harold declared, \"where, if I had any girls, I'd see 'em\r\n",
      "shot before I'd take 'em.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you know too much, my dear boy!\" Vanderbank remarked with\r\n",
      "commiseration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah my brave old Van,\" the youth returned, \"don't speak as if YOU had\r\n",
      "illusions. I know,\" he pursued to the ladies, \"just where some of Van's\r\n",
      "must have perished, and some of the places I've in mind are just where\r\n",
      "he has left his tracks. A man must be wedded to sweet superstitions\r\n",
      "not nowadays to HAVE to open his eyes. Nanda love,\" he benevolently\r\n",
      "concluded, \"stay where you are. So at least I shan't blush for you. That\r\n",
      "you've the good fortune to have reached your time of life with so little\r\n",
      "injury to your innocence makes you a case by yourself, of which we\r\n",
      "must recognise the claims. If Tishy can't make you gasp, that's nothing\r\n",
      "against you nor against HER--Tishy comes of one of the few innocent\r\n",
      "English families that are left. Yes, you may all cry 'Oho!'--but I defy\r\n",
      "you to name me say five, or at most seven, in which some awful thing or\r\n",
      "other hasn't happened. Of course ours is one, and Tishy's is one, and\r\n",
      "Van's is one, and Mr. Longdon's is one, and that makes you, bang off,\r\n",
      "four. So there you are!\" Harold gaily wound up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see now why he's the rage!\" Vanderbank observed to Nanda.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mrs. Grendon expressed to their young friend a lingering wonder. \"Do\r\n",
      "you mean you go in for the adoption--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Tishy!\" Nanda mildly murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Harold, however, had his own tact. \"The dear man's taking her quite\r\n",
      "over? Not altogether unreservedly. I'm with the governor: I think we\r\n",
      "ought to GET something. 'Oh yes, dear man, but what do you GIVE us for\r\n",
      "her?'--that's what _I_ should say to him. I mean, don't you know, that I\r\n",
      "don't think she's making quite the bargain she might. If he were to\r\n",
      "want ME I don't say he mightn't have me, but I should have it on my\r\n",
      "conscience to make it in one way or another a good thing for my parents.\r\n",
      "You ARE nice, old woman\"--he turned to his sister--\"and one can still\r\n",
      "feel for the flower of your youth something of the wonderful 'reverence'\r\n",
      "that we were all brought up on. For God's sake therefore--all the\r\n",
      "more--don't really close with him till you've had another word or two\r\n",
      "with me. I'll be hanged\"--he appealed to the company again--\"if he shall\r\n",
      "have her for nothing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See rather,\" Vanderbank said to Mrs. Grendon, \"how little it's like\r\n",
      "your really losing her that she should be able this evening fairly to\r\n",
      "bring the dear man to you. At this rate we don't lose her--we simply get\r\n",
      "him as well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but is it quite the dear man's COMPANY we want?\"--and Harold looked\r\n",
      "anxious and acute. \"If that's the best arrangement Nanda can make--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If he hears us talking in this way, which strikes me as very horrible,\"\r\n",
      "Nanda interposed very simply and gravely, \"I don't think we're likely to\r\n",
      "get anything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Harold's talk,\" Vanderbank protested, \"offers, I think, an\r\n",
      "extraordinary interest; only I'm bound to say it crushes me to the\r\n",
      "earth. I've to make at least, as I listen to him, a big effort to bear\r\n",
      "up. It doesn't seem long ago,\" he pursued to his young friend, \"that\r\n",
      "I used to feel I was in it; but the way you bring home to me, dreadful\r\n",
      "youth, that I'm already NOT--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "down--is that it?\"\r\n",

      "\"Ah but I think I perfectly understand yours!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just my anguish--and your advantage. It's awfully curious,\"\r\n",
      "Vanderbank went on to Nanda, \"but I feel as if I must figure to him,\r\n",
      "you know, very much as Mr. Longdon figures to me. Mr. Longdon doesn't\r\n",
      "somehow get into me. Yet I do, I think, into him. But we don't matter!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'We'?\"--Nanda, with her eyes on him, echoed it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Longdon and I. It can't be helped, I suppose,\" he went on, for\r\n",

      "He was not prepared on this with the right statement, and what he did\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, who, beside Mrs. Brook, looked at him with attention, might\r\n",
      "have suspected him of turning a trifle pale; though even Vanderbank,\r\n",
      "with reasons of his own for an observation of the sharpest, could scarce\r\n",
      "have read into the matter the particular dim vision that would have\r\n",
      "accounted for it--the flicker of fear of what Mrs. Brook, whether as\r\n",

      "herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should warn you, sir,\" the young man threw off, \"how little we\r\n",
      "consider that--in Buckingham Crescent certainly--a fair question. It\r\n",
      "isn't playing the game--it's hitting below the belt. We hate and we\r\n",
      "love--the latter especially; but to tell each other why is to break that\r\n",
      "little tacit rule of finding out for ourselves which is the delight of\r\n",
      "our lives and the source of our triumphs. You can say, you know, if you\r\n",
      "like, but you're not obliged.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon transferred to him something of the same colder\r\n",
      "apprehension, looking at him manifestly harder than ever before and\r\n",
      "finding in his eyes also no doubt a consciousness more charged. He\r\n",
      "presently got up, but, without answering Vanderbank, fixed again Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook, to whom he echoed without expression: \"Hate you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next moment, while he remained in presence with Vanderbank, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook was pointing out her meaning to him from the cushioned corner he\r\n",
      "had quitted. \"Why, when you come back to town you come straight, as it\r\n",
      "were, here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah what's that,\" the Duchess asked in his interest, \"but to follow\r\n",
      "Nanda as closely as possible, or at any rate to keep well with her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook now had a smile for her. \"Ah that takes precautions then that\r\n",
      "I shall perhaps fail of if I too much interrupt your conversation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't she nice to me,\" the Duchess asked of Mr. Longdon, \"when I was in\r\n",
      "the very act of praising her to the skies?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their interlocutor's reply was not too rapid to anticipate Mrs. Brook\r\n",
      "herself. \"My dear Jane, that only proves his having reached some\r\n",
      "extravagance in the other sense that you had in mere decency to\r\n",
      "match. The truth is probably in the 'mean'--isn't that what they\r\n",
      "call it?--between you. Don't YOU now take him away,\" she went on to\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, who had glanced about for some better accommodation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He immediately pushed forward the nearest chair, which happened to be by\r\n",
      "the Duchess's side of the sofa. \"Will you sit here, sir?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you'll stay to protect me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That was really what I brought him over to you for,\" Mrs. Brook said\r\n",
      "while Mr. Longdon took his place and Vanderbank looked out for another\r\n",
      "seat. \"But I didn't know,\" she observed with her sweet free curiosity,\r\n",
      "\"that he called you 'sir.'\" She often made discoveries that were fairly\r\n",
      "childlike. \"He has done it twice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't that only your inevitable English surprise,\" the Duchess\r\n",
      "demanded, \"at the civility quite the commonest in other societies?--so\r\n",
      "that one has to come here to find it regarded, in the way of ceremony,\r\n",
      "as the very end of the world!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" Mr. Longdon remarked, \"it's a word I rather like myself even to\r\n",
      "employ to others.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I always ask here,\" the Duchess continued to him, \"what word they've\r\n",
      "got instead. And do you know what they tell me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook wondered, then again, before he was ready, charmingly\r\n",
      "suggested: \"Our pretty manner?\" Quickly too she appealed to Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "\"Is THAT what you miss from me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wondered, however, more than Mrs. Brook. \"Your 'pretty manner'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, these grand old forms that the Duchess is such a mistress of.\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook had with this one of her eagerest visions. \"Did mamma say\r\n",
      "'sir' to you? Ought _I_? Do you really get it, in private, out of Nanda?\r\n",
      "SHE has such depths of discretion,\" she explained to the Duchess and to\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, who had come back with his chair, \"that it's just the kind\r\n",
      "of racy anecdote she never in the world gives me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon looked across at Van, placed now, after a moment's talk\r\n",
      "with Tishy in sight of them all, by Mrs. Brook's arm of the sofa. \"You\r\n",
      "haven't protected--you've only exposed me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh there's no joy without danger\"--Mrs. Brook took it up with spirit.\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps one should even say there's no danger without joy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's eyes had followed Mrs. Grendon after his brief passage with\r\n",
      "her, terminated by some need of her listless presence on the other side\r\n",
      "of the room. \"What do you say then, on that theory, to the extraordinary\r\n",
      "gloom of our hostess? Her safety, by such a rule, must be deep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess was this time the first to know what they said. \"The\r\n",
      "expression of Tishy's face comes precisely from our comparing it so\r\n",
      "unfavourably with that of her poor sister Carrie, who, though she isn't\r\n",
      "here to-night with the Cashmores--amazing enough even as coming WITHOUT\r\n",
      "that!--has so often shown us that an ame en peine, constantly tottering,\r\n",
      "but, as Nanda guarantees us, usually recovering, may look after all as\r\n",
      "beatific as a Dutch doll.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook's eyes had, on Tishy's passing away, taken the same course as\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's, whom she had visibly not neglected moreover while the pair\r\n",
      "stood there. \"I give you Carrie, as you know, and I throw Mr. Cashmore\r\n",
      "in; but I'm lost in admiration to-night, as I always have been, of\r\n",
      "the way Tishy makes her ugliness serve. I should call it, if the word\r\n",
      "weren't so for ladies'-maids, the most 'elegant' thing I know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child,\" the Duchess objected, \"what you describe as making\r\n",
      "her ugliness serve is what I should describe as concealing none of her\r\n",
      "beauty. There's nothing the matter surely with 'elegant' as applied\r\n",
      "to Tishy save that as commonly used it refers rather to a charm that's\r\n",
      "artificial than to a state of pure nature. There should be for elegance\r\n",
      "a basis of clothing. Nanda rather stints her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, perhaps more than usually thoughtful, just discriminated.\r\n",
      "\"There IS, I think, one little place. I'll speak to her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Tishy?\" Vanderbank asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh THAT would do no good. To Nanda. All the same,\" she continued, \"it's\r\n",
      "an awfully superficial thing of you not to see that her dreariness--on\r\n",
      "which moreover I've set you right before--is a mere facial accident and\r\n",
      "doesn't correspond or, as they say, 'rhyme' to anything within her that\r\n",
      "might make it a little interesting. What I like it for is just that it's\r\n",
      "so funny in itself. Her low spirits are nothing more than her features.\r\n",
      "Her gloom, as you call it, is merely her broken nose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"HAS she a broken nose?\" Mr. Longdon demanded with an accent that for\r\n",
      "some reason touched in the others the spring of laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has Nanda never mentioned it?\" Mrs. Brook profited by this gaiety to\r\n",
      "ask.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's the discretion you just spoke of,\" said the Duchess. \"Only\r\n",
      "I should have expected from the cause you refer to rather the comic\r\n",
      "effect.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Grendon's broken nose, sir,\" Vanderbank explained to Mr. Longdon,\r\n",
      "\"is only the kinder way taken by these ladies to speak of Mrs. Grendon's\r\n",
      "broken heart. You must know all about that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--ALL.\" Mr. Longdon spoke very simply, with the consequence this\r\n",
      "time, on the part of his companions, of a silence of some minutes, which\r\n",
      "he himself had at last to break. \"Mr. Grendon doesn't like her.\" The\r\n",
      "addition of these words apparently made the difference--as if they\r\n",
      "constituted a fresh link with the irresistible comedy of things. That\r\n",
      "he was unexpectedly diverting was, however, no check to Mr. Longdon's\r\n",
      "delivering his full thought. \"Very horrid of two sisters to be both, in\r\n",
      "their marriages, so wretched.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but Tishy, I maintain,\" Mrs. Brook returned, \"ISN'T wretched at all.\r\n",
      "If I were satisfied that she's really so I'd never let Nanda come to\r\n",
      "her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's the most extraordinary doctrine, love,\" the Duchess interposed.\r\n",
      "\"When you're satisfied a woman's 'really' poor you never give her a\r\n",
      "crust?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you call Nanda a crust, Duchess?\" Vanderbank amusedly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's all at any rate, apparently, just now, that poor Tishy has to\r\n",
      "live on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're severe then,\" the young man said, \"on our dinner of to-night.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Jane,\" Mrs. Brook declared, \"is never severe: she's only\r\n",
      "uncontrollably witty. It's only Tishy moreover who gives out that her\r\n",
      "husband doesn't like her. HE, poor man, doesn't say anything of the\r\n",
      "sort.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but, after all, you know\"--Vanderbank just put it to her--\"where\r\n",
      "the deuce, all the while, IS he?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heaven forbid,\" the Duchess remarked, \"that we should too rashly\r\n",
      "ascertain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There it is--exactly,\" Mr. Longdon subjoined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had once more his success of hilarity, though not indeed to the\r\n",
      "injury of the Duchess's next word. \"It's Nanda, you know, who speaks,\r\n",
      "and loud enough, for Harry Grendon's dislikes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's easy for her,\" Mrs. Brook declared, \"when she herself isn't one\r\n",
      "of them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She isn't surely one of anybody's,\" Mr. Longdon gravely observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook gazed across at him. \"You ARE too dear! But I've none the\r\n",
      "less a crow to pick with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon returned her look, but returned it somehow to Van. \"You\r\n",
      "frighten me, you know, out of my wits.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_I_ do?\" said Vanderbank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon just hesitated. \"Yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It must be the sacred terror,\" Mrs. Brook suggested to Van, \"that\r\n",
      "Mitchy so often speaks of. I'M not trying with you,\" she went on to Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon, \"for anything of that kind, but only for the short half-hour\r\n",
      "in private that I think you won't for the world grant me. Nothing will\r\n",
      "induce you to find yourself alone with me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why what on earth,\" Vanderbank asked, \"do you suspect him of supposing\r\n",
      "you want to do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it isn't THAT,\" Mrs. Brook sadly said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It isn't what?\" laughed the Duchess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That he fears I may want in any way to--what do you call it?--make up\r\n",
      "to him.\" She spoke as if she only wished it had been. \"He has a deeper\r\n",
      "thought.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then what in goodness is it?\" the Duchess pressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had said nothing more, but Mrs. Brook preferred none the\r\n",
      "less to treat the question as between themselves. She WAS, as the\r\n",
      "others said, wonderful. \"You can't help thinking me\"--she spoke to him\r\n",
      "straight--\"rather tortuous.\" The pause she thus momentarily produced was\r\n",
      "so intense as to give a sharpness that was almost vulgar to the little\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" by which it was presently broken and the source of which neither\r\n",
      "of her three companions could afterwards in the least have named.\r\n",
      "Neither would have endeavoured to fix an infelicity of which each\r\n",
      "doubtless had been but too capable. \"It's only as a mother,\" she added,\r\n",
      "\"that I want my chance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the Duchess was at this again in the breach. \"Take it, for mercy's\r\n",
      "sake then, my dear, over Harold, who's an example to Nanda herself\r\n",
      "in the way that, behind the piano there, he's keeping it up with Lady\r\n",
      "Fanny.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If this had been a herring that, in the interest of peace, the Duchess\r\n",
      "had wished to draw across the scent, it could scarce have been more\r\n",
      "effective. Mrs. Brook, whose position had made just the difference that\r\n",
      "she lost the view of the other side of the piano, took a slight but\r\n",
      "immediate stretch. \"IS Harold with Lady Fanny?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You ask it, my dear child,\" said the Duchess, \"as if it were too\r\n",
      "grand to be believed. It's the note of eagerness,\" she went on for Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon's benefit--\"it's almost the note of hope: one of those that ces\r\n",
      "messieurs, that we all in fact delight in and find so matchless. She\r\n",
      "desires for Harold the highest advantages.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then,\" declared Vanderbank, who had achieved a glimpse, \"he's\r\n",
      "clearly having them. It brings home to one his success.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His success is true,\" Mrs. Brook insisted. \"How he does it I don't\r\n",
      "know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh DON'T you?\" trumpeted the Duchess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's amazing,\" Mrs. Brook pursued. \"I watch--I hold my breath. But I'm\r\n",
      "bound to say also I rather admire. He somehow amuses them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's as pleased as Punch,\" said the Duchess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Those great calm women--they like slighter creatures.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The great calm whales,\" the Duchess laughed, \"swallow the little\r\n",
      "fishes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh my dear,\" Mrs. Brook returned, \"Harold can be tasted, if you like--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If _I_ like?\" the Duchess parenthetically jeered. \"Thank you, love!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But he can't, I think, be eaten. It all works out,\" Mrs. Brook\r\n",
      "expounded, \"to the highest end. If Lady Fanny's amused she'll be quiet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bless me,\" cried the Duchess, \"of all the immoral speeches--! I put it\r\n",
      "to you, Longdon. Does she mean\"--she appealed to their friend--\"that if\r\n",
      "she commits murder she won't commit anything else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it won't be murder,\" said Mrs. Brook. \"I mean that if Harold, in one\r\n",
      "way and another, keeps her along, she won't get off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Off where?\" Mr. Longdon risked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank immediately informed him. \"To one of the smaller Italian\r\n",
      "towns. Don't you know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes. Like--who is it? I forget.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Anna Karenine? You know about Anna?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nanda,\" said the Duchess, \"has told him. But I thought,\" she went on to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, \"that Lady Fanny, by this time, MUST have gone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Petherton then,\" Mrs. Brook returned, \"doesn't keep you au courant?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess blandly wondered. \"I seem to remember he had positively said\r\n",
      "so. And that she had come back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because this looks so like a fresh start? No. WE know. You assume\r\n",
      "besides,\" Mrs. Brook asked, \"that Mr. Cashmore would have received her\r\n",
      "again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duchess fixed a little that gentleman and his actual companion.\r\n",
      "\"What will you have? He mightn't have noticed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you're out of step, Duchess,\" Vanderbank said. \"We used all to march\r\n",
      "abreast, but we're falling to pieces. It's all, saving your presence,\r\n",
      "Mitchy's marriage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" Mrs. Brook concurred, \"how thoroughly I feel that! Oh I knew. The\r\n",
      "spell's broken; the harp has lost a string. We're not the same thing.\r\n",
      "HE'S not the same thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Frankly, my dear,\" the Duchess answered, \"I don't think that you\r\n",
      "personally are either.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh as for that--which is what matters least--we shall perhaps see.\"\r\n",
      "With which Mrs. Brook turned again to Mr. Longdon. \"I haven't explained\r\n",
      "to you what I meant just now. We want Nanda.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon stared. \"At home again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In her little old nook. You must give her back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean altogether?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah that will be for you in a manner to arrange. But you've had her\r\n",
      "practically these five months, and with no desire to be unreasonable we\r\n",
      "yet have our natural feelings.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This interchange, to which circumstances somehow gave a high effect of\r\n",
      "suddenness and strangeness, was listened to by the others in a quick\r\n",
      "silence that was like the sense of a blast of cold air, though with the\r\n",
      "difference between the spectators that Vanderbank attached his eyes hard\r\n",
      "to Mrs. Brook and that the Duchess looked as straight at Mr. Longdon, to\r\n",
      "whom clearly she wished to convey that if he had wondered a short time\r\n",
      "before how Mrs. Brook would do it he must now be quite at his ease. He\r\n",
      "indulged in fact, after this lady's last words, in a pause that might\r\n",

      "Edward Brookenham, who within a minute had come in from the other room;\r\n",

      "must be a match for the priestess. \"'Want' her, Jane? We wouldn't TAKE\r\n",

      "that Mrs. Brook found, as she exclaimed that her husband was always so\r\n",
      "awfully civil, just the right note of resigned understanding; whereupon\r\n",
      "he for a minute presented to them blankly enough his fine dead face.\r\n",
      "\"'Civil' is just what I was afraid I wasn't. I mean, you know,\" he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Edward Brookenham.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it, Jane\"--Mrs. Brook continued to take it beautifully. \"We\r\n",
      "dressed to-day in a hurry and hadn't time for our usual rehearsal.\r\n",

      "and six jokes. I leave the management of the handkerchiefs to his own\r\n",
      "taste, but we mostly try together in advance to arrange a career for the\r\n",
      "other things. It's some charming light thing of my own that's supposed\r\n",
      "to give him the sign.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only sometimes he confounds\"--Vanderbank helped her out--\"your light\r\n",

      "occasions and, having forced him into the empty chair, now moved vaguely\r\n",
      "off to the quarter of the room occupied by Nanda and Mr. Cashmore.\r\n",

      "finger on Nanda's true interest. He doesn't care a bit how it would LOOK\r\n",
      "for you to want her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "parents and yet to get from you everything you'll give. I do the\r\n",
      "sentimental and he the practical; so that we, after one fashion and\r\n",
      "another, deck ourselves in the glory of our sacrifice without forfeiting\r\n",
      "the 'keep' of our daughter. This must appeal to you as another useful\r\n",
      "illustration of what London manners have come to; unless indeed,\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook prattled on, \"it only strikes you still more--and to a degree that\r\n",

      "too tortuous for you to know what I'd be at!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon faced her, across his interval, with his original terror\r\n",

      "natural tribute to a brilliant scene. \"I haven't the glimmering of an\r\n",
      "idea of what you'd be at. But please understand,\" he added, \"that I\r\n",

      "else had taken place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His wife fixed her eyes on him. \"The ingenuity of your companions, love,\r\n",

      "by good fortune, to leave it unscathed. Still, you have after all your\r\n",
      "own strange wit, and I'm not sure that any of ours ever compares with\r\n",
      "it. Only, confronted also with ours, how can poor Mr. Longdon really\r\n",
      "choose which of the two he'll meet?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Mr. Longdon now looked hard at Edward. \"Oh Mr. Brookenham's, I\r\n",

      "rather have that private half-hour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Done!\" Mrs. Brook declared. \"I'll send him to you. But we HAVE, you\r\n",

      "approach to her from behind, though it was impossible she should have\r\n",
      "seen him, she had visibly within a minute become aware. \"It's your\r\n",

      "more than we even yet know, and most grossly and horribly, my dear man,\r\n",
      "changed YOU. You steal up in a way that gives one the creeps, whereas\r\n",
      "in the good time that's gone you always burst in with music and song.\r\n",
      "Go round where I can see you: I mayn't love you now, but at least, I\r\n",
      "suppose, I may look at you. Direct your energies,\" she pursued while\r\n",
      "Mitchy obeyed her, \"as much as possible, please, against our uncanny\r\n",

      "you know--and all the more that Tishy, I see, is getting rid of her\r\n",
      "superfluities. Here comes back old Van,\" she wound up, \"vanquished, I\r\n",
      "judge, in the attempt to divert Nanda from her prey. Won't Nanda sit\r\n",
      "with poor US?\" she asked of Vanderbank, who now, meeting Mitchy in range\r\n",
      "of the others, remained standing with him and as at her commands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I didn't of course ask her,\" the young man replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then what did you do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I only took a little walk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, on this, was woeful at Mitchy. \"See then what we've come\r\n",
      "to. When did we ever 'walk' in YOUR time save as a distinct part of\r\n",
      "the effect of our good things? Please return to Nanda,\" she said to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, in her apprehension, had looked expressively at their\r\n",
      "friends, but the eye of the Duchess wandered no further than Harold and\r\n",
      "Lady Fanny. \"It would perhaps serve to keep that pair a little longer\r\n",
      "from escaping together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook took a pause no greater. \"But wouldn't it be, as regards\r\n",
      "another pair, locking the stable-door after--what do you call it? Don't\r\n",
      "Petherton and Aggie appear already to have escaped together? Mitchy,\r\n",
      "man, where in the world's your wife?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I quite grant you,\" said the Duchess gaily, \"that my niece is wherever\r\n",
      "Petherton is. This I'm sure of, for THERE'S a friendship, if you please,\r\n",
      "that has not been interrupted. Petherton's not gone, is he?\" she asked\r\n",
      "in her turn of Mitchy.\r\n",

      "Harold too after a minute and on perceiving the movement of the others,\r\n",
      "ended by enlarging it, with mutual accommodation and aid, to a pleasant\r\n",
      "talkative ring in which the subject of their companion's demonstration,\r\n",
      "on a low ottoman and glaring in his odd way in almost all directions at\r\n",
      "once, formed the conspicuous attractive centre. Tishy was nearest\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, and Nanda, still flanked by Mr. Cashmore, between that\r\n",
      "gentleman and his wife, who had Harold on her other side. Edward\r\n",
      "Brookenham was neighboured by his son and by Vanderbank, who might\r\n",
      "easily have felt himself, in spite of their separation and given, as it\r\n",
      "happened, their places in the group, rather publicly confronted with Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon. \"Is his wife in the other room?\" Mrs. Brook now put to Tishy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tishy, after a stare about, recovered the acuter consciousness to\r\n",
      "account for this guest. \"Oh yes--she's playing with him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But with whom, dear?\"\r\n",

      "\"Why, with Petherton. I thought you knew.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "resonance, observed to Vanderbank.\r\n",

      "\"Brilliant indeed!\" Vanderbank replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But she's rather naughty, you know,\" Edward after a pause continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh fiendish!\" his interlocutor said with a short smothered laugh that\r\n",
      "might have represented for a spectator a sudden start at such a flash of\r\n",
      "analysis from such a quarter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Vanderbank's attention at any rate was free again their hostess,\r\n",
      "assisted to the transition, was describing the play, as she had called\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"He can't compass his desperate end? Ah I hope he won't pull her off!\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook wonderfully murmured. It was said in a manner that stirred\r\n",
      "the circle, and unanimous laughter seemed already to have crowned her\r\n",
      "invocation, lately uttered, to the social spirit. \"But what in the\r\n",
      "world,\" she pursued, \"is the book selected for such a position? I hope\r\n",

      "particular benefit, \"that Lord Petherton's trying to wrest it.\"\r\n",

      "a flower tended and guarded, should find from one day to the other her\r\n",
      "whole consciousness changed? People pull long faces and look wonderful\r\n",
      "looks and punch each other, in your English fashion, in the sides, and\r\n",

      "take her a very long one? I dare say there are girls it would have taken\r\n",
      "longer, just as there are certainly others who wouldn't have required so\r\n",

      "THAT--rather! If she's so clever that you don't know what to do with her\r\n",
      "it's scarcely HER fault. But add to it that Mitchy's very kind, and you\r\n",
      "have the whole thing. What more do you want?\"\r\n",

      "yet been snatched.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Mrs. Brook naturally who rattled the standard. \"When you say,\r\n",
      "dearest, that we don't know what to 'do' with Aggie's cleverness, do you\r\n",
      "quite allow for the way we bow down before it and worship it? I don't\r\n",
      "quite see what else we--in here--can do with it, even though we HAVE\r\n",
      "gathered that, just over there, Petherton's finding for it a different\r\n",
      "application. We can only each in our way do our best. Don't therefore\r\n",
      "succumb, Jane, to the delusive harm of a grievance. There would be\r\n",
      "nothing in it. You haven't got one. The beauty of the life that so many\r\n",
      "of us have so long led together\"--and she showed that it was for Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon she more particularly brought this out--\"is precisely that\r\n",
      "nobody has ever had one. Nobody has dreamed of it--it would have been\r\n",
      "such a rough false note, a note of violence out of all keeping. Did\r\n",
      "YOU ever hear of one, Van? Did you, my poor Mitchy? But you see for\r\n",
      "yourselves,\" she wound up with a sigh and before either could answer,\r\n",
      "\"how inferior we've become when we have even in our defence to assert\r\n",
      "such things.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, who for a while past had sat gazing at the floor, now raised his\r\n",
      "good natural goggles and stretched his closed mouth to its widest. \"Oh I\r\n",
      "think we're pretty good still!\" he then replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook indeed appeared, after a pause and addressing herself again\r\n",
      "to Tishy, to give a reluctant illustration of it, coming back as from\r\n",
      "an excursion of the shortest to the question momentarily dropped. \"I'm\r\n",
      "bound to say--all the more you know--that I don't quite see what Aggie\r\n",
      "mayn't now read.\" Suddenly, however, her look at their informant took on\r\n",
      "an anxiety. \"Is the book you speak of something VERY awful?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grendon, with so much these past minutes to have made her so, was\r\n",
      "at last visibly more present. \"That's what Lord Petherton says of it.\r\n",
      "From what he knows of the author.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So that he wants to keep her--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, from trying it first. I think he wants to see if it's good for\r\n",
      "her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's one of the most charming soins, I think,\" the Duchess said,\r\n",
      "\"that a gentleman may render a young woman to whom he desires to be\r\n",
      "useful. I won't say that Petherton always knows how good a book may be,\r\n",
      "but I'd trust him any day to say how bad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, who had sat throughout silent and still, quitted his seat\r\n",
      "at this and evidently in so doing gave Mrs. Brook as much occasion as\r\n",
      "she required. She also got up and her movement brought to her view\r\n",
      "at the door of the further room something that drew from her a quick\r\n",
      "exclamation. \"He can tell us now then--for here they come!\" Lord\r\n",
      "Petherton, arriving with animation and followed so swiftly by his young\r\n",
      "companion that she presented herself as pursuing him, shook triumphantly\r\n",
      "over his head a small volume in blue paper. There was a general movement\r\n",
      "at the sight of them, and by the time they had rejoined their friends\r\n",
      "the company, pushing back seats and causing a variety of mute expression\r\n",
      "smoothly to circulate, was pretty well on its feet. \"See--he HAS pulled\r\n",
      "her off!\" said Mrs. Brook. \"Little Aggie, to whom plenty of pearls were\r\n",
      "singularly becoming, met it as pleasant sympathy. Yes, and it was a REAL\r\n",
      "pull. But of course,\" she continued with the prettiest humour and as if\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook would quite understand, \"from the moment one has a person's\r\n",
      "nails, and almost his teeth, in one's flesh--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook's sympathy passed, however, with no great ease from Aggie's\r\n",
      "pearls to her other charms; fixing the former indeed so markedly that\r\n",
      "Harold had a quick word about it for Lady Fanny. \"When poor mummy\r\n",
      "thinks, you know, that Nanda might have had them--!\"\r\n",

      "\"Well, I dare say that if I had wanted _I_ might!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord--COULD you have stood him?\" the young man returned. \"But I\r\n",
      "believe women can stand anything!\" he profoundly concluded. His mother\r\n",
      "meanwhile, recovering herself, had begun to ejaculate on the prints\r\n",
      "in Aggie's arms, and he was then diverted from the sense of what he\r\n",
      "\"personally,\" as he would have said, couldn't have stood, by a glance at\r\n",
      "Lord Petherton's trophy, for which he made a prompt grab. \"The bone of\r\n",
      "contention?\" Lord Petherton had let it go and Harold remained arrested\r\n",
      "by the cover. \"Why blest if it hasn't Van's name!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Van's?\"--his mother was near enough to effect her own snatch, after\r\n",
      "which she swiftly faced the proprietor of the volume. \"Dear man, it's\r\n",
      "the last thing you lent me! But I don't think,\" she added, turning to\r\n",
      "Tishy, \"that I ever passed such a production on to YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was just seeing Mr. Van's hand,\" Aggie conscientiously explained,\r\n",
      "\"that made me think one was free--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it isn't Mr. Van's hand!\"--Mrs. Brook quite smiled at the error.\r\n",
      "She thrust the book straight at Mr. Longdon. \"IS that Mr. Van's hand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holding the disputed object, which he had put on his nippers to glance\r\n",
      "at, he presently, without speaking, looked over these aids straight at\r\n",
      "Nanda, who looked as straight back at him. \"It was I who wrote Mr. Van's\r\n",

      "by accident in the other room.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By accident, my dear,\" her mother replied, \"I do quite hope. But what\r\n",
      "on earth did you bring it for? It's too hideous.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda seemed to wonder. \"Is it?\" she murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you haven't read it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She just hesitated. \"One hardly knows now, I think, what is and what\r\n",
      "isn't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She brought it only for ME to read,\" Tishy gravely interposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook looked strange. \"Nanda RECOMMENDED it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no--the contrary.\" Tishy, as if scared by so much publicity,\r\n",
      "floundered a little. \"She only told me--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The awful subject?\" Mrs. Brook wailed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was so deepening an echo of the drollery of this last passage\r\n",
      "that it was a minute before Vanderbank could be heard saying: \"The\r\n",
      "responsibility's wholly mine for setting the beastly thing in motion.\r\n",
      "Still,\" he added good-humouredly and as to minimise if not the cause at\r\n",
      "least the consequence, \"I think I agree with Nanda that it's no worse\r\n",
      "than anything else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook had recovered the volume from Mr. Longdon's relaxed hand and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank showed for the next short time by his behaviour what he felt\r\n",
      "at not yet being free to act on this; moving pointlessly about the room\r\n",
      "while the servants arranged the tea-table and taking no trouble to make,\r\n",
      "for appearance, any other talk. Mrs. Brook, on her side, took so little\r\n",
      "that the silence--which their temporary companions had all the effect of\r\n",
      "keeping up by conscious dawdling--became precisely one of those precious\r\n",
      "lights for the circle belowstairs which people fondly fancy they have\r\n",
      "not kindled when they have not spoken. But Vanderbank spoke again as\r\n",
      "soon as the door was closed. \"Does he run in and out that way without\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "it with HER?\"\r\n",

      "He balanced a moment. \"Does she have a tea of her own?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean to say you don't know?\"--Mrs. Brook asked it with surprise.\r\n",
      "\"Such ignorance of what I do for her does tell, I think, the tale of how\r\n",
      "you've lately treated us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In not coming for so long?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For more weeks, for more months than I can count. Scarcely since--when\r\n",

      "offered the tea to his choice. \"WILL you have it upstairs?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He received the cup. \"Yes, and here too.\" After which he said nothing\r\n",

      "intelligence. We've fallen to pieces, and at least I'm not such a fool\r\n",
      "as not to have felt it in time. From the moment one did feel it why\r\n",
      "should one insist on vain forms? If YOU felt it, and were so ready\r\n",
      "to drop them, my part was what it has always been--to accept the\r\n",
      "inevitable. We shall never grow together again. The smash was too\r\n",
      "great.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank for a little said nothing; then at last: \"You ought to know\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"The smash,\" he replied, \"was indeed as complete, I think, as your\r\n",

      "did it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She appeared to wonder where he was going. \"But surely not MY minutes.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You did it that night at Mrs. Grendon's.\" He spoke as if he had not\r\n",

      "closing with each of the great columns in its turn--as Samson pulled\r\n",
      "down the temple. I was at the time more or less bruised and buried\r\n",

      "happened. But I understand now.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'm stupid compared with you, but you see I've taken my time.\r\n",
      "I've puzzled it out. I've lain awake on it: all the more that I've had\r\n",

      "\"Never a word.\"\r\n",

      "days later, as I afterwards gathered, was to be crowned with a measure\r\n",
      "of success not yet exhausted. Why, in other words--if it was to know\r\n",
      "so little about her and to get no nearer to her--did you bring about\r\n",
      "Nanda's return?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a clear reason, her face said, if she could only remember it.\r\n",

      "course I see Jane--though not so often either. It's from Jane I've heard\r\n",
      "of what she calls her 'young things.' It seems so odd to think of Mitchy\r\n",
      "as a young thing. He's as old as all time, and his wife, who the other\r\n",
      "day was about six, is now practically about forty. And I also saw\r\n",

      "disgust.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, who appeared to have been timing himself, put up his watch.\r\n",
      "\"I'm bound to say then that with separations so established I understand\r\n",
      "less than ever your unforgettable explosion.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you come back to that?\" she wearily asked. \"And you find it, with\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but there was a wild light in your eye--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Mrs. Brook said, \"you see it now quite gone out.\" She had\r\n",

      "flicker. \"I called Nanda in because I wanted to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Precisely; but what I don't make out, you see, is what you've since\r\n",
      "gained by it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean she only hates me the more?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van's impatience, in the movement with which he turned from her, had a\r\n",
      "flare still sharper. \"You know I'm incapable of meaning anything of the\r\n",
      "sort.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She waited a minute while his back was presented. \"I sometimes think in\r\n",
      "effect that you're incapable of anything straightforward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank's movement had not been to the door, but he almost reached it\r\n",
      "after giving her, on this, a hard look. He then stopped short, however,\r\n",
      "to stare an instant still more fixedly into the hat he held in his hand;\r\n",
      "the consequence of which in turn was that he the next minute stood again\r\n",
      "before her chair. \"Don't you call it straightforward of me just not to\r\n",
      "have come for so long?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had again to take time to say. \"Is that an allusion to what--by the\r\n",
      "loss of your beautiful presence--I've failed to 'gain'? I dare say at\r\n",
      "any rate\"--she gave him no time to reply--\"that you feel you're quite as\r\n",
      "straightforward as I and that we're neither of us creatures of mere rash\r\n",
      "impulse. There was a time in fact, wasn't there? when we rather enjoyed\r\n",
      "each other's dim depths. If I wanted to fawn on you,\" she went on, \"I\r\n",
      "might say that, with such a comrade in obliquity to wind and double\r\n",
      "about with, I'd risk losing myself in the mine. But why retort or\r\n",
      "recriminate? Let us not, for God's sake, be vulgar--we haven't yet, bad\r\n",
      "as it is, come to THAT. I CAN be, no doubt--I some day MUST be: I feel\r\n",
      "it looming at me out of the awful future as an inevitable fate. But let\r\n",
      "it be for when I'm old and horrible; not an hour before. I do want to\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"There it is. And I like much better,\" Mrs. Brook went on, \"our speaking\r\n",
      "of it as delicacy than as duplicity. If you understand, it's so much\r\n",
      "saved.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What I always understand more than anything else,\" he returned, \"is the\r\n",
      "general truth that you're prodigious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, to take up what lies there, you yet so splendidly abstain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You literally press upon me my opportunity? It's YOU who are splendid!\"\r\n",
      "she rather strangely laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you at least want to say,\" he went on with a slight flush, \"what\r\n",
      "you MOST obviously and naturally might?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Appealed to on the question of underlying desire, Mrs. Brook went\r\n",
      "through the decent form of appearing to try to give it the benefit of\r\n",
      "any doubt. \"Don't I want, you mean, to find out before you go up what\r\n",
      "YOU want? Shall you be too disappointed,\" she asked, \"if I say that,\r\n",
      "since I shall probably learn, as we used to be told as children, 'all in\r\n",
      "good time,' I can wait till the light comes out of itself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank still lingered. \"You ARE deep!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've only to be deeper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's easy to say. I'm afraid at any rate you won't think I am,\" he\r\n",
      "pursued after a pause, \"if I ask you what in the world--since Harold\r\n",
      "does keep Lady Fanny so quiet--Cashmore still requires Nanda's direction\r\n",
      "for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah find out!\" said Mrs. Brook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't Mrs. Donner quite shelved?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Find out,\" she repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank had reached the door and had his hand on the latch, but there\r\n",
      "was still something else. \"You scarce suppose, I imagine, that she has\r\n",
      "come to like him 'for himself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Find out!\" And Mrs. Brook, who was now on her feet, turned away. He\r\n",
      "watched her a moment more, then checked himself and left her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She remained alone ten minutes, at the end of which her reflexions\r\n",
      "would have been seen to be deep--were interrupted by the entrance of her\r\n",
      "husband. The interruption was indeed not so great as if the couple had\r\n",
      "not met, as they almost invariably met, in silence: she took at all\r\n",
      "events, to begin with, no more account of his presence than to hand him\r\n",
      "a cup of tea accompanied with nothing but cream and sugar. Her having\r\n",
      "no word for him, however, committed her no more to implying that he had\r\n",
      "come in only for his refreshment than it would have committed her to\r\n",
      "say: \"Here it is, Edward dear--just as you like it; so take it and sit\r\n",
      "down and be quiet.\" No spectator worth his salt could have seen them\r\n",
      "more than a little together without feeling how everything that,\r\n",
      "under his eyes or not, she either did or omitted, rested on a profound\r\n",
      "acquaintance with his ways. They formed, Edward's ways, a chapter by\r\n",
      "themselves, of which Mrs. Brook was completely mistress and in respect\r\n",
      "to which the only drawback was that a part of her credit was by the\r\n",
      "nature of the case predestined to remain obscure. So many of them were\r\n",
      "so queer that no one but she COULD know them, and know thereby into what\r\n",
      "crannies her reckoning had to penetrate. It was one of them for instance\r\n",
      "that if he was often most silent when most primed with matter, so\r\n",
      "when he had nothing to say he was always silent too--a peculiarity\r\n",
      "misleading, until mastered, for a lady who could have allowed in the\r\n",
      "latter case for almost any variety of remark. \"What do you think,\" he\r\n",
      "said at last, \"of his turning up to-day?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of old Van's?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh has HE turned up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Half an hour ago, and asking almost in his first breath for Nanda. I\r\n",
      "sent him up to her and he's with her now.\" If Edward had his ways she\r\n",
      "had also some of her own; one of which, in talk with him, if talk it\r\n",
      "could be called, was never to produce anything till the need was marked.\r\n",
      "She had thus a card or two always in reserve, for it was her theory\r\n",
      "that she never knew what might happen. It nevertheless did occur that he\r\n",
      "sometimes went, as she would have called it, one better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's not with her now. I've just been with her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then he didn't go up?\" Mrs. Brook was immensely interested. \"He left\r\n",
      "me, you know, to do so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Know--how should I know? I left her five minutes ago.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then he went out without seeing her.\" Mrs. Brook took it in. \"He\r\n",
      "changed his mind out there on the stairs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Edward, \"it won't be the first mind that has been changed\r\n",
      "there. It's about the only thing a man can change.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you refer particularly to MY stairs?\" she asked with her whimsical\r\n",
      "woe. But meanwhile she had taken it in. \"Then whom were you speaking\r\n",
      "of?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Longdon's coming to tea with her. She has had a note.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But when did he come to town?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Last night, I believe. The note, an hour or two ago, announced\r\n",
      "him--brought by hand and hoping she'd be at home.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook thought again. \"I'm glad she is. He's too sweet. By hand!--it\r\n",
      "must have been so he sent them to mamma. He wouldn't for the world\r\n",
      "wire.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Nanda has often wired to HIM,\" her father returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then she ought to be ashamed of herself. But how,\" said Mrs. Brook, \"do\r\n",
      "you know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know when we're in a thing like this.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yet you complain of her want of intimacy with you! It turns out that\r\n",
      "you're as thick as thieves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Edward looked at this charge as he looked at all old friends, without\r\n",
      "a sign--to call a sign--of recognition. \"I don't know of whose want of\r\n",
      "intimacy with me I've ever complained. There isn't much more of it, that\r\n",
      "I can see, that any of them could put on. What do you suppose I'd have\r\n",
      "them do? If I on my side don't get very far I may have alluded to THAT.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but you do,\" Mrs. Brook declared. \"You think you don't, but you\r\n",
      "get very far indeed. You're always, as I said just now, bringing out\r\n",
      "something that you've got somewhere.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and seeing you flare up at it. What I bring out is only what they\r\n",
      "tell me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This limitation offered, however, for Mrs. Brook no difficulty. \"Ah but\r\n",
      "it seems to me that with the things people nowadays tell one--! What\r\n",
      "more do you want?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well\"--and Edward from his chair regarded the fire a while--\"the\r\n",
      "difference must be in what they tell YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Things that are better?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--worse. I dare say,\" he went on, \"what I give them--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't as bad as what I do? Oh we must each do our best. But when I hear\r\n",
      "from you,\" Mrs. Brook pursued, \"that Nanda had ever permitted herself\r\n",
      "anything so dreadful as to wire to him, it comes over me afresh that _I_\r\n",
      "would have been the perfect one to deal with him if his detestation of\r\n",
      "me hadn't prevented.\" She was by this time also--but on her feet--before\r\n",
      "the fire, into which, like her husband, she gazed. \"_I_ would never have\r\n",
      "wired. I'd have gone in for little delicacies and odd things she has\r\n",
      "never thought of.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh she doesn't go in for what you do,\" Edward assented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's as bleak as a chimney-top when the fire's out, and if it hadn't\r\n",
      "been after all for mamma--!\" And she lost herself again in the reasons\r\n",
      "of things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her husband's silence seemed to mark for an instant a deference to her\r\n",
      "allusion, but there was a limit even to this combination. \"You make your\r\n",
      "mother, I think, keep it up pretty well. But if she HADN'T as you say,\r\n",
      "done so--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why we shouldn't have been anywhere.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Following her own train she had at first no heed for his question.\r\n",
      "\"Without his hatred he would have liked me.\" But she came back with a\r\n",
      "sigh to the actual. \"No matter. We must deal with what we've got.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What HAVE we got?\" Edward continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again with no ear for his question his wife turned away, only however,\r\n",
      "after taking a few vague steps, to approach him with new decision.\r\n",
      "\"If Mr. Longdon's due will you do me a favour? Will you go back to\r\n",

      "ME, that Van has been here half an hour, has had it put well before\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"If I liked better,\" said Mrs. Brook, \"I'd have already done it. The\r\n",
      "way to make it not come from me is surely not for me to give it to her.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Edward still communed with the fire. \"And what's the point of THAT?\" Her\r\n",
      "impatience, which visibly increased, carried her away again, and by the\r\n",
      "time she reached the window he had launched another question. \"Are you\r\n",
      "in such a hurry she should know that Van doesn't want her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "sound was partly the effect of the disclosure of a servant preceding a\r\n",
      "visitor. His greeting of the visitor before edging past and away was,\r\n",
      "however, of the briefest; it might have implied that they had met but\r\n",

      "Very different was Mrs. Brook's welcome of the restored wanderer to\r\n",
      "whom, in a brief space, she addressed every expression of surprise and\r\n",
      "delight, though marking indeed at last, as a qualification of these\r\n",
      "things, her regret that he declined to partake of her tea or to allow\r\n",
      "her to make him what she called \"snug for a talk\" in his customary\r\n",
      "corner of her sofa. He pleaded frankly agitation and embarrassment,\r\n",
      "reminded her even that he was awfully shy and that after separations,\r\n",
      "complications, whatever might at any time happen, he was conscious of\r\n",
      "the dust that had settled on intercourse and that he couldn't blow away\r\n",
      "in a single breath. She was only, according to her nature, to indulge\r\n",
      "him if, while he walked about and changed his place, he came to the\r\n",
      "surface but in patches and pieces. There was so much he wanted to know\r\n",
      "that--well, as they had arrived only the night before, she could judge.\r\n",
      "There was knowledge, it became clear, that Mrs. Brook almost equally\r\n",
      "craved, so that it even looked at first as if, on either side,\r\n",
      "confidence might be choked by curiosity. This disaster was finally\r\n",
      "barred by the fact that the spirit of enquiry found for Mitchy material\r\n",
      "that was comparatively plastic. That was after all apparent enough when\r\n",
      "at the end of a few vain passes he brought out sociably: \"Well, has he\r\n",
      "done it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still indeed there was something in Mrs. Brook's face that seemed to\r\n",
      "reply \"Oh come--don't rush it, you know!\" and something in the movement\r\n",
      "with which she turned away that described the state of their question\r\n",
      "as by no means so simple as that. On his refusal of tea she had rung for\r\n",
      "the removal of the table, and the bell was at this moment answered by\r\n",
      "the two men. Little ensued then, for some minutes, while the servants\r\n",
      "were present; she spoke only as the butler was about to close the door.\r\n",
      "\"If Mr. Longdon presently comes show him into Mr. Brookenham's room if\r\n",
      "Mr. Brookenham isn't there. If he is show him into the dining-room and\r\n",

      "see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy glared about. \"Well, don't take it ill if, in return for that, I\r\n",
      "say I myself want to see every one. I could have done even just now with\r\n",
      "a little more of Edward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, in her own manner and with a slow headshake, looked lovely.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At this, suddenly dropping everything else, she laid her hand on him.\r\n",
      "\"Mitchy love, ARE you happy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Well, you've still GOT me, you know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Mitchy, \"I've got a great deal. How, if I really look at it,\r\n",
      "can a man of my peculiar nature--it IS, you know, awfully peculiar--NOT\r\n",
      "be happy? Think, if one is driven to it for instance, of the breadth of\r\n",
      "my sympathies.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Brook, as a result of thinking, appeared for a little to demur.\r\n",
      "\"Yes--but one mustn't be too much driven to it. It's by one's sympathies\r\n",
      "that one suffers. If you should do that I couldn't bear it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She clearly evoked for Mitchy a definite image. \"It WOULD be funny,\r\n",
      "wouldn't it? But you wouldn't have to. I'd go off and do it alone\r\n",
      "somewhere--in a dark room, I think, or on a desert island; at any rate\r\n",
      "where nobody should see. Where's the harm moreover,\" he went on, \"of\r\n",
      "any suffering that doesn't bore one, as I'm sure, however much its outer\r\n",
      "aspect might amuse some others, mine wouldn't bore me? What I should\r\n",
      "do in my desert island or my dark room, I feel, would be just to\r\n",
      "dance about with the thrill of it--which is exactly the exhibition of\r\n",
      "ludicrous gambols that I would fain have arranged to spare you. I assure\r\n",
      "you, dear Mrs. Brook,\" he wound up, \"that I'm not in the least bored\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But he pursued without heeding: \"Was perhaps what you had in your head\r\n",
      "that _I_ should see him--?\"\r\n",

      "She came back but slowly, however, to the moment. \"Mr. Longdon? Well,\r\n",
      "yes. You know he can't bear ME--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "for him without his arriving at the right moment to take up the business\r\n",
      "so richly put before him in his previous interview. No less time indeed\r\n",

      "his old friend's general style, simple recognitions and decencies. There\r\n",
      "was a limit to the mere allusiveness with which, in Mr. Longdon's school\r\n",
      "of manners, a foreign tour might be treated, and Mitchy, no doubt,\r\n",
      "plentifully showed that none of his frequent returns had encountered a\r\n",
      "curiosity at once so explicit and so discreet. To belong to a circle in\r\n",
      "which most of the members might be at any moment on the other side of\r\n",
      "the globe was inevitably to fall into the habit of few questions, as\r\n",
      "well as into that of making up for their fewness by their freedom.\r\n",
      "This interlocutor in short, while Mrs. Brook's representative\r\n",

      "charmingly--since it was but a tribute to common courtesy--into the\r\n",
      "Virgilian associations of the Bay of Naples. Finally, however, he\r\n",
      "started, his eye having turned to the clock. \"I'm afraid that, though\r\n",

      "the escape from their hostess--these were all things Mitchy could\r\n",

      "his occasion. \"I see, I see--I shall make you keep Nanda waiting. But\r\n",
      "there's something I shall ask you to take from me quite as a sufficient\r\n",
      "basis for that: which is simply that after all, you know--for I think\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not sure,\" his friend replied, \"that I ought quite to mention\r\n",
      "anything she has 'told' me. I speak of what I've made out myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I thank you more than I can say for your penetration. Her mother,\r\n",
      "I should let you know,\" Mitchy continued, \"is with her just now.\"\r\n",

      "broken her leg. But something, none the less, has happened to her--that\r\n",
      "I think I may say. To tell you all in a word, it's the reason, such as\r\n",
      "it is, of my being here to meet you. Mrs. Brook asked me to wait. She'll\r\n",
      "see you herself some other time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon wondered. \"And Nanda too?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"She understands my delay?\"\r\n",

      "took this in silence, \"But you don't like it?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It only comes to me that Mrs. Brook's explanations--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are often so odd? Oh yes; but Nanda, you know, allows for that oddity.\r\n",
      "And Mrs. Brook, by the same token,\" Mitchy developed, \"knows herself--no\r\n",
      "one better--what may frequently be thought of it. That's precisely the\r\n",
      "reason of her desire that you should have on this occasion explanations\r\n",
      "from a source that she's so good as to pronounce, for the immediate\r\n",
      "purpose, superior. As for Nanda,\" he wound up, \"to be aware that we're\r\n",
      "here together won't strike her as so bad a sign.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" Mr. Longdon attentively assented; \"she'll hardly fear we're\r\n",
      "plotting her ruin. But what then has happened to her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mitchy, \"it's you, I think, who will have to give it a\r\n",
      "name. I know you know what I've known.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, his nippers again in place, hesitated. \"Yes, I know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you've accepted it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How could I help it? To reckon with such cleverness--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Was beyond you? Ah it wasn't my cleverness,\" Mitchy said. \"There's a\r\n",
      "greater than mine. There's a greater even than Van's. That's the whole\r\n",
      "point,\" he went on while his friend looked at him hard. \"You don't even\r\n",
      "like it just a little?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon wondered. \"The existence of such an element--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; the existence simply of my knowledge of your idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I suppose I'm bound to keep in mind in fairness the existence of my own\r\n",
      "knowledge of yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mitchy gave that the go-by. \"Oh I've so many 'ideas'! I'm always\r\n",
      "getting hold of some new one and for the most part trying it--generally\r\n",
      "to let it go as a failure. Yes, I had one six months ago. I tried that.\r\n",
      "I'm trying it still.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I hope,\" said Mr. Longdon with a gaiety slightly strained, \"that,\r\n",
      "contrary to your usual rule, it's a success.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a gaiety, for that matter, that Mitchy's could match. \"It does\r\n",
      "promise well! But I've another idea even now, and it's just what I'm\r\n",
      "again trying.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On me?\" Mr. Longdon still somewhat extravagantly smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy thought. \"Well, on two or three persons, of whom you ARE the\r\n",
      "first for me to tackle. But what I must begin with is having from you\r\n",
      "that you recognise she trusts us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy's idea after an instant had visibly gone further. \"Both of\r\n",
      "them--the two women up there at present so strangely together. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Brook must too; immensely. But for that you won't care.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had relapsed into an anxiety more natural than his\r\n",
      "expression of a moment before. \"It's about time! But if Nanda didn't\r\n",
      "trust us,\" he went on, \"her case would indeed be a sorry one. She has\r\n",
      "nobody else to trust.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes.\" Mitchy's concurrence was grave. \"Only you and me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only you and me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The eyes of the two men met over it in a pause terminated at last by\r\n",
      "Mitchy's saying: \"We must make it all up to her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that your idea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Mitchy gently, \"don't laugh at it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend's grey gloom again covered him. \"But what CAN--?\" Then as\r\n",
      "Mitchy showed a face that seemed to wince with a silent \"What COULD?\"\r\n",
      "the old man completed his objection. \"Think of the magnitude of the\r\n",
      "loss.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't for a moment suggest,\" Mitchy hastened to reply, \"that it\r\n",
      "isn't immense.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She does care for him, you know,\" said Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy, at this, gave a wide, prolonged glare. \"'Know'--?\" he ever so\r\n",
      "delicately murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His irony had quite touched. \"But of course you know! You know\r\n",
      "everything--Nanda and you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a tone in it that moved a spring, and Mitchy laughed out. \"I\r\n",
      "like your putting me with her! But we're all together. With Nanda,\" he\r\n",
      "next added, \"it IS deep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion took it from him. \"Deep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet somehow it isn't abject.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man wondered. \"'Abject'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean it isn't pitiful. In its way,\" Mitchy developed, \"it's happy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This too, though rather ruefully, Mr. Longdon could take from him.\r\n",
      "\"Yes--in its way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Any passion so great, so complete,\" Mitchy went on, \"is--satisfied or\r\n",
      "unsatisfied--a life.\" Mr. Longdon looked so interested that his fellow\r\n",
      "visitor, evidently stirred by what was now an appeal and a dependence,\r\n",
      "grew still more bland, or at least more assured, for affirmation. \"She's\r\n",
      "not TOO sorry for herself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah she's so proud!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but that's a help.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh--not for US!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It arrested Mitchy, but his ingenuity could only rebound. \"In ONE\r\n",
      "way: that of reducing us to feel that the desire to 'make up' to her\r\n",
      "is--well, mainly for OUR relief. If she 'trusts' us, as I said just now,\r\n",
      "it isn't for THAT she does so.\" As his friend appeared to wait then to\r\n",
      "hear, it was presently with positive joy that he showed he could meet\r\n",
      "the last difficulty. \"What she trusts us to do\"--oh Mitchy had worked it\r\n",
      "out!--\"is to let HIM off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let him off?\" It still left Mr. Longdon dim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Easily. That's all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what would letting him off hard be? It seems to me he's--on any\r\n",
      "terms--already beyond us. He IS off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had given it a sound that suddenly made Mitchy appear to\r\n",
      "collapse under a sharper sense of the matter. \"He IS off,\" he moodily\r\n",
      "echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion, again a little bewildered, watched him; then with\r\n",
      "impatience: \"Do, please, tell me what has happened.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He quickly pulled himself round. \"Well, he was, after a long absence,\r\n",
      "here a while since as if expressly to see her. But after spending half\r\n",
      "an hour he went away without it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's watch continued. \"He spent the half-hour with her mother\r\n",
      "instead?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh 'instead'--it was hardly that. He at all events dropped his idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what had it been, his idea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You speak as if he had as many as I!\" Mitchy replied. \"In a manner\r\n",
      "indeed he has,\" he continued as if for himself. \"But they're of a\r\n",
      "different kind,\" he said to Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What had it been, his idea?\" the old man, however, simply repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy's confession at this seemed to explain his previous evasion. \"We\r\n",
      "shall never know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon hesitated. \"He won't tell YOU?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Me?\" Mitchy had a pause. \"Less than any one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many things they had not spoken had already passed between them, and\r\n",
      "something evidently, to the sense of each, passed during the moment that\r\n",
      "followed this. \"While you were abroad,\" Mr. Longdon presently asked,\r\n",
      "\"did you hear from him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never. And I wrote nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like me,\" said Mr. Longdon. \"I've neither written nor heard.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but with you it will be different.\" Mr. Longdon, as if with the\r\n",
      "outbreak of an agitation hitherto controlled, had turned abruptly away\r\n",
      "and, with the usual swing of his glass, begun almost wildly to wander.\r\n",
      "\"You WILL hear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall be curious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon thoughtfully rambled. \"Too much--?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The elder man for a while said nothing more, but he at last came back.\r\n",

      "with more mute interchange. \"She doesn't want HIM to have lost--!\"\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, however, on this, once more broke off while Mitchy's\r\n",
      "eyes followed him. \"Doesn't it give a sort of measure of what she may\r\n",
      "feel--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had paused, working it out again with the effect of his friend's\r\n",
      "returning afresh to be fed with his light. \"Doesn't what give it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why the fact that we still like him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon stared. \"Do YOU still like him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I didn't how should I mind--?\" But on the utterance of it Mitchy\r\n",
      "fairly pulled up.\r\n",

      "terror.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The companions for a little seemed to stand together in this element;\r\n",
      "after which the elder turned once more away and appeared to continue to\r\n",
      "walk in it. \"Poor Nanda!\" then, in a far-off sigh, came across from him\r\n",
      "to Mitchy. Mitchy on this turned vaguely round to the fire, into which\r\n",
      "he remained gazing till he heard again Mr. Longdon's voice. \"I knew\r\n",

      "\"CAN we?\" Mitchy smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And HE can respect us,\" his friend, as if not hearing him, went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy seemed almost to demur. \"He must think we're 'rum.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Mrs. Brook's worse than rum. He can't respect HER.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh that will be perhaps,\" Mitchy laughed, \"what she'll get just most\r\n",
      "out of!\" It was the first time of Mr. Longdon's showing that even after\r\n",
      "a minute he had not understood him; so that as quickly as possible he\r\n",
      "passed to another point. \"If you do anything may I be in it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what can I do? If it's over it's over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For HIM, yes. But not for her or for you or for me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Oh I mean I shan't last for ever.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, since you so expressed it yourself, that's what I mean too. I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Help me?\" Mr. Longdon interrupted, looking at him hard.\r\n",

      "It made him a little awkward. \"Help you to help her, you know--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're very wonderful,\" Mr. Longdon presently returned. \"A year and a\r\n",
      "half ago you wanted to help me to help Mr. Vanderbank.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mitchy, \"you can't quite say I haven't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But your ideas of help are of a splendour--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I've told you about my ideas.\" Mitchy was almost apologetic. Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon had a pause. \"I suppose I'm not indiscreet then in recognising\r\n",
      "your marriage as one of them. And that, with a responsibility so great\r\n",
      "already assumed, you appear fairly eager for another--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Makes me out a kind of monster of benevolence?\" Mitchy looked at it\r\n",
      "with a flushed face. \"The two responsibilities are very much one and the\r\n",
      "same. My marriage has brought me, as it were, only nearer to Nanda. My\r\n",
      "wife and she, don't you see? are particular friends.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, on his side, turned a trifle pale; he looked rather hard\r\n",

      "I\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda Brookenham, for a fortnight after Mr. Longdon's return, had found\r\n",
      "much to think of; but the bustle of business became, visibly for us,\r\n",
      "particularly great with her on a certain Friday afternoon in June. She\r\n",
      "was in unusual possession of that chamber of comfort in which so much\r\n",
      "of her life had lately been passed, the redecorated and rededicated room\r\n",
      "upstairs in which she had enjoyed a due measure both of solitude and\r\n",
      "of society. Passing the objects about her in review she gave especial\r\n",
      "attention to her rather marked wealth of books; changed repeatedly, for\r\n",
      "five minutes, the position of various volumes, transferred to tables\r\n",
      "those that were on shelves and rearranged shelves with an eye to the\r\n",
      "effect of backs. She was flagrantly engaged throughout indeed in the\r\n",
      "study of effect, which moreover, had the law of an extreme freshness not\r\n",
      "inveterately prevailed there, might have been observed to be traceable\r\n",
      "in the very detail of her own appearance. \"Company\" in short was in the\r\n",
      "air and expectation in the picture. The flowers on the little tables\r\n",
      "bloomed with a consciousness sharply taken up by the glitter of\r\n",
      "nick-nacks and reproduced in turn in the light exuberance of cushions\r\n",
      "on sofas and the measured drop of blinds in windows. The numerous\r\n",
      "photographed friends in particular were highly prepared, with small\r\n",
      "intense faces, each, that happened in every case to be turned to the\r\n",
      "door. The pair of eyes most dilated perhaps was that of old Van, present\r\n",
      "under a polished glass and in a frame of gilt-edged morocco that spoke\r\n",
      "out, across the room, of Piccadilly and Christmas, and visibly widening\r\n",
      "his gaze at the opening of the door, at the announcement of a name by a\r\n",
      "footman and at the entrance of a gentleman remarkably like him save as\r\n",
      "the resemblance was on the gentleman's part flattered. Vanderbank had\r\n",
      "not been in the room ten seconds before he showed ever so markedly that\r\n",
      "he had arrived to be kind. Kindness therefore becomes for us, by a quick\r\n",
      "turn of the glass that reflects the whole scene, the high pitch of the\r\n",
      "concert--a kindness that almost immediately filled the place, to\r\n",
      "the exclusion of everything else, with a familiar friendly voice, a\r\n",
      "brightness of good looks and good intentions, a constant though perhaps\r\n",
      "sometimes misapplied laugh, a superabundance almost of interest,\r\n",
      "inattention and movement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first thing the young man said was that he was tremendously glad she\r\n",
      "had written. \"I think it was most particularly nice of you.\" And this\r\n",
      "thought precisely seemed, as he spoke, a flower of the general bloom--as\r\n",
      "if the niceness he had brought in was so great that it straightway\r\n",
      "converted everything to its image. \"The only thing that upset me a\r\n",
      "little,\" he went on, \"was your saying that before writing it you had so\r\n",
      "hesitated and waited. I hope very much, you know, that you'll never do\r\n",
      "anything of that kind again. If you've ever the slightest desire to see\r\n",
      "me--for no matter what reason, if there's ever the smallest thing of any\r\n",
      "sort that I can do for you, I promise you I shan't easily forgive you if\r\n",
      "you stand on ceremony. It seems to me that when people have known each\r\n",
      "other as long as you and I there's one comfort at least they may treat\r\n",
      "themselves to. I mean of course,\" Van developed, \"that of being easy and\r\n",
      "frank and natural. There are such a lot of relations in which one isn't,\r\n",
      "in which it doesn't pay, in which 'ease' in fact would be the greatest\r\n",
      "of troubles and 'nature' the greatest of falsities. However,\" he\r\n",
      "continued while he suddenly got up to change the place in which he had\r\n",
      "put his hat, \"I don't really know why I'm preaching at such a rate, for\r\n",
      "I've a perfect consciousness of not myself requiring it. One does half\r\n",
      "the time preach more or less for one's self, eh? I'm not mistaken at all\r\n",
      "events, I think, about the right thing with YOU. And a hint's enough\r\n",
      "for you, I'm sure, on the right thing with me.\" He had been looking all\r\n",
      "round while he talked and had twice shifted his seat; so that it was\r\n",
      "quite in consonance with his general admiring notice that the next\r\n",
      "impression he broke out with should have achieved some air of relevance.\r\n",
      "\"What extraordinarily lovely flowers you have and how charming you've\r\n",
      "made everything! You're always doing something--women are always\r\n",
      "changing the position of their furniture. If one happens to come in in\r\n",
      "the dark, no matter how well one knows the place, one sits down on a\r\n",
      "hat or a puppy-dog. But of course you'll say one doesn't come in in the\r\n",
      "dark, or at least, if one does, deserves what one gets. Only you know\r\n",
      "the way some women keep their rooms. I'm bound to say YOU don't, do\r\n",
      "you?--you don't go in for flower-pots in the windows and half a dozen\r\n",
      "blinds. Why SHOULD you? You HAVE got a lot to show!\" He rose with this\r\n",
      "for the third time, as the better to command the scene. \"What I mean is\r\n",
      "that sofa--which by the way is awfully good: you do, my dear Nanda, go\r\n",
      "it! It certainly was HERE the last time, wasn't it? and this thing was\r\n",
      "there. The last time--I mean the last time I was up here--was fearfully\r\n",
      "long ago: when, by the way, WAS it? But you see I HAVE been and that\r\n",
      "I remember it. And you've a lot more things now. You're laying up\r\n",
      "treasure. Really the increase of luxury--! What an awfully jolly lot\r\n",
      "of books--have you read them all? Where did you learn so much about\r\n",
      "bindings?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He continued to talk; he took things up and put them down; Nanda sat in\r\n",
      "her place, where her stillness, fixed and colourless, contrasted with\r\n",
      "his rather flushed freedom, and appeared only to wait, half in surprise,\r\n",
      "half in surrender, for the flow of his suggestiveness to run its course,\r\n",
      "so that, having herself provoked the occasion, she might do a little\r\n",
      "more to meet it. It was by no means, however, that his presence in any\r\n",
      "degree ceased to prevail; for there were minutes during which her face,\r\n",
      "the only thing in her that moved, turning with his turns and following\r\n",
      "his glances, actually had a look inconsistent with anything but\r\n",
      "submission to almost any accident. It might have expressed a desire for\r\n",
      "his talk to last and last, an acceptance of any treatment of the hour\r\n",
      "or any version, or want of version, of her act that would best suit his\r\n",
      "ease, even in fact a resigned prevision of the occurrence of something\r\n",
      "that would leave her, quenched and blank, with the appearance of having\r\n",
      "made him come simply that she might look at him. She might indeed well\r\n",
      "have been aware of an inability to look at him little enough to make\r\n",
      "it flagrant that she had appealed to him for something quite different.\r\n",
      "Keeping the situation meanwhile thus in his hands he recognised over the\r\n",
      "chimney a new alteration. \"There used to be a big print--wasn't there?\r\n",
      "a thing of the fifties--we had lots of them at home; some place or other\r\n",
      "'in the olden time.' And now there's that lovely French glass. So you\r\n",
      "see.\" He spoke as if she had in some way gainsaid him, whereas he had\r\n",
      "not left her time even to answer a question. But he broke out anew on\r\n",
      "the beauty of her flowers. \"You have awfully good ones--where do you get\r\n",
      "them? Flowers and pictures and--what are the other things people have\r\n",
      "when they're happy and superior?--books and birds. You ought to have a\r\n",
      "bird or two, though I dare say you think that by the noise I make I'm\r\n",
      "as good myself as a dozen. Isn't there some girl in some story--it isn't\r\n",
      "Scott; what is it?--who had domestic difficulties and a cage in her\r\n",
      "window and whom one associates with chickweed and virtue? It isn't\r\n",
      "Esmeralda--Esmeralda had a poodle, hadn't she?--or have I got my\r\n",
      "heroines mixed? You're up here yourself like a heroine; you're perched\r\n",
      "in your tower or what do you call it?--your bower. You quite hang over\r\n",
      "the place, you know--the great wicked city, the wonderful London sky and\r\n",
      "the monuments looming through: or am I again only muddling up my Zola?\r\n",
      "You must have the sunsets--haven't you? No--what am I talking about? Of\r\n",
      "course you look north. Well, they strike me as about the only thing you\r\n",
      "haven't. At the same time it's not only because I envy you that I feel\r\n",
      "humiliated. I ought to have sent you some flowers.\" He smote himself\r\n",
      "with horror, throwing back his head with a sudden thought. \"Why in\r\n",
      "goodness when I got your note didn't I for once in my life do something\r\n",
      "really graceful? I simply liked it and answered it. Here I am. But I've\r\n",
      "brought nothing. I haven't even brought a box of sweets. I'm not a man\r\n",
      "of the world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Most of the flowers here,\" Nanda at last said, \"come from Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "Don't you remember his garden?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank, in quick response, called it up. \"Dear yes--wasn't it\r\n",
      "charming? And that morning you and I spent there\"--he was so careful to\r\n",
      "be easy about it--\"talking under the trees.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You had gone out to be quiet and read--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you came out to look after me. Well, I remember,\" Van went on,\r\n",
      "\"that we had some good talk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The talk, Nanda's face implied, had become dim to her; but there were\r\n",
      "other things. \"You know he's a great gardener--I mean really one of the\r\n",
      "greatest. His garden's like a dinner in a house where the person--the\r\n",
      "person of the house--thoroughly knows and cares.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see. And he sends you dishes from the table.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Often--every week. It comes to the same thing--now that he's in town\r\n",
      "his gardener does it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Charming of them both!\" Vanderbank exclaimed. \"But his gardener--that\r\n",
      "extraordinarily tall fellow with the long red beard--was almost as nice\r\n",
      "as himself. I had talks with HIM too and remember every word he said. I\r\n",
      "remember he told me you asked questions that showed 'a deal of study.'\r\n",
      "But I thought I had never seen all round such a charming lot of\r\n",
      "people--I mean as those down there that our friend has got about him.\r\n",
      "It's an awfully good note for a man, pleasant servants, I always think,\r\n",
      "don't you? Mr. Longdon's--and quite without their saying anything; just\r\n",
      "from the sort of type and manner they had--struck me as a kind of chorus\r\n",
      "of praise. The same with Mitchy's at Mertle, I remember,\" Van rambled\r\n",
      "on. \"Mitchy's the sort of chap who might have awful ones, but I\r\n",
      "recollect telling him that one quite felt as if it were with THEM one\r\n",
      "had come to stay. Good note, good note,\" he cheerfully repeated. \"I'm\r\n",
      "bound to say, you know,\" he continued in this key, \"that you've a jolly\r\n",
      "sense for getting in with people who make you comfortable. Then, by the\r\n",
      "way, he's still in town?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda waited. \"Do you mean Mr. Mitchy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh HE is, I know--I met them two nights ago; and by the way\r\n",
      "again--don't let me forget--I want to speak to you about his wife. But\r\n",
      "I've not seen, do you know? Mr. Longdon--which is really too awful.\r\n",
      "Twice, thrice I think, have I at moments like this one snatched myself\r\n",
      "from pressure; but there's no finding the old demon at any earthly hour.\r\n",
      "When do YOU go--or does he only come here? Of course I see you've got\r\n",
      "the place arranged for him. When I asked at his hotel at what hour he\r\n",
      "ever IS in, blest if the fellow didn't say 'very often, sir, about ten!'\r\n",
      "And when I said 'Ten P. M.?' he quite laughed at my innocence over a\r\n",
      "person of such habits. What ARE his habits then now, and what are you\r\n",
      "putting him up to? Seriously,\" Vanderbank pursued, \"I AM awfully sorry\r\n",
      "and I wonder if, the first time you've a chance, you'd kindly tell him\r\n",
      "you've heard me say so and that I mean yet to run him to earth. The same\r\n",
      "really with the dear Mitchys. I didn't somehow, the other night, in such\r\n",
      "a lot of people, get at them. But I sat opposite to Aggie all through\r\n",
      "dinner, and that puts me in mind. I should like volumes from you about\r\n",
      "Aggie, please. It's too revolting of me not to go to see her. But every\r\n",
      "one knows I'm busy. We're up to our necks!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can't tell you,\" said Nanda, \"how kind I think it of you to have\r\n",
      "found, with all you have to do, a moment for THIS. But please, without\r\n",
      "delay, let me tell you--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Practically, however, he would let her tell him nothing; his almost\r\n",
      "aggressive friendly optimism clung so to references of short range.\r\n",
      "\"Don't mention it, please. It's too charming of you to squeeze me in. To\r\n",
      "see YOU moreover does me good. Quite distinct good. And your writing me\r\n",
      "touched me--oh but really. There were all sorts of old things in it.\"\r\n",
      "Then he broke out once more on her books, one of which for some minutes\r\n",
      "past he had held in his hand. \"I see you go in for sets--and, my dear\r\n",
      "child, upon my word, I see, BIG sets. What's this?--'Vol. 23: The\r\n",
      "British Poets.' Vol. 23 is delightful--do tell me about Vol. 23. Are\r\n",
      "you doing much in the British Poets? But when the deuce, you wonderful\r\n",
      "being, do you find time to read? _I_ don't find any--it's too hideous.\r\n",
      "One relapses in London into such illiteracy and barbarism. I have to\r\n",
      "keep up a false glitter to hide in conversation my rapidly increasing\r\n",
      "ignorance: I should be so ashamed after all to see other people NOT\r\n",
      "shocked by it. But teach me, teach me!\" he gaily went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The British Poets,\" Nanda immediately answered, \"were given me by Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon, who has given me all the good books I have except a few--those\r\n",
      "in that top row--that have been given me at different times by Mr.\r\n",
      "Mitchy. Mr. Mitchy has sent me flowers too, as well as Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "And they're both--since we've spoken of my seeing them--coming by\r\n",
      "appointment this afternoon; not together, but Mr. Mitchy at 5.30 and Mr.\r\n",
      "Longdon at 6.30.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had spoken as with conscious promptitude, making up for what she had\r\n",
      "not yet succeeded in saying by a quick, complete statement of her case.\r\n",
      "She was evidently also going on with more, but her actual visitor had\r\n",
      "already taken her up with a laugh. \"You ARE making a day of it and you\r\n",
      "run us like railway-trains!\" He looked at his watch. \"Have _I_ then\r\n",
      "time?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It seems to me I should say 'Have _I_?' But it's not half-past four,\"\r\n",
      "Nanda went on, \"and though I've something very particular of course to\r\n",
      "say to you it won't take long. They don't bring tea till five, and you\r\n",
      "must surely stay till that. I had already written to you when they\r\n",
      "each, for the same reason, proposed this afternoon. They go out of town\r\n",
      "to-morrow for Sunday.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I see--and they have to see you first. What an influence you exert,\r\n",
      "you know, on people's behaviour!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She continued as literal as her friend was facetious. \"Well, it just\r\n",
      "happened so, and it didn't matter, since, on my asking you, don't you\r\n",
      "know? to choose your time, you had taken, as suiting you best, this\r\n",
      "comparatively early hour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh perfectly.\" But he again had his watch out. \"I've a job,\r\n",
      "perversely--that was my reason--on the other side of the world; which,\r\n",
      "by the way, I'm afraid, won't permit me to wait for tea. My tea doesn't\r\n",
      "matter.\" The watch went back to his pocket. \"I'm sorry to say I must be\r\n",
      "off before five. It has been delightful at all events to see you again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was on his feet as he spoke, and though he had been half the time on\r\n",
      "his feet his last words gave the effect of his moving almost immediately\r\n",
      "to the door. It appeared to come out with them rather clearer than\r\n",
      "before that he was embarrassed enough really to need help, and it was\r\n",
      "doubtless the measure she after an instant took of this that enabled\r\n",
      "Nanda, with a quietness all her own, to draw to herself a little more of\r\n",
      "the situation. The quietness was plainly determined for her by a quick\r\n",
      "vision of its being the best assistance she could show. Had he an inward\r\n",
      "terror that explained his superficial nervousness, the incoherence of\r\n",
      "a loquacity designed, it would seem, to check in each direction her\r\n",
      "advance? He only fed it in that case by allowing his precautionary\r\n",
      "benevolence to put him in so much deeper. Where indeed could he have\r\n",
      "supposed she wanted to come out, and what that she could ever do for\r\n",
      "him would really be so beautiful as this present chance to smooth his\r\n",
      "confusion and add as much as possible to that refined satisfaction with\r\n",
      "himself which would proceed from his having dealt with a difficult hour\r\n",
      "in a gallant and delicate way? To force upon him an awkwardness was\r\n",
      "like forcing a disfigurement or a hurt, so that at the end of a minute,\r\n",
      "during which the expression of her face became a kind of uplifted view\r\n",
      "of her opportunity, she arrived at the appearance of having changed\r\n",
      "places with him and of their being together precisely in order that\r\n",
      "he--not she--should be let down easily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But surely you're not going already?\" she asked. \"Why in the world then\r\n",
      "do you suppose I appealed to you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bless me, no; I've lots of time.\" He dropped, laughing for very\r\n",
      "eagerness, straight into another chair. \"You're too awfully interesting.\r\n",
      "Is it really an 'appeal'?\" Putting the question indeed he could scarce\r\n",
      "even yet allow her a chance to answer it. \"It's only that you make me\r\n",
      "a little nervous with your account of all the people who are going to\r\n",
      "tumble in. And there's one thing more,\" he quickly went on; \"I just want\r\n",
      "to make the point in case we should be interrupted. The whole fun is in\r\n",
      "seeing you this way alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is THAT the point?\" Nanda, as he took breath, gravely asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's a part of it--I feel it, I assure you, to be charming. But what\r\n",
      "I meant--if you'd only give me time, you know, to put in a word--is what\r\n",
      "for that matter I've already told you: that it almost spoils my pleasure\r\n",
      "for you to keep reminding me that a bit of luck like this--luck for ME:\r\n",
      "I see you coming!--is after all for you but a question of business. Hang\r\n",
      "business! Good--don't stab me with that paper-knife. I listen. What IS\r\n",
      "the great affair?\" Then as it looked for an instant as if the words she\r\n",
      "had prepared were just, in the supreme pinch of her need, falling apart,\r\n",
      "he once more tried his advantage. \"Oh if there's any difficulty about it\r\n",
      "let it go--we'll take it for granted. There's one thing at any rate--do\r\n",
      "let me say this--that I SHOULD like you to keep before me: I want before\r\n",
      "I go to make you light up for me the question of little Aggie. Oh there\r\n",
      "are other questions too as to which I regard you as a perfect fountain\r\n",
      "of curious knowledge! However, we'll take them one by one--the next some\r\n",
      "other time. You always seem to me to hold the strings of such a lot of\r\n",
      "queer little dramas. Have something on the shelf for me when we meet\r\n",
      "again. THE thing just now is the outlook for Mitchy's affair. One cares\r\n",
      "enough for old Mitch to fancy one may feel safer for a lead or two. In\r\n",
      "fact I want regularly to turn you on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but the thing I happen to have taken it into my head to say to you,\"\r\n",
      "Nanda now securely enough replied, \"hasn't the least bit to do, I assure\r\n",
      "you, either with Aggie or with 'old Mitch.' If you don't want to hear\r\n",
      "it--want some way of getting off--please believe THEY won't help you a\r\n",
      "bit.\" It was quite in fact that she felt herself at last to have found\r\n",
      "the right tone. Nothing less than a conviction of this could have made\r\n",
      "her after an instant add: \"What in the world, Mr. Van, are you afraid\r\n",
      "of?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, that it WAS the right tone a single little minute was sufficient\r\n",
      "to prove--a minute, I must yet haste to say, big enough in spite of its\r\n",
      "smallness to contain the longest look on any occasion exchanged between\r\n",
      "these friends. It was one of those looks--not so frequent, it must be\r\n",
      "admitted, as the muse of history, dealing at best in short cuts, is\r\n",
      "often by the conditions of her trade reduced to representing them--which\r\n",
      "after they have come and gone are felt not only to have changed\r\n",
      "relations but absolutely to have cleared the air. It certainly helped\r\n",
      "Vanderbank to find his answer. \"I'm only afraid, I think, of your\r\n",
      "conscience.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had been indeed for the space more helped than she. \"My conscience?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Think it over--quite at your leisure--and some day you'll understand.\r\n",
      "There's no hurry,\" he continued--\"no hurry. And when you do understand,\r\n",
      "it needn't make your existence a burden to you to fancy you must tell\r\n",
      "me.\" Oh he was so kind--kinder than ever now. \"The thing is, you see,\r\n",
      "that _I_ haven't a conscience. I only want my fun.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had on this a second look, also decidedly comfortable, though\r\n",
      "discounted, as the phrase is, by the other, which had really in its\r\n",
      "way exhausted the possibilities of looks. \"Oh I want MY fun too,\" said\r\n",
      "Nanda, \"and little as it may strike you in some ways as looking like it,\r\n",
      "just this, I beg you to believe, is the real thing. What's at the bottom\r\n",
      "of it,\" she went on, \"is a talk I had not long ago with mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" Van returned with brightly blushing interest. \"The fun,\" he\r\n",
      "laughed, \"that's to be got out of 'mother'!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'm not thinking so much of that. I'm thinking of any that she\r\n",
      "herself may be still in a position to pick up. Mine now, don't you\r\n",
      "see? is in making out how I can manage for this. Of course it's rather\r\n",
      "difficult,\" the girl pursued, \"for me to tell you exactly what I mean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but it isn't a bit difficult for me to understand you!\" Vanderbank\r\n",
      "spoke, in his geniality, as if this were in fact the veriest trifle.\r\n",
      "\"You've got your mother on your mind. That's very much what I mean by\r\n",
      "your conscience.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda had a fresh hesitation, but evidently unaccompanied at present\r\n",
      "by any pain. \"Don't you still LIKE mamma?\" she at any rate quite\r\n",
      "successfully brought out. \"I must tell you,\" she quickly subjoined,\r\n",
      "\"that though I've mentioned my talk with her as having finally led to my\r\n",
      "writing to you, it isn't in the least that she then suggested my putting\r\n",
      "you the question. I put it,\" she explained, \"quite off my own bat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The explanation, as an effect immediately produced, did proportionately\r\n",
      "much for the visitor, who sat back in his chair with a pleased--a\r\n",
      "distinctly exhilarated--sense both of what he himself and what Nanda had\r\n",
      "done. \"You're an adorable family!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then if mother's adorable why give her up? This I don't mind\r\n",
      "admitting she did, the day I speak of, let me see that she feels you've\r\n",
      "done; but without suggesting either--not a scrap, please believe--that I\r\n",
      "should make you any sort of scene about it. Of course in the first place\r\n",
      "she knows perfectly that anything like a scene would be no use. You\r\n",
      "couldn't make out even if you wanted,\" Nanda went on, \"that THIS is one.\r\n",
      "She won't hear us--will she?--smashing the furniture. I didn't think for\r\n",
      "a while that I could do anything at all, and I worried myself with that\r\n",
      "idea half to death. Then suddenly it came to me that I could do just\r\n",
      "what I'm doing now. You said a while ago that we must never be--you\r\n",
      "and I--anything but frank and natural. That's what I said to myself\r\n",
      "also--why not? Here I am for you therefore as natural as a cold in\r\n",
      "your head. I just ask you--I even press you. It's because, as she said,\r\n",
      "you've practically ceased coming. Of course I know everything changes.\r\n",
      "It's the law--what is it?--'the great law' of something or other. All\r\n",
      "sorts of things happen--things come to an end. She has more or less--by\r\n",
      "his marriage--lost Mitchy. I don't want her to lose everything. Do stick\r\n",
      "to her. What I really wanted to say to you--to bring it straight out--is\r\n",
      "that I don't believe you thoroughly know how awfully she likes you. I\r\n",
      "hope my saying such a thing doesn't affect you as 'immodest.' One never\r\n",
      "knows--but I don't much care if it does. I suppose it WOULD be immodest\r\n",
      "if I were to say that I verily believe she's in love with you. Not, for\r\n",
      "that matter, that father would mind--he wouldn't mind, as he says, a\r\n",
      "tuppenny rap. So\"--she extraordinarily kept it up--\"you're welcome to\r\n",
      "any good the information may have for you: though that, I dare say, does\r\n",
      "sound hideous. No matter--if I produce any effect on you. That's\r\n",
      "the only thing I want. When I think of her downstairs there so often\r\n",
      "nowadays practically alone I feel as if I could scarcely bear it. She's\r\n",
      "so fearfully young.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time at least her speech, while she went from point to point,\r\n",
      "completely hushed him, though after a full glimpse of the direction it\r\n",
      "was taking he ceased to meet her eyes and only sat staring hard at the\r\n",
      "pattern of the rug. Even when at last he spoke it was without looking\r\n",
      "up. \"You're indeed, as she herself used to say, the modern daughter! It\r\n",
      "takes that type to wish to make a career for her parents.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Nanda very simply, \"it isn't a 'career' exactly, is\r\n",
      "it--keeping hold of an old friend? but it may console a little, mayn't\r\n",
      "it, for the absence of one? At all events I didn't want not to have\r\n",
      "spoken before it's too late. Of course I don't know what's the matter\r\n",
      "between you, or if anything's really the matter at all. I don't care\r\n",
      "at any rate WHAT is--it can't be anything very bad. Make it up, make it\r\n",
      "up--forget it. I don't pretend that's a career for YOU any more than for\r\n",
      "her; but there it is. I know how I sound--most patronising and pushing;\r\n",
      "but nothing venture nothing have. You CAN'T know how much you are to\r\n",
      "her. You're more to her, I verily believe, than any one EVER was. I hate\r\n",
      "to have the appearance of plotting anything about her behind her back;\r\n",
      "so I'll just say it once for all. She said once, in speaking of it to\r\n",
      "a person who repeated it to me, that you had done more for her than any\r\n",
      "one, because it was you who had really brought her out. It WAS. You\r\n",
      "did. I saw it at the time myself. I was very small, but I COULD see it.\r\n",
      "You'll say I must have been a most uncanny little wretch, and I dare\r\n",
      "say I was and am keeping now the pleasant promise. That doesn't prevent\r\n",
      "one's feeling that when a person has brought a person out--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A person should take the consequences,\" Vanderbank broke in, \"and see a\r\n",
      "person through?\" He could meet her now perfectly and proceeded admirably\r\n",
      "to do it. \"There's an immense deal in that, I admit--I admit. I'm bound\r\n",
      "to say I don't know quite what I did--one does those things, no doubt,\r\n",
      "with a fine unconsciousness: I should have thought indeed it was the\r\n",
      "other way round. But I assure you I accept all consequences and all\r\n",
      "responsibilities. If you don't know what's the matter between us I'm\r\n",
      "sure _I_ don't either. It can't be much--we'll look into it. I don't\r\n",
      "mean you and I--YOU mustn't be any more worried; but she and her\r\n",
      "so unwittingly faithless one. I HAVEN'T been as often, I know\"--Van\r\n",
      "pleasantly kept his course. \"But there's a tide in the affairs of\r\n",
      "men--and of women too, and of girls and of every one. You know what I\r\n",
      "mean--you know it for yourself. The great thing is that--bless both your\r\n",
      "hearts!--one doesn't, one simply CAN'T if one would, give your mother\r\n",
      "up. It's absurd to talk about it. Nobody ever did such a thing in his\r\n",
      "life. There she is, like the moon or the Marble Arch. I don't say, mind\r\n",
      "you,\" he candidly explained, \"that every one LIKES her equally: that's\r\n",
      "another affair. But no one who ever HAS liked her can afford ever\r\n",
      "again for any long period to do without her. There are too many stupid\r\n",
      "people--there's too much dull company. That, in London, is to be had by\r\n",
      "the ton; your mother's intelligence, on the other hand, will always have\r\n",
      "its price. One can talk with her for a change. She's fine, fine, fine.\r\n",
      "So, my dear child, be quiet. She's a fixed star.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know she is,\" Nanda said. \"It's YOU--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who may be only the flashing meteor?\" He sat and smiled at her. \"I\r\n",
      "promise you then that your words have stayed me in my course. You've\r\n",
      "made me stand as still as Joshua made the sun.\" With which he got\r\n",
      "straight up. \"'Young,' you say she is?\"--for as if to make up for it\r\n",
      "he all the more sociably continued. \"It's not like anything else. She's\r\n",
      "youth. She's MY youth--she WAS mine. And if you ever have a chance,\"\r\n",
      "he wound up, \"do put in for me that if she wants REALLY to know she's\r\n",
      "booked for my old age. She's clever enough, you know\"--and Vanderbank,\r\n",
      "laughing, went over for his hat--\"to understand what you tell her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda took this in with due attention; she was also now on her feet.\r\n",
      "\"And then she's so lovely.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Awfully pretty!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't say it, as they say, you know,\" the girl continued, \"BECAUSE\r\n",
      "she's mother, but I often think when we're out that wherever she is--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's no one that all round really touches her?\" Vanderbank took it\r\n",
      "up with zeal. \"Oh so every one thinks, and in fact one's appreciation\r\n",
      "of the charming things in that way so intensely her own can scarcely\r\n",
      "breathe on them all lightly enough. And then, hang it, she has\r\n",
      "perceptions--which are not things that run about the streets. She has\r\n",
      "surprises.\" He almost broke down for vividness. \"She has little ways.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'm glad you do like her,\" Nanda gravely replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this again he fairly faced her, his momentary silence making it still\r\n",
      "more direct. \"I like, you know, about as well as I ever liked anything,\r\n",
      "this wonderful idea of yours of putting in a plea for her solitude\r\n",
      "and her youth. Don't think I do it injustice if I say--which is saying\r\n",
      "much--that it's quite as charming as it's amusing. And now good-bye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had put out his hand, but Nanda hesitated. \"You won't wait for tea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child, I can't.\" He seemed to feel, however, that something\r\n",
      "more must be said. \"We shall meet again. But it's getting on, isn't it,\r\n",
      "toward the general scatter?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and I hope that this year,\" she answered, \"you'll have a good\r\n",
      "holiday.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh we shall meet before that. I shall do what I can, but upon my word\r\n",
      "I feel, you know,\" he laughed, \"that such a tuning-up as YOU'VE given me\r\n",
      "will last me a long time. It's like the high Alps.\" Then with his hand\r\n",
      "out again he added: \"Have you any plans yourself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So many, it might have seemed, that she had no time to take for thinking\r\n",
      "of them. \"I dare say I shall be away a good deal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He candidly wondered. \"With Mr. Longdon?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--with him most.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had another pause. \"Really for a long time?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A long long one, I hope.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your mother's willing again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh perfectly. And you see that's why.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\" She had said nothing more, and he failed to understand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why you mustn't too much leave her alone. DON'T!\" Nanda brought out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I won't. But,\" he presently added, \"there are one or two things.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what are they?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He produced in some seriousness the first. \"Won't she after all see the\r\n",
      "Mitchys?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not so much either. That of course is now very different.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vanderbank demurred. \"But not for YOU, I gather--is it? Don't you expect\r\n",
      "to see them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--I hope they'll come down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved away a little--not straight to the door. \"To Beccles? Funny\r\n",
      "place for them, a little though, isn't it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had put the question as if for amusement, but Nanda took it\r\n",
      "literally. \"Ah not when they're invited so very very charmingly. Not\r\n",
      "when he wants them so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Longdon? Then that keeps up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'That'?\"--she was at a loss.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean his intimacy--with Mitchy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So far as it IS an intimacy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But didn't you, by the way\"--and he looked again at his watch--\"tell me\r\n",
      "they're just about to turn up together?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh not so very particularly together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mitchy first alone?\" Vanderbank asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had a smile that was dim, that was slightly strange. \"Unless you'll\r\n",
      "stay for company.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thanks--impossible. And then Mr. Longdon alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Unless Mitchy stays.\"\r\n",

      "of these episodes an odd resemblance between the manner and all the\r\n",
      "movements that had followed his entrance and those that had accompanied\r\n",
      "the installation of his predecessor. He laid his hat, as Vanderbank had\r\n",
      "done, in three places in succession and appeared to question scarcely\r\n",
      "less the safety, somewhere, of his umbrella and the grace of retaining\r\n",
      "in his hand his gloves. He postponed the final selection of a seat and\r\n",

      "at photographs, he took up a book or two as Vanderbank had done, and for\r\n",
      "a couple of minutes there was silence between them. \"What does stretch\r\n",
      "before me,\" he resumed after an interval during which clearly, in spite\r\n",
      "of his movements, he had looked at nothing--\"what does stretch before me\r\n",
      "is the happy prospect of my feeling that I've found in you a friend\r\n",
      "with whom, so utterly and unreservedly, I can always go to the bottom\r\n",
      "of things. This luxury, you see now, of our freedom to look facts in the\r\n",

      "which she never yet HAS been,\" he continued, \"what will the whole thing\r\n",
      "be but a practical multiplication of our points of contact? You may\r\n",
      "remind me of Mrs. Brook's contention that if she did in her time keep\r\n",

      "a collection of fortuitous atoms; but that, my dear Nanda, will become\r\n",
      "none the less, to your clearer sense, but a pious echo of her momentary\r\n",
      "modesty or--call it at the worst--her momentary despair. The generations\r\n",
      "will come and go, and the PERSONNEL, as the newspapers say, of the\r\n",

      "do. WE shan't last, but your mother will, and as Aggie is happily very\r\n",
      "young she's therefore provided for, in the time to come, on a scale\r\n",
      "sufficiently considerable to leave us just now at peace. Meanwhile,\r\n",
      "as you're almost as good for husbands as Mrs. Brook is for wives, why\r\n",
      "aren't we, as a couple, we Mitchys, quite ideally arranged for, and why\r\n",
      "mayn't I speak to you of my future as sufficiently guaranteed? The only\r\n",
      "appreciable shadow I make out comes, for me, from the question of what\r\n",
      "may to-day be between you and Mr. Longdon. Do I understand,\" Mitchy\r\n",
      "asked, \"that he's presently to arrive for an answer to something he has\r\n",
      "put to you?\" Nanda looked at him a while with a sort of solemnity of\r\n",
      "tenderness, and her voice, when she at last spoke, trembled with a\r\n",
      "feeling that clearly had grown in her as she listened to the string of\r\n",
      "whimsicalities, bitter and sweet, that he had just unrolled. \"You're\r\n",
      "wild,\" she said simply--\"you're wild.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wonderfully glared. \"Am I then already frightening you?\" He shook his\r\n",
      "head rather sadly. \"I'm not in the least trying yet. There's something,\"\r\n",
      "he added after an instant, \"that I do want too awfully to ask you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then--!\" If she had not eagerness she had at least charity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but you see I reflect that though you show all the courage to go\r\n",
      "to the roots and depths with ME, I'm not--I never have been--fully\r\n",
      "conscious of the nerve for doing as much with you. It's a question,\"\r\n",
      "Mitchy explained, \"of how much--of a particular matter--you know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She continued ever so kindly to face him. \"Hasn't it come out all round\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her reply, in this form, took a minute or two to operate, but when it\r\n",
      "began to do so it fairly diffused a light. Mitchy's face turned of a\r\n",
      "colour that might have been produced by her holding close to it some\r\n",
      "lantern wonderfully glazed. \"You know, you know!\" he then rang out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I know.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "fancy does move you, to clear out. You clear out--you make all sorts of\r\n",

      "the depths! I look all round and see every one squared and every one but\r\n",
      "one or two suited. Why then reflexion and delay?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't, dear Mr. Mitchy,\" Nanda took her time to return, \"know\r\n",
      "nearly as much as you think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But isn't my question absolutely a confession of ignorance and a\r\n",

      "you may yet feel, you imply, proceeds from a sense of duties in London\r\n",

      "my neck-tie; which incidentally means, by the way, that if you should\r\n",
      "admire it you're quite welcome to it. Such words--that's my point--are\r\n",
      "like such jewels: the pride, you see, of one's heart. They're mere\r\n",

      "interested--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In MY interests? Of course--since he has gone so far. You expressed\r\n",

      "further he WILL go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Yes--very much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "suppressed sound and said, while he watched her, nothing else, \"It's no\r\n",

      "\"Why I get the benefit of the fact that there was never a time when I\r\n",
      "didn't know SOMETHING or other, and that I became more and more aware,\r\n",
      "as I grew older, of a hundred little chinks of daylight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mitchy stared. \"You're stupendous, my dear!\" he murmured.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"That she didn't even suspect herself,\" Nanda broke in, \"to be? I'm\r\n",

      "much more of it. More HAS come--and more will yet. You see, when there\r\n",
      "has been nothing before, it all has to come with a rush. So that if even\r\n",
      "I'm surprised of course she is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And of course _I_ am!\" Mitchy's interest, though even now not wholly\r\n",
      "unqualified with amusement, had visibly deepened. \"You admit then,\" he\r\n",
      "continued, \"that you're surprised?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda just hesitated. \"At the mere scale of it. I think it's splendid.\r\n",

      "to be helpful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Toward Aggie's finding herself. Do you think,\" she immediately\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't mind if you stand on your head--at the pass we've come to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall not try your patience,\" the girl good-humouredly replied,\r\n",
      "\"so far as that. I only want you not to be worried if I walk about a\r\n",
      "little.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, without a movement, kept his posture. \"Oh I can't oblige\r\n",
      "you there. I SHALL be worried. I've come on purpose to be worried, and\r\n",
      "the more I surrender myself to the rack the more, I seem to feel, we\r\n",
      "shall have threshed our business out. So you may dance, you may stamp,\r\n",
      "if you like, on the absolutely passive thing you've made of me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what I HAVE had from Mitchy,\" she cheerfully responded, \"is\r\n",
      "practically a lesson in dancing: by which I perhaps mean rather a lesson\r\n",
      "in sitting, myself, as I want you to do while _I_ talk, as still as\r\n",
      "a mouse. They take,\" she declared, \"while THEY talk, an amount of\r\n",
      "exercise!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Oh no--before, alone. All over the place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon had a pause so rich in appeal that when he at last spoke his\r\n",
      "question was itself like an answer. \"Mr. Van has been to see you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. I wrote and asked him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But don't get up.\" She raised her hand. \"Don't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why should I?\" He had never budged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He was most kind; stayed half an hour and, when I told him you were\r\n",
      "coming, left a good message for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"To make what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, that he has not, for so long, been to see you or written to you.\r\n",
      "That he has seemed to neglect you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda's visitor looked so far about as to take the neighbourhood in\r\n",
      "general into the confidence of his surprise. \"To neglect ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, others too, I believe--with whom we're not concerned. He has been\r\n",
      "so taken up. But you above all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon showed on this a coldness that somehow spoke for itself as\r\n",
      "the greatest with which he had ever in his life met an act of reparation\r\n",
      "and that was infinitely confirmed by his sustained immobility. \"But of\r\n",
      "what have I complained?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't think he fancies you've complained.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And how could he have come to see me,\" he continued, \"when for so many\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was not more ready with objections, however, than his companion had\r\n",
      "by this time become with answers. \"He must have been thinking of the\r\n",
      "time of your present stay. He evidently has you much on his mind--he\r\n",
      "spoke of not having seen you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has quite sufficiently tried--he has left cards,\" Mr. Longdon\r\n",
      "returned. \"What more does he want?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda looked at him with her long grave straight-ness, which had often a\r\n",
      "play of light beyond any smile. \"Oh, you know, he does want more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then it was open to him--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So he so strongly feels\"--she quickly took him up--\"that you must have\r\n",
      "felt. And therefore it is I speak for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't!\" said Mr. Longdon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I promised him I would.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't!\" her friend repeated as in stifled pain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had kept for the time all her fine clearness turned to him; but\r\n",
      "she might on this have been taken as giving him up with a movement of\r\n",
      "obedience and a strange soft sigh. The smothered sound might even have\r\n",
      "represented to a listener at all initiated a consenting retreat before\r\n",
      "an effort greater than her reckoning--a retreat that was in so far the\r\n",
      "snap of a sharp tension. The next minute, none the less, she evidently\r\n",
      "found a fresh provocation in the sight of the pale and positively\r\n",
      "excessive rigour she had imposed, so that, though her friend was only\r\n",
      "accommodating himself to her wish she had a sudden impulse of criticism.\r\n",
      "\"You're proud about it--too proud!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what if I am?\" He looked at her with a complexity of\r\n",
      "communication that no words could have meddled with. \"Pride's all right\r\n",
      "when it helps one to bear things.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Nanda, \"but that's only when one wants to take the least from\r\n",
      "them. When one wants to take the most--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\"--he spoke, as she faltered, with a certain small hardness of\r\n",
      "interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She faltered, however, indeed. \"Oh I don't know how to say it.\" She\r\n",
      "fairly coloured with the attempt. \"One must let the sense of all that I\r\n",
      "speak of--well, all come. One must rather like it. I don't know--but I\r\n",
      "suppose one must rather grovel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon, though with visible reluctance, turned it over. \"That's\r\n",
      "very fine--but you're a woman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--that must make a difference. But being a woman, in such a case,\r\n",
      "has then,\" Nanda went on, \"its advantages.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this point perhaps her friend might presently have been taken as\r\n",
      "relaxing. \"It strikes me that even at that the advantages are mainly for\r\n",
      "others. I'm glad, God knows, that you're not also a young man.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then we're suited all round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had spoken with a promptitude that appeared again to act on him\r\n",
      "slightly as an irritant, for he met it--with more delay--by a long and\r\n",
      "derisive murmur. \"Oh MY pride--!\" But this she in no manner took up;\r\n",
      "so that he was left for a little to his thoughts. \"That's what you were\r\n",
      "plotting when you told me the other day that you wanted time?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah I wasn't plotting--though I was, I confess, trying to work things\r\n",
      "out. That particular idea of simply asking Mr. Van by letter to present\r\n",
      "himself--that particular flight of fancy hadn't in fact then at all\r\n",
      "occurred to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It never occurred, I'm bound to say, to ME,\" said Mr. Longdon. \"I've\r\n",
      "never thought of writing to him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very good. But you haven't the reasons. I wanted to attack him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not about me, I hope to God!\" Mr. Longdon, distinctly a little paler,\r\n",
      "rejoined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid. I think I had an instinct of how you would have taken\r\n",
      "THAT. It was about mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said her visitor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has been worse to her than to you,\" she continued. \"But he'll make\r\n",
      "it all right.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon's attention retained its grimness. \"If he has such a remedy\r\n",
      "for the more then, what has he for the less?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nanda, however, was but for an instant checked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh it's I who make it up to YOU. To mother, you see, there's no one\r\n",
      "otherwise to make it up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This at first unmistakeably sounded to him too complicated for\r\n",
      "acceptance. But his face changed as light dawned. \"That puts it then\r\n",
      "that you WILL come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll come if you'll take me as I am--which is what I must previously\r\n",
      "explain to you: I mean more than I've ever done before. But what HE\r\n",
      "means by what you call his remedy is my making you feel better about\r\n",
      "himself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man gazed at her. \"'Your' doing it is too beautiful! And he\r\n",
      "could really come to you for the purpose of asking you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no,\" said the girl briskly, \"he came simply for the purpose of doing\r\n",
      "what he HAD to do. After my letter how could he not come? Then he met\r\n",
      "most kindly what I said to him for mother and what he quite understood\r\n",
      "to be all my business with him; so that his appeal to me to plead with\r\n",
      "you for--well, for his credit--was only thrown in because he had so good\r\n",
      "a chance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This speech brought Mr. Longdon abruptly to his feet, but before she\r\n",
      "could warn him again of the patience she continued to need he had\r\n",
      "already, as if what she evoked for him left him too stupefied, dropped\r\n",
      "back into submission. \"The man stood there for you to render him a\r\n",
      "service?--for you to help him and praise him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but it wasn't to go out of my way, don't you see? He knew you were\r\n",
      "presently to be here.\" Her anxiety that he should understand gave her a\r\n",
      "rare strained smile. \"I mustn't make--as a request from him--too much of\r\n",
      "it, and I've not a doubt that, rather than that you should think any\r\n",
      "ill of him for wishing me to say a word, he would gladly be left with\r\n",
      "whatever bad appearance he may actually happen to have.\" She pulled\r\n",
      "up on these words as with a quick sense of their really, by their mere\r\n",
      "sound, putting her in deeper; and could only give her friend one of the\r\n",
      "looks that expressed: \"If I could trust you not to assent even more than\r\n",
      "I want, I should say 'You know what I mean!'\" She allowed him at all\r\n",
      "events--or tried to allow him--no time for uttered irony before going\r\n",
      "on: \"He was everything you could have wished; quite as beautiful about\r\n",
      "YOU--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As about you?\"--Mr. Longdon took her up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She demurred. \"As about mother.\" With which she turned away as if it\r\n",
      "handsomely settled the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it only left him, as she went to the window, sitting there sombre.\r\n",
      "\"I like, you know,\" he brought out as his eyes followed her, \"your\r\n",
      "saying you're not proud! Thank God you ARE, my dear. Yes--it's better\r\n",
      "for us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this, after a moment, in her place, she turned round to him. \"I'm\r\n",
      "glad I'm anything--whatever you may call it and though I can't call it\r\n",
      "the same--that's good for YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He said nothing more for a little, as if by such a speech something in\r\n",
      "him were simplified and softened. \"It would be good for me--by which I\r\n",
      "mean it would be easier for me--if you didn't quite so immensely care\r\n",
      "for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" came from Nanda with an accent of attenuation at once so\r\n",
      "precipitate and so vague that it only made her attitude at first rather\r\n",
      "awkward. \"Oh!\" she immediately repeated, but with an increase of the\r\n",
      "same effect. After which, conscious, she made, as if to save herself, a\r\n",
      "quick addition. \"Dear Mr. Longdon, isn't it rather yourself most--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It would be easier for me,\" he went on, heedless, \"if you didn't, my\r\n",
      "poor child, so wonderfully love him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but I don't--please believe me when I assure you I DON'T!\" she broke\r\n",
      "out. It burst from her, flaring up, in a queer quaver that ended in\r\n",
      "something queerer still--in her abrupt collapse, on the spot, into the\r\n",
      "nearest chair, where she choked with a torrent of tears. Her buried face\r\n",
      "could only after a moment give way to the flood, and she sobbed in a\r\n",
      "passion as sharp and brief as the flurry of a wild thing for an instant\r\n",
      "uncaged; her old friend meantime keeping his place in the silence broken\r\n",
      "by her sound and distantly--across the room--closing his eyes to his\r\n",
      "helplessness and her shame. Thus they sat together while their trouble\r\n",
      "both conjoined and divided them. She recovered herself, however, with an\r\n",
      "effort worthy of her fall and was on her feet again as she stammeringly\r\n",
      "spoke and angrily brushed at her eyes. \"What difference in the world\r\n",
      "does it make--what difference ever?\" Then clearly, even with the words,\r\n",
      "her checked tears suffered her to see how it made the difference that he\r\n",
      "too had been crying; so that \"I don't know why you mind!\" she thereupon\r\n",
      "wailed with extravagance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't know what I would have done for him. You don't know,\r\n",
      "you don't know!\" he repeated--while she looked as if she naturally\r\n",
      "couldn't--as with a renewal of his dream of beneficence and of the\r\n",
      "soreness of his personal wound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, but HE does you justice--he knows. So it shows, so it shows--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in this direction too, unable to say what it showed, she had again\r\n",
      "broken down and again could only hold herself and let her companion sit\r\n",
      "there. \"Ah Nanda, Nanda!\" he deeply murmured; and the depth of the pity\r\n",
      "was, vainly and blindly, as the depth of a reproach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's I--it's I, therefore,\" she said as if she must then so look at it\r\n",
      "with him; \"it's I who am the horrible impossible and who have covered\r\n",
      "everything else with my own impossibility. For some different person you\r\n",
      "COULD have done what you speak of, and for some different person you can\r\n",
      "do it still.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stared at her with his barren sorrow. \"A person different from him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A person different from ME!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what interest have I in any such person?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But your interest in me--you see well enough where THAT lands us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Longdon now got to his feet and somewhat stiffly remained; after\r\n",
      "which, for all answer, \"You say you WILL come then?\" he asked. Then\r\n",
      "as--seemingly with her last thought--she kept silent: \"You understand\r\n",
      "clearly, I take it, that this time it's never again to leave me--or to\r\n",
      "BE left.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I understand,\" she presently replied. \"Never again. That,\" she\r\n",
      "continued, \"is why I asked you for these days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, since you've taken them--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but have YOU?\" said Nanda. They were close to each other now, and\r\n",
      "with a tenderness of warning that was helped by their almost equal\r\n",
      "stature she laid her hand on his shoulder. \"What I did more than\r\n",
      "anything else write to him for,\" she had now regained her clearness\r\n",
      "enough to explain, \"was that--with whatever idea you had--you should see\r\n",
      "for yourself how he could come and go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what good was that to do me? HADN'T I seen for myself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--you've seen once more. Here he was. I didn't care what he\r\n",
      "thought. Here I brought him. And his reasons remain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She kept her eyes on her companion's face, but his own now and\r\n",
      "afterwards seemed to wander far. \"What do I care for his reasons so long\r\n",
      "as they're not mine?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought an instant, still holding him gently and as if for\r\n",
      "successful argument. \"But perhaps you don't altogether understand them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why the devil, altogether, SHOULD I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah because you distinctly want to,\" said Nanda ever so kindly. \"You've\r\n",
      "admitted as much when we've talked--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but when HAVE we talked?\" he sharply interrupted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time he had challenged her so straight that it was her own look\r\n",
      "that strayed. \"When?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She hesitated. \"When HAVEN'T we?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, YOU may have: if that's what you call talking--never saying a\r\n",
      "word. But I haven't. I've only to do at any rate, in the way of reasons,\r\n",
      "with my own.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yours too then remain? Because, you know,\" the girl pursued, \"I AM\r\n",
      "like that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like what he thinks.\" Then so gravely that it was almost a\r\n",
      "supplication, \"Don't tell me,\" she added, \"that you don't KNOW what he\r\n",
      "thinks. You do know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their eyes, on that strange ground, could meet at last, and the effect\r\n",
      "of it was presently for Mr. Longdon. \"I do know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well!\" He raised his hands and took her face, which he drew so close to\r\n",
      "his own that, as she gently let him, he could kiss her with solemnity\r\n",
      "on the forehead. \"Come!\" he then very firmly said--quite indeed as if it\r\n",
      "were a question of their moving on the spot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It literally made her smile, which, with a certain compunction, she\r\n",
      "immediately corrected by doing for him in the pressure of her lips\r\n",
      "to his cheek what he had just done for herself. \"To-day?\" she more\r\n",
      "seriously asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at his watch. \"To-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She paused, but clearly for assent. \"That's what I mean by your taking\r\n",
      "me as I am. It IS, you know, for a girl--extraordinary.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know what it is!\" he exclaimed with an odd fatigue in his\r\n",
      "tenderness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she continued, with the shadow of her scruple, to explain. \"We're\r\n",
      "many of us, we're most of us--as you long ago saw and showed you\r\n",

      "The litigation seemed interminable and had in fact been complicated; but\r\n",
      "by the decision on the appeal the judgement of the divorce-court was\r\n",
      "confirmed as to the assignment of the child. The father, who, though\r\n",
      "bespattered from head to foot, had made good his case, was, in pursuance\r\n",
      "of this triumph, appointed to keep her: it was not so much that the\r\n",
      "mother's character had been more absolutely damaged as that the\r\n",
      "brilliancy of a lady's complexion (and this lady's, in court, was\r\n",
      "immensely remarked) might be more regarded as showing the spots.\r\n",
      "Attached, however, to the second pronouncement was a condition that\r\n",
      "detracted, for Beale Farange, from its sweetness--an order that he\r\n",
      "should refund to his late wife the twenty-six hundred pounds put down\r\n",
      "by her, as it was called, some three years before, in the interest of\r\n",
      "the child's maintenance and precisely on a proved understanding that he\r\n",
      "would take no proceedings: a sum of which he had had the administration\r\n",
      "and of which he could render not the least account. The obligation thus\r\n",
      "attributed to her adversary was no small balm to Ida's resentment; it\r\n",
      "drew a part of the sting from her defeat and compelled Mr. Farange\r\n",
      "perceptibly to lower his crest. He was unable to produce the money or to\r\n",
      "raise it in any way; so that after a squabble scarcely less public and\r\n",
      "scarcely more decent than the original shock of battle his only issue\r\n",
      "from his predicament was a compromise proposed by his legal advisers and\r\n",
      "finally accepted by hers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His debt was by this arrangement remitted to him and the little girl\r\n",
      "disposed of in a manner worthy of the judgement-seat of Solomon. She was\r\n",
      "divided in two and the portions tossed impartially to the disputants.\r\n",
      "They would take her, in rotation, for six months at a time; she would\r\n",
      "spend half the year with each. This was odd justice in the eyes of those\r\n",
      "who still blinked in the fierce light projected from the tribunal--a\r\n",
      "light in which neither parent figured in the least as a happy example to\r\n",
      "youth and innocence. What was to have been expected on the evidence was\r\n",
      "the nomination, _in loco parentis_, of some proper third person, some\r\n",
      "respectable or at least some presentable friend. Apparently, however,\r\n",
      "the circle of the Faranges had been scanned in vain for any such\r\n",
      "ornament; so that the only solution finally meeting all the difficulties\r\n",
      "was, save that of sending Maisie to a Home, the partition of the\r\n",
      "tutelary office in the manner I have mentioned. There were more reasons\r\n",
      "for her parents to agree to it than there had ever been for them to\r\n",
      "agree to anything; and they now prepared with her help to enjoy the\r\n",
      "distinction that waits upon vulgarity sufficiently attested. Their\r\n",
      "rupture had resounded, and after being perfectly insignificant\r\n",
      "together they would be decidedly striking apart. Had they not produced\r\n",
      "an impression that warranted people in looking for appeals in the\r\n",
      "newspapers for the rescue of the little one--reverberation, amid a\r\n",
      "vociferous public, of the idea that some movement should be started or\r\n",
      "some benevolent person should come forward? A good lady came indeed a\r\n",
      "step or two: she was distantly related to Mrs. Farange, to whom she\r\n",
      "proposed that, having children and nurseries wound up and going, she\r\n",
      "should be allowed to take home the bone of contention and, by working it\r\n",
      "into her system, relieve at least one of the parents. This would make\r\n",
      "every time, for Maisie, after her inevitable six months with Beale, much\r\n",
      "more of a change.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"More of a change?\" Ida cried. \"Won't it be enough of a change for her\r\n",
      "to come from that low brute to the person in the world who detests him\r\n",
      "most?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, because you detest him so much that you'll always talk to her about\r\n",
      "him. You'll keep him before her by perpetually abusing him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Farange stared. \"Pray, then, am I to do nothing to counteract his\r\n",
      "villainous abuse of ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The good lady, for a moment, made no reply: her silence was a grim\r\n",
      "judgement of the whole point of view. \"Poor little monkey!\" she at\r\n",
      "last exclaimed; and the words were an epitaph for the tomb of Maisie's\r\n",
      "childhood. She was abandoned to her fate. What was clear to any\r\n",
      "spectator was that the only link binding her to either parent was this\r\n",
      "lamentable fact of her being a ready vessel for bitterness, a deep\r\n",
      "little porcelain cup in which biting acids could be mixed. They had\r\n",
      "wanted her not for any good they could do her, but for the harm they\r\n",
      "could, with her unconscious aid, do each other. She should serve\r\n",
      "their anger and seal their revenge, for husband and wife had been\r\n",
      "alike crippled by the heavy hand of justice, which in the last resort\r\n",
      "met on neither side their indignant claim to get, as they called it,\r\n",
      "everything. If each was only to get half this seemed to concede that\r\n",
      "neither was so base as the other pretended, or, to put it differently,\r\n",
      "offered them both as bad indeed, since they were only as good as each\r\n",
      "other. The mother had wished to prevent the father from, as she said,\r\n",
      "\"so much as looking\" at the child; the father's plea was that the\r\n",
      "mother's lightest touch was \"simply contamination.\" These were the\r\n",
      "opposed principles in which Maisie was to be educated--she was to fit\r\n",
      "them together as she might. Nothing could have been more touching at\r\n",
      "first than her failure to suspect the ordeal that awaited her little\r\n",
      "unspotted soul. There were persons horrified to think what those in\r\n",
      "charge of it would combine to try to make of it: no one could conceive\r\n",
      "in advance that they would be able to make nothing ill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a society in which for the most part people were occupied\r\n",
      "only with chatter, but the disunited couple had at last grounds for\r\n",
      "expecting a time of high activity. They girded their loins, they felt\r\n",
      "as if the quarrel had only begun. They felt indeed more married than\r\n",
      "ever, inasmuch as what marriage had mainly suggested to them was the\r\n",
      "unbroken opportunity to quarrel. There had been \"sides\" before, and\r\n",
      "there were sides as much as ever; for the sider too the prospect\r\n",
      "opened out, taking the pleasant form of a superabundance of matter for\r\n",
      "desultory conversation. The many friends of the Faranges drew together\r\n",
      "to differ about them; contradiction grew young again over teacups\r\n",
      "and cigars. Everybody was always assuring everybody of something\r\n",
      "very shocking, and nobody would have been jolly if nobody had been\r\n",
      "outrageous. The pair appeared to have a social attraction which failed\r\n",
      "merely as regards each other: it was indeed a great deal to be able\r\n",
      "to say for Ida that no one but Beale desired her blood, and for Beale\r\n",
      "that if he should ever have his eyes scratched out it would be only by\r\n",
      "his wife. It was generally felt, to begin with, that they were awfully\r\n",
      "good-looking--they had really not been analysed to a deeper residuum.\r\n",
      "They made up together for instance some twelve feet three of stature,\r\n",
      "and nothing was more discussed than the apportionment of this\r\n",
      "quantity. The sole flaw in Ida's beauty was a length and reach of\r\n",
      "arm conducive perhaps to her having so often beaten her ex-husband\r\n",
      "at billiards, a game in which she showed a superiority largely\r\n",
      "accountable, as she maintained, for the resentment finding expression\r\n",
      "in his physical violence. Billiards was her great accomplishment\r\n",
      "and the distinction her name always first produced the mention of.\r\n",
      "Notwithstanding some very long lines everything about her that might\r\n",
      "have been large and that in many women profited by the licence was,\r\n",
      "with a single exception, admired and cited for its smallness. The\r\n",
      "exception was her eyes, which might have been of mere regulation size,\r\n",
      "but which overstepped the modesty of nature; her mouth, on the other\r\n",
      "hand, was barely perceptible, and odds were freely taken as to the\r\n",
      "measurement of her waist. She was a person who, when she was out--and\r\n",
      "she was always out--produced everywhere a sense of having been seen\r\n",
      "often, the sense indeed of a kind of abuse of visibility, so that it\r\n",
      "would have been, in the usual places rather vulgar to wonder at her.\r\n",
      "Strangers only did that; but they, to the amusement of the familiar,\r\n",
      "did it very much: it was an inevitable way of betraying an alien\r\n",
      "habit. Like her husband she carried clothes, carried them as a train\r\n",
      "carries passengers: people had been known to compare their taste and\r\n",
      "dispute about the accommodation they gave these articles, though\r\n",
      "inclining on the whole to the commendation of Ida as less overcrowded,\r\n",
      "especially with jewellery and flowers. Beale Farange had natural\r\n",
      "decorations, a kind of costume in his vast fair beard, burnished like\r\n",
      "a gold breastplate, and in the eternal glitter of the teeth that his\r\n",
      "long moustache had been trained not to hide and that gave him, in\r\n",
      "every possible situation, the look of the joy of life. He had been\r\n",
      "destined in his youth for diplomacy and momentarily attached, without\r\n",
      "a salary, to a legation which enabled him often to say \"In MY time in\r\n",
      "the East\": but contemporary history had somehow had no use for him,\r\n",
      "had hurried past him and left him in perpetual Piccadilly. Every one\r\n",
      "knew what he had--only twenty-five hundred. Poor Ida, who had run\r\n",
      "through everything, had now nothing but her carriage and her paralysed\r\n",
      "uncle. This old brute, as he was called, was supposed to have a lot\r\n",
      "put away. The child was provided for, thanks to a crafty godmother, a\r\n",

      "the effects of so great a cause. It was to be the fate of this patient\r\n",
      "little girl to see much more than she at first understood, but also even\r\n",
      "at first to understand much more than any little girl, however patient,\r\n",
      "had perhaps ever understood before. Only a drummer-boy in a ballad or\r\n",
      "a story could have been so in the thick of the fight. She was taken\r\n",
      "into the confidence of passions on which she fixed just the stare she\r\n",
      "might have had for images bounding across the wall in the slide of a\r\n",
      "magic-lantern. Her little world was phantasmagoric--strange shadows\r\n",
      "dancing on a sheet. It was as if the whole performance had been given\r\n",
      "for her--a mite of a half-scared infant in a great dim theatre. She was\r\n",
      "in short introduced to life with a liberality in which the selfishness\r\n",
      "of others found its account, and there was nothing to avert the\r\n",
      "sacrifice but the modesty of her youth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her first term was with her father, who spared her only in not letting\r\n",
      "her have the wild letters addressed to her by her mother: he confined\r\n",
      "himself to holding them up at her and shaking them, while he showed his\r\n",
      "teeth, and then amusing her by the way he chucked them, across the room,\r\n",
      "bang into the fire. Even at that moment, however, she had a scared\r\n",
      "anticipation of fatigue, a guilty sense of not rising to the occasion,\r\n",
      "feeling the charm of the violence with which the stiff unopened\r\n",
      "envelopes, whose big monograms--Ida bristled with monograms--she would\r\n",
      "have liked to see, were made to whizz, like dangerous missiles, through\r\n",
      "the air. The greatest effect of the great cause was her own greater\r\n",
      "importance, chiefly revealed to her in the larger freedom with which\r\n",
      "she was handled, pulled hither and thither and kissed, and the\r\n",
      "proportionately greater niceness she was obliged to show. Her features\r\n",
      "had somehow become prominent; they were so perpetually nipped by the\r\n",
      "gentlemen who came to see her father and the smoke of whose cigarettes\r\n",
      "went into her face. Some of these gentlemen made her strike matches and\r\n",
      "light their cigarettes; others, holding her on knees violently jolted,\r\n",
      "pinched the calves of her legs till she shrieked--her shriek was much\r\n",
      "admired--and reproached them with being toothpicks. The word stuck in\r\n",
      "her mind and contributed to her feeling from this time that she was\r\n",
      "deficient in something that would meet the general desire. She found\r\n",
      "out what it was: it was a congenital tendency to the production of a\r\n",
      "substance to which Moddle, her nurse, gave a short ugly name, a name\r\n",
      "painfully associated at dinner with the part of the joint that she\r\n",
      "didn't like. She had left behind her the time when she had no desires\r\n",
      "to meet, none at least save Moddle's, who, in Kensington Gardens, was\r\n",
      "always on the bench when she came back to see if she had been playing\r\n",
      "too far. Moddle's desire was merely that she shouldn't do that, and she\r\n",
      "met it so easily that the only spots in that long brightness were the\r\n",
      "moments of her wondering what would become of her if, on her rushing\r\n",
      "back, there should be no Moddle on the bench. They still went to the\r\n",
      "Gardens, but there was a difference even there; she was impelled\r\n",
      "perpetually to look at the legs of other children and ask her nurse if\r\n",
      "THEY were toothpicks. Moddle was terribly truthful; she always said: \"Oh\r\n",
      "my dear, you'll not find such another pair as your own.\" It seemed to\r\n",
      "have to do with something else that Moddle often said: \"You feel the\r\n",
      "strain--that's where it is; and you'll feel it still worse, you know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus from the first Maisie not only felt it, but knew she felt it. A\r\n",
      "part of it was the consequence of her father's telling her he felt it\r\n",
      "too, and telling Moddle, in her presence, that she must make a point of\r\n",
      "driving that home. She was familiar, at the age of six, with the fact\r\n",
      "that everything had been changed on her account, everything ordered to\r\n",
      "enable him to give himself up to her. She was to remember always the\r\n",
      "words in which Moddle impressed upon her that he did so give himself:\r\n",
      "\"Your papa wishes you never to forget, you know, that he has been\r\n",
      "dreadfully put about.\" If the skin on Moddle's face had to Maisie the\r\n",
      "air of being unduly, almost painfully, stretched, it never presented\r\n",
      "that appearance so much as when she uttered, as she often had occasion\r\n",
      "to utter, such words. The child wondered if they didn't make it hurt\r\n",
      "more than usual; but it was only after some time that she was able to\r\n",
      "attach to the picture of her father's sufferings, and more particularly\r\n",
      "to her nurse's manner about them, the meaning for which these things\r\n",
      "had waited. By the time she had grown sharper, as the gentlemen who had\r\n",
      "criticised her calves used to say, she found in her mind a collection of\r\n",
      "images and echoes to which meanings were attachable--images and echoes\r\n",
      "kept for her in the childish dusk, the dim closet, the high drawers,\r\n",
      "like games she wasn't yet big enough to play. The great strain meanwhile\r\n",
      "was that of carrying by the right end the things her father said about\r\n",
      "her mother--things mostly indeed that Moddle, on a glimpse of them, as\r\n",
      "if they had been complicated toys or difficult books, took out of her\r\n",
      "hands and put away in the closet. A wonderful assortment of objects of\r\n",
      "this kind she was to discover there later, all tumbled up too with the\r\n",
      "things, shuffled into the same receptacle, that her mother had said\r\n",
      "about her father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had the knowledge that on a certain occasion which every day brought\r\n",
      "nearer her mother would be at the door to take her away, and this would\r\n",
      "have darkened all the days if the ingenious Moddle hadn't written on a\r\n",
      "paper in very big easy words ever so many pleasures that she would enjoy\r\n",
      "at the other house. These promises ranged from \"a mother's fond love\"\r\n",
      "to \"a nice poached egg to your tea,\" and took by the way the prospect\r\n",
      "of sitting up ever so late to see the lady in question dressed, in\r\n",
      "silks and velvets and diamonds and pearls, to go out: so that it was a\r\n",
      "real support to Maisie, at the supreme hour, to feel how, by Moddle's\r\n",
      "direction, the paper was thrust away in her pocket and there clenched in\r\n",
      "her fist. The supreme hour was to furnish her with a vivid reminiscence,\r\n",
      "that of a strange outbreak in the drawing-room on the part of Moddle,\r\n",
      "who, in reply to something her father had just said, cried aloud: \"You\r\n",
      "ought to be perfectly ashamed of yourself--you ought to blush, sir, for\r\n",
      "the way you go on!\" The carriage, with her mother in it, was at the\r\n",
      "door; a gentleman who was there, who was always there, laughed out very\r\n",
      "loud; her father, who had her in his arms, said to Moddle: \"My dear\r\n",
      "woman, I'll settle you presently!\"--after which he repeated, showing\r\n",
      "his teeth more than ever at Maisie while he hugged her, the words for\r\n",
      "which her nurse had taken him up. Maisie was not at the moment so fully\r\n",
      "conscious of them as of the wonder of Moddle's sudden disrespect and\r\n",
      "crimson face; but she was able to produce them in the course of five\r\n",
      "minutes when, in the carriage, her mother, all kisses, ribbons, eyes,\r\n",
      "arms, strange sounds and sweet smells, said to her: \"And did your\r\n",
      "beastly papa, my precious angel, send any message to your own loving\r\n",
      "mamma?\" Then it was that she found the words spoken by her beastly papa\r\n",
      "to be, after all, in her little bewildered ears, from which, at her\r\n",
      "mother's appeal, they passed, in her clear shrill voice, straight to\r\n",
      "her little innocent lips. \"He said I was to tell you, from him,\" she\r\n",
      "faithfully reported, \"that you're a nasty horrid pig!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In that lively sense of the immediate which is the very air of a child's\r\n",
      "mind the past, on each occasion, became for her as indistinct as\r\n",
      "the future: she surrendered herself to the actual with a good faith\r\n",
      "that might have been touching to either parent. Crudely as they had\r\n",
      "calculated they were at first justified by the event: she was the little\r\n",
      "feathered shuttlecock they could fiercely keep flying between them. The\r\n",
      "evil they had the gift of thinking or pretending to think of each other\r\n",
      "they poured into her little gravely-gazing soul as into a boundless\r\n",
      "receptacle, and each of them had doubtless the best conscience in the\r\n",
      "world as to the duty of teaching her the stern truth that should be her\r\n",
      "safeguard against the other. She was at the age for which all stories\r\n",
      "are true and all conceptions are stories. The actual was the absolute,\r\n",
      "the present alone was vivid. The objurgation for instance launched\r\n",
      "in the carriage by her mother after she had at her father's bidding\r\n",
      "punctually performed was a missive that dropped into her memory with the\r\n",
      "dry rattle of a letter falling into a pillar-box. Like the letter it\r\n",
      "was, as part of the contents of a well-stuffed post-bag, delivered in\r\n",
      "due course at the right address. In the presence of these overflowings,\r\n",
      "after they had continued for a couple of years, the associates of either\r\n",
      "party sometimes felt that something should be done for what they called\r\n",
      "\"the real good, don't you know?\" of the child. The only thing done,\r\n",
      "however, in general, took place when it was sighingly remarked that she\r\n",
      "fortunately wasn't all the year round where she happened to be at the\r\n",
      "awkward moment, and that, furthermore, either from extreme cunning or\r\n",
      "from extreme stupidity, she appeared not to take things in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The theory of her stupidity, eventually embraced by her parents,\r\n",
      "corresponded with a great date in her small still life: the complete\r\n",
      "vision, private but final, of the strange office she filled. It was\r\n",
      "literally a moral revolution and accomplished in the depths of her\r\n",
      "nature. The stiff dolls on the dusky shelves began to move their arms\r\n",
      "and legs; old forms and phrases began to have a sense that frightened\r\n",
      "her. She had a new feeling, the feeling of danger; on which a new remedy\r\n",
      "rose to meet it, the idea of an inner self or, in other words, of\r\n",
      "concealment. She puzzled out with imperfect signs, but with a prodigious\r\n",
      "spirit, that she had been a centre of hatred and a messenger of insult,\r\n",
      "and that everything was bad because she had been employed to make it so.\r\n",
      "Her parted lips locked themselves with the determination to be employed\r\n",
      "no longer. She would forget everything, she would repeat nothing, and\r\n",
      "when, as a tribute to the successful application of her system, she\r\n",
      "began to be called a little idiot, she tasted a pleasure new and keen.\r\n",
      "When therefore, as she grew older, her parents in turn announced before\r\n",
      "her that she had grown shockingly dull, it was not from any real\r\n",
      "contraction of her little stream of life. She spoiled their fun, but she\r\n",
      "practically added to her own. She saw more and more; she saw too much.\r\n",
      "It was Miss Overmore, her first governess, who on a momentous occasion\r\n",
      "had sown the seeds of secrecy; sown them not by anything she said, but\r\n",
      "by a mere roll of those fine eyes which Maisie already admired. Moddle\r\n",
      "had become at this time, after alternations of residence of which the\r\n",
      "child had no clear record, an image faintly embalmed in the remembrance\r\n",
      "of hungry disappearances from the nursery and distressful lapses in the\r\n",
      "alphabet, sad embarrassments, in particular, when invited to recognise\r\n",
      "something her nurse described as \"the important letter haitch.\" Miss\r\n",
      "Overmore, however hungry, never disappeared: this marked her somehow as\r\n",
      "of higher rank, and the character was confirmed by a prettiness that\r\n",
      "Maisie supposed to be extraordinary. Mrs. Farange had described her as\r\n",
      "almost too pretty, and some one had asked what that mattered so long as\r\n",
      "Beale wasn't there. \"Beale or no Beale,\" Maisie had heard her mother\r\n",
      "reply, \"I take her because she's a lady and yet awfully poor. Rather\r\n",
      "nice people, but there are seven sisters at home. What do people mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie didn't know what people meant, but she knew very soon all the\r\n",
      "names of all the sisters; she could say them off better than she could\r\n",
      "say the multiplication-table. She privately wondered moreover, though\r\n",
      "she never asked, about the awful poverty, of which her companion also\r\n",
      "never spoke. Food at any rate came up by mysterious laws; Miss Overmore\r\n",
      "never, like Moddle, had on an apron, and when she ate she held her fork\r\n",
      "with her little finger curled out. The child, who watched her at many\r\n",
      "moments, watched her particularly at that one. \"I think you're lovely,\"\r\n",
      "she often said to her; even mamma, who was lovely too, had not such a\r\n",
      "pretty way with the fork. Maisie associated this showier presence with\r\n",
      "her now being \"big,\" knowing of course that nursery-governesses were\r\n",
      "only for little girls who were not, as she said, \"really\" little. She\r\n",
      "vaguely knew, further, somehow, that the future was still bigger than\r\n",
      "she, and that a part of what made it so was the number of governesses\r\n",
      "lurking in it and ready to dart out. Everything that had happened\r\n",
      "when she was really little was dormant, everything but the positive\r\n",
      "certitude, bequeathed from afar by Moddle, that the natural way for a\r\n",
      "child to have her parents was separate and successive, like her mutton\r\n",
      "and her pudding or her bath and her nap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"DOES he know he lies?\"--that was what she had vivaciously asked Miss\r\n",
      "Overmore on the occasion which was so suddenly to lead to a change in\r\n",
      "her life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Does he know--\" Miss Overmore stared; she had a stocking pulled over\r\n",
      "her hand and was pricking at it with a needle which she poised in the\r\n",
      "act. Her task was homely, but her movement, like all her movements,\r\n",
      "graceful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why papa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That he 'lies'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's what mamma says I'm to tell him--'that he lies and he knows he\r\n",
      "lies.'\" Miss Overmore turned very red, though she laughed out till her\r\n",
      "head fell back; then she pricked again at her muffled hand so hard\r\n",
      "that Maisie wondered how she could bear it. \"AM I to tell him?\" the\r\n",
      "child went on. It was then that her companion addressed her in the\r\n",
      "unmistakeable language of a pair of eyes of deep dark grey. \"I can't say\r\n",
      "No,\" they replied as distinctly as possible; \"I can't say No, because\r\n",
      "I'm afraid of your mamma, don't you see? Yet how can I say Yes after\r\n",
      "your papa has been so kind to me, talking to me so long the other day,\r\n",
      "smiling and flashing his beautiful teeth at me the time we met him in\r\n",
      "the Park, the time when, rejoicing at the sight of us, he left the\r\n",
      "gentlemen he was with and turned and walked with us, stayed with us for\r\n",
      "half an hour?\" Somehow in the light of Miss Overmore's lovely eyes that\r\n",
      "incident came back to Maisie with a charm it hadn't had at the time, and\r\n",
      "this in spite of the fact that after it was over her governess had never\r\n",
      "but once alluded to it. On their way home, when papa had quitted them,\r\n",
      "she had expressed the hope that the child wouldn't mention it to mamma.\r\n",
      "Maisie liked her so, and had so the charmed sense of being liked by her,\r\n",
      "that she accepted this remark as settling the matter and wonderingly\r\n",
      "conformed to it. The wonder now lived again, lived in the recollection\r\n",
      "of what papa had said to Miss Overmore: \"I've only to look at you to see\r\n",
      "you're a person I can appeal to for help to save my daughter.\" Maisie's\r\n",
      "ignorance of what she was to be saved from didn't diminish the pleasure\r\n",
      "of the thought that Miss Overmore was saving her. It seemed to make them\r\n",
      "cling together as in some wild game of \"going round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was therefore all the more startled when her mother said to her in\r\n",
      "connexion with something to be done before her next migration: \"You\r\n",
      "understand of course that she's not going with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie turned quite faint. \"Oh I thought she was.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It doesn't in the least matter, you know, what you think,\" Mrs. Farange\r\n",
      "loudly replied; \"and you had better indeed for the future, miss, learn\r\n",
      "to keep your thoughts to yourself.\" This was exactly what Maisie had\r\n",
      "already learned, and the accomplishment was just the source of her\r\n",
      "mother's irritation. It was of a horrid little critical system, a\r\n",
      "tendency, in her silence, to judge her elders, that this lady suspected\r\n",
      "her, liking as she did, for her own part, a child to be simple and\r\n",
      "confiding. She liked also to hear the report of the whacks she\r\n",
      "administered to Mr. Farange's character, to his pretensions to peace\r\n",
      "of mind: the satisfaction of dealing them diminished when nothing came\r\n",
      "back. The day was at hand, and she saw it, when she should feel more\r\n",
      "delight in hurling Maisie at him than in snatching her away; so much so\r\n",
      "that her conscience winced under the acuteness of a candid friend who\r\n",
      "had remarked that the real end of all their tugging would be that each\r\n",
      "parent would try to make the little girl a burden to the other--a sort\r\n",
      "of game in which a fond mother clearly wouldn't show to advantage. The\r\n",
      "prospect of not showing to advantage, a distinction in which she held\r\n",
      "she had never failed, begot in Ida Farange an ill humour of which\r\n",
      "several persons felt the effect. She determined that Beale at any rate\r\n",
      "should feel it; she reflected afresh that in the study of how to be\r\n",
      "odious to him she must never give way. Nothing could incommode him more\r\n",
      "than not to get the good, for the child, of a nice female appendage who\r\n",
      "had clearly taken a fancy to her. One of the things Ida said to the\r\n",
      "appendage was that Beale's was a house in which no decent woman could\r\n",
      "consent to be seen. It was Miss Overmore herself who explained to\r\n",
      "Maisie that she had had a hope of being allowed to accompany her to her\r\n",
      "father's, and that this hope had been dashed by the way her mother took\r\n",
      "it. \"She says that if I ever do such a thing as enter his service I must\r\n",
      "never expect to show my face in this house again. So I've promised not\r\n",
      "to attempt to go with you. If I wait patiently till you come back here\r\n",
      "we shall certainly be together once more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Waiting patiently, and above all waiting till she should come back\r\n",
      "there, seemed to Maisie a long way round--it reminded her of all the\r\n",
      "things she had been told, first and last, that she should have if she'd\r\n",
      "be good and that in spite of her goodness she had never had at all.\r\n",
      "\"Then who'll take care of me at papa's?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heaven only knows, my own precious!\" Miss Overmore replied, tenderly\r\n",
      "embracing her. There was indeed no doubt that she was dear to this\r\n",
      "beautiful friend. What could have proved it better than the fact that\r\n",
      "before a week was out, in spite of their distressing separation and her\r\n",
      "mother's prohibition and Miss Overmore's scruples and Miss Overmore's\r\n",
      "promise, the beautiful friend had turned up at her father's? The little\r\n",
      "lady already engaged there to come by the hour, a fat dark little lady\r\n",
      "with a foreign name and dirty fingers, who wore, throughout, a bonnet\r\n",
      "that had at first given her a deceptive air, too soon dispelled, of\r\n",
      "not staying long, besides asking her pupil questions that had nothing\r\n",
      "to do with lessons, questions that Beale Farange himself, when two or\r\n",
      "three were repeated to him, admitted to be awfully low--this strange\r\n",
      "apparition faded before the bright creature who had braved everything\r\n",
      "for Maisie's sake. The bright creature told her little charge frankly\r\n",
      "what had happened--that she had really been unable to hold out. She had\r\n",
      "broken her vow to Mrs. Farange; she had struggled for three days and\r\n",
      "then had come straight to Maisie's papa and told him the simple truth.\r\n",
      "She adored his daughter; she couldn't give her up; she'd make for her\r\n",
      "any sacrifice. On this basis it had been arranged that she should stay;\r\n",
      "her courage had been rewarded; she left Maisie in no doubt as to the\r\n",
      "amount of courage she had required. Some of the things she said made\r\n",
      "a particular impression on the child--her declaration for instance\r\n",
      "that when her pupil should get older she'd understand better just how\r\n",
      "\"dreadfully bold\" a young lady, to do exactly what she had done, had\r\n",
      "to be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fortunately your papa appreciates it; he appreciates it IMMENSELY\"--\r\n",
      "that was one of the things Miss Overmore also said, with a striking\r\n",
      "insistence on the adverb. Maisie herself was no less impressed with\r\n",
      "what this martyr had gone through, especially after hearing of the\r\n",
      "terrible letter that had come from Mrs. Farange. Mamma had been so\r\n",
      "angry that, in Miss Overmore's own words, she had loaded her with\r\n",
      "insult--proof enough indeed that they must never look forward to being\r\n",
      "together again under mamma's roof. Mamma's roof, however, had its turn,\r\n",
      "this time, for the child, of appearing but remotely contingent, so that,\r\n",
      "to reassure her, there was scarce a need of her companion's secret,\r\n",
      "solemnly confided--the probability there would be no going back to mamma\r\n",
      "at all. It was Miss Overmore's private conviction, and a part of the\r\n",
      "same communication, that if Mr. Farange's daughter would only show a\r\n",
      "really marked preference she would be backed up by \"public opinion\" in\r\n",
      "holding on to him. Poor Maisie could scarcely grasp that incentive, but\r\n",
      "she could surrender herself to the day. She had conceived her first\r\n",
      "passion, and the object of it was her governess. It hadn't been put to\r\n",
      "her, and she couldn't, or at any rate she didn't, put it to herself,\r\n",
      "that she liked Miss Overmore better than she liked papa; but it would\r\n",
      "have sustained her under such an imputation to feel herself able\r\n",
      "to reply that papa too liked Miss Overmore exactly as much. He had\r\n",
      "particularly told her so. Besides she could easily see it.\r\n",

      "her mother would be at the door in the carriage in which Maisie now rode\r\n",
      "on no occasions but these. There was no question at present of Miss\r\n",
      "Overmore's going back with her: it was universally recognised that her\r\n",

      "away--there was only a frightening silence, unenlivened even by the\r\n",
      "invidious enquiries of former years, which culminated, according to its\r\n",
      "stern nature, in a still more frightening old woman, a figure awaiting\r\n",
      "her on the very doorstep. \"You're to be under this lady's care,\" said\r\n",

      "impatiently and giving the child a push from which Maisie gathered that\r\n",
      "she wished to set Mrs. Wix an example of energy. Mrs. Wix took her and,\r\n",

      "first, just after Miss Overmore, as terrible; but something in her voice\r\n",
      "at the end of an hour touched the little girl in a spot that had never\r\n",
      "even yet been reached. Maisie knew later what it was, though doubtless\r\n",
      "she couldn't have made a statement of it: these were things that a few\r\n",
      "days' talk with Mrs. Wix quite lighted up. The principal one was a\r\n",
      "matter Mrs. Wix herself always immediately mentioned: she had had a\r\n",
      "little girl quite of her own, and the little girl had been killed on\r\n",
      "the spot. She had had absolutely nothing else in all the world, and her\r\n",
      "affliction had broken her heart. It was comfortably established between\r\n",
      "them that Mrs. Wix's heart was broken. What Maisie felt was that she had\r\n",
      "been, with passion and anguish, a mother, and that this was something\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore was not, something (strangely, confusingly) that mamma was\r\n",
      "even less.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So it was that in the course of an extraordinarily short time she\r\n",
      "found herself as deeply absorbed in the image of the little dead\r\n",
      "Clara Matilda, who, on a crossing in the Harrow Road, had been knocked\r\n",
      "down and crushed by the cruellest of hansoms, as she had ever found\r\n",
      "herself in the family group made vivid by one of seven. \"She's your\r\n",
      "little dead sister,\" Mrs. Wix ended by saying, and Maisie, all in\r\n",
      "a tremor of curiosity and compassion, addressed from that moment a\r\n",
      "particular piety to the small accepted acquisition. Somehow she wasn't\r\n",
      "a real sister, but that only made her the more romantic. It contributed\r\n",
      "to this view of her that she was never to be spoken of in that character\r\n",
      "to any one else--least of all to Mrs. Farange, who wouldn't care for\r\n",
      "her nor recognise the relationship: it was to be just an unutterable and\r\n",
      "inexhaustible little secret with Mrs. Wix. Maisie knew everything about\r\n",

      "mutilated life, exactly how lovely she was, exactly how her hair was\r\n",
      "curled and her frocks were trimmed. Her hair came down far below her\r\n",
      "waist--it was of the most wonderful golden brightness, just as Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix's own had been a long time before. Mrs. Wix's own was indeed very\r\n",
      "remarkable still, and Maisie had felt at first that she should never get\r\n",
      "on with it. It played a large part in the sad and strange appearance,\r\n",
      "the appearance as of a kind of greasy greyness, which Mrs. Wix had\r\n",
      "presented on the child's arrival. It had originally been yellow, but\r\n",
      "time had turned that elegance to ashes, to a turbid sallow unvenerable\r\n",
      "white. Still excessively abundant, it was dressed in a manner of which\r\n",
      "the poor lady appeared not yet to have recognised the supersession, with\r\n",
      "a glossy braid, like a large diadem, on the top of the head, and behind,\r\n",
      "at the nape of the neck, a dingy rosette like a large button. She wore\r\n",
      "glasses which, in humble reference to a divergent obliquity of vision,\r\n",
      "she called her straighteners, and a little ugly snuff-coloured dress\r\n",
      "trimmed with satin bands in the form of scallops and glazed with\r\n",
      "antiquity. The straighteners, she explained to Maisie, were put on for\r\n",
      "the sake of others, whom, as she believed, they helped to recognise the\r\n",
      "bearing, otherwise doubtful, of her regard; the rest of the melancholy\r\n",
      "garb could only have been put on for herself. With the added suggestion\r\n",
      "of her goggles it reminded her pupil of the polished shell or corslet\r\n",
      "of a horrid beetle. At first she had looked cross and almost cruel; but\r\n",
      "this impression passed away with the child's increased perception of\r\n",
      "her being in the eyes of the world a figure mainly to laugh at. She\r\n",
      "was as droll as a charade or an animal toward the end of the \"natural\r\n",
      "history\"--a person whom people, to make talk lively, described to each\r\n",
      "other and imitated. Every one knew the straighteners; every one knew the\r\n",
      "diadem and the button, the scallops and satin bands; every one, though\r\n",
      "Maisie had never betrayed her, knew even Clara Matilda.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was on account of these things that mamma got her for such low pay,\r\n",
      "really for nothing: so much, one day when Mrs. Wix had accompanied her\r\n",
      "into the drawing-room and left her, the child heard one of the ladies\r\n",
      "she found there--a lady with eyebrows arched like skipping-ropes and\r\n",
      "thick black stitching, like ruled lines for musical notes on beautiful\r\n",
      "white gloves--announce to another. She knew governesses were poor; Miss\r\n",
      "Overmore was unmentionably and Mrs. Wix ever so publicly so. Neither\r\n",
      "this, however, nor the old brown frock nor the diadem nor the button,\r\n",
      "made a difference for Maisie in the charm put forth through everything,\r\n",
      "the charm of Mrs. Wix's conveying that somehow, in her ugliness and her\r\n",
      "poverty, she was peculiarly and soothingly safe; safer than any one\r\n",
      "in the world, than papa, than mamma, than the lady with the arched\r\n",
      "eyebrows; safer even, though so much less beautiful, than Miss Overmore,\r\n",
      "on whose loveliness, as she supposed it, the little girl was faintly\r\n",
      "conscious that one couldn't rest with quite the same tucked-in and\r\n",
      "kissed-for-good-night feeling. Mrs. Wix was as safe as Clara Matilda,\r\n",
      "who was in heaven and yet, embarrassingly, also in Kensal Green, where\r\n",
      "they had been together to see her little huddled grave. It was from\r\n",
      "something in Mrs. Wix's tone, which in spite of caricature remained\r\n",
      "indescribable and inimitable, that Maisie, before her term with her\r\n",
      "mother was over, drew this sense of a support, like a breast-high\r\n",
      "banister in a place of \"drops,\" that would never give way. If she knew\r\n",
      "her instructress was poor and queer she also knew she was not nearly so\r\n",
      "\"qualified\" as Miss Overmore, who could say lots of dates straight off\r\n",
      "(letting you hold the book yourself), state the position of Malabar, play\r\n",
      "six pieces without notes and, in a sketch, put in beautifully the trees\r\n",
      "and houses and difficult parts. Maisie herself could play more pieces\r\n",
      "than Mrs. Wix, who was moreover visibly ashamed of her houses and trees\r\n",
      "and could only, with the help of a smutty forefinger, of doubtful\r\n",
      "legitimacy in the field of art, do the smoke coming out of the chimneys.\r\n",
      "They dealt, the governess and her pupil, in \"subjects,\" but there were\r\n",
      "many the governess put off from week to week and that they never got to\r\n",
      "at all: she only used to say \"We'll take that in its proper order.\" Her\r\n",
      "order was a circle as vast as the untravelled globe. She had not the\r\n",
      "spirit of adventure--the child could perfectly see how many subjects she\r\n",
      "was afraid of. She took refuge on the firm ground of fiction, through\r\n",
      "which indeed there curled the blue river of truth. She knew swarms of\r\n",
      "stories, mostly those of the novels she had read; relating them with\r\n",
      "a memory that never faltered and a wealth of detail that was Maisie's\r\n",
      "delight. They were all about love and beauty and countesses and\r\n",
      "wickedness. Her conversation was practically an endless narrative,\r\n",
      "a great garden of romance, with sudden vistas into her own life and\r\n",
      "gushing fountains of homeliness. These were the parts where they most\r\n",
      "lingered; she made the child take with her again every step of her long,\r\n",
      "lame course and think it beyond magic or monsters. Her pupil acquired a\r\n",
      "vivid vision of every one who had ever, in her phrase, knocked against\r\n",
      "her--some of them oh so hard!--every one literally but Mr. Wix, her\r\n",
      "husband, as to whom nothing was mentioned save that he had been dead for\r\n",
      "ages. He had been rather remarkably absent from his wife's career, and\r\n",

      "The second parting from Miss Overmore had been bad enough, but this\r\n",
      "first parting from Mrs. Wix was much worse. The child had lately been to\r\n",
      "the dentist's and had a term of comparison for the screwed-up intensity\r\n",
      "of the scene. It was dreadfully silent, as it had been when her tooth\r\n",
      "was taken out; Mrs. Wix had on that occasion grabbed her hand and they\r\n",
      "had clung to each other with the frenzy of their determination not to\r\n",
      "scream. Maisie, at the dentist's, had been heroically still, but just\r\n",
      "when she felt most anguish had become aware of an audible shriek on the\r\n",
      "part of her companion, a spasm of stifled sympathy. This was reproduced\r\n",
      "by the only sound that broke their supreme embrace when, a month later,\r\n",
      "the \"arrangement,\" as her periodical uprootings were called, played the\r\n",
      "part of the horrible forceps. Embedded in Mrs. Wix's nature as her tooth\r\n",
      "had been socketed in her gum, the operation of extracting her would\r\n",
      "really have been a case for chloroform. It was a hug that fortunately\r\n",
      "left nothing to say, for the poor woman's want of words at such an\r\n",
      "hour seemed to fall in with her want of everything. Maisie's alternate\r\n",
      "parent, in the outermost vestibule--he liked the impertinence of\r\n",
      "crossing as much as that of his late wife's threshold--stood over them\r\n",
      "with his open watch and his still more open grin, while from the only\r\n",
      "corner of an eye on which something of Mrs. Wix's didn't impinge the\r\n",
      "child saw at the door a brougham in which Miss Overmore also waited.\r\n",
      "She remembered the difference when, six months before, she had been\r\n",
      "torn from the breast of that more spirited protectress. Miss Overmore,\r\n",
      "then also in the vestibule, but of course in the other one, had been\r\n",
      "thoroughly audible and voluble; her protest had rung out bravely and she\r\n",
      "had declared that something--her pupil didn't know exactly what--was\r\n",
      "a regular wicked shame. That had at the time dimly recalled to Maisie\r\n",
      "the far-away moment of Moddle's great outbreak: there seemed always to\r\n",
      "be \"shames\" connected in one way or another with her migrations. At\r\n",
      "present, while Mrs. Wix's arms tightened and the smell of her hair was\r\n",
      "strong, she further remembered how, in pacifying Miss Overmore, papa had\r\n",
      "made use of the words \"you dear old duck!\"--an expression which, by its\r\n",
      "oddity, had stuck fast in her young mind, having moreover a place well\r\n",
      "prepared for it there by what she knew of the governess whom she now\r\n",
      "always mentally characterised as the pretty one. She wondered whether\r\n",
      "this affection would be as great as before: that would at all events be\r\n",
      "the case with the prettiness Maisie could see in the face which showed\r\n",
      "brightly at the window of the brougham.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The brougham was a token of harmony, of the fine conditions papa would\r\n",
      "this time offer: he had usually come for her in a hansom, with a\r\n",
      "four-wheeler behind for the boxes. The four-wheeler with the boxes on it\r\n",
      "was actually there, but mamma was the only lady with whom she had ever\r\n",
      "been in a conveyance of the kind always of old spoken of by Moddle as a\r\n",
      "private carriage. Papa's carriage was, now that he had one, still more\r\n",
      "private, somehow, than mamma's; and when at last she found herself quite\r\n",
      "on top, as she felt, of its inmates and gloriously rolling away, she\r\n",
      "put to Miss Overmore, after another immense and talkative squeeze, a\r\n",
      "question of which the motive was a desire for information as to the\r\n",
      "continuity of a certain sentiment. \"Did papa like you just the same\r\n",
      "while I was gone?\" she enquired--full of the sense of how markedly his\r\n",
      "favour had been established in her presence. She had bethought herself\r\n",
      "that this favour might, like her presence and as if depending on it, be\r\n",
      "only intermittent and for the season. Papa, on whose knee she sat, burst\r\n",
      "into one of those loud laughs of his that, however prepared she was,\r\n",
      "seemed always, like some trick in a frightening game, to leap forth and\r\n",
      "make her jump. Before Miss Overmore could speak he replied: \"Why, you\r\n",
      "little donkey, when you're away what have I left to do but just to love\r\n",
      "her?\" Miss Overmore hereupon immediately took her from him, and they had\r\n",
      "a merry little scrimmage over her of which Maisie caught the surprised\r\n",
      "perception in the white stare of an old lady who passed in a victoria.\r\n",
      "Then her beautiful friend remarked to her very gravely: \"I shall make\r\n",
      "him understand that if he ever again says anything as horrid as that\r\n",
      "to you I shall carry you straight off and we'll go and live somewhere\r\n",
      "together and be good quiet little girls.\" The child couldn't quite make\r\n",
      "out why her father's speech had been horrid, since it only expressed\r\n",
      "that appreciation which their companion herself had of old described as\r\n",
      "\"immense.\" To enter more into the truth of the matter she appealed to\r\n",
      "him again directly, asked if in all those months Miss Overmore hadn't\r\n",
      "been with him just as she had been before and just as she would be now.\r\n",
      "\"Of course she has, old girl--where else could the poor dear be?\" cried\r\n",
      "Beale Farange, to the still greater scandal of their companion, who\r\n",
      "protested that unless he straightway \"took back\" his nasty wicked fib\r\n",
      "it would be, this time, not only him she would leave, but his child too\r\n",
      "and his house and his tiresome trouble--all the impossible things he\r\n",
      "had succeeded in putting on her. Beale, under this frolic menace, took\r\n",
      "nothing back at all; he was indeed apparently on the point of repeating\r\n",
      "his extravagance, but Miss Overmore instructed her little charge that\r\n",
      "she was not to listen to his bad jokes: she was to understand that a\r\n",
      "lady couldn't stay with a gentleman that way without some awfully proper\r\n",
      "reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie looked from one of her companions to the other; this was the\r\n",
      "freshest gayest start she had yet enjoyed, but she had a shy fear of not\r\n",
      "exactly believing them. \"Well, what reason IS proper?\" she thoughtfully\r\n",
      "demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh a long-legged stick of a tomboy: there's none so good as that.\" Her\r\n",
      "father enjoyed both her drollery and his own and tried again to get\r\n",
      "possession of her--an effort deprecated by their comrade and leading\r\n",
      "again to something of a public scuffle. Miss Overmore declared to the\r\n",
      "child that she had been all the while with good friends; on which Beale\r\n",
      "Farange went on: \"She means good friends of mine, you know--tremendous\r\n",
      "friends of mine. There has been no end of THEM about--that I WILL say\r\n",
      "for her!\" Maisie felt bewildered and was afterwards for some time\r\n",
      "conscious of a vagueness, just slightly embarrassing, as to the subject\r\n",
      "of so much amusement and as to where her governess had really been.\r\n",
      "She didn't feel at all as if she had been seriously told, and no such\r\n",
      "feeling was supplied by anything that occurred later. Her embarrassment,\r\n",
      "of a precocious instinctive order, attached itself to the idea that\r\n",
      "this was another of the matters it was not for her, as her mother used\r\n",
      "to say, to go into. Therefore, under her father's roof during the time\r\n",
      "that followed, she made no attempt to clear up her ambiguity by an\r\n",
      "ingratiating way with housemaids; and it was an odd truth that the\r\n",
      "ambiguity itself took nothing from the fresh pleasure promised her by\r\n",
      "renewed contact with Miss Overmore. The confidence looked for by that\r\n",
      "young lady was of the fine sort that explanation can't improve, and she\r\n",
      "herself at any rate was a person superior to any confusion. For Maisie\r\n",
      "moreover concealment had never necessarily seemed deception; she had\r\n",
      "grown up among things as to which her foremost knowledge was that\r\n",
      "she was never to ask about them. It was far from new to her that the\r\n",
      "questions of the small are the peculiar diversion of the great: except\r\n",
      "the affairs of her doll Lisette there had scarcely ever been anything at\r\n",
      "her mother's that was explicable with a grave face. Nothing was so easy\r\n",
      "to her as to send the ladies who gathered there off into shrieks, and\r\n",
      "she might have practised upon them largely if she had been of a more\r\n",
      "calculating turn. Everything had something behind it: life was like a\r\n",
      "long, long corridor with rows of closed doors. She had learned that at\r\n",
      "these doors it was wise not to knock--this seemed to produce from within\r\n",
      "such sounds of derision. Little by little, however, she understood more,\r\n",
      "for it befell that she was enlightened by Lisette's questions, which\r\n",
      "reproduced the effect of her own upon those for whom she sat in the very\r\n",
      "darkness of Lisette. Was she not herself convulsed by such innocence? In\r\n",
      "the presence of it she often imitated the shrieking ladies. There were\r\n",
      "at any rate things she really couldn't tell even a French doll. She\r\n",
      "could only pass on her lessons and study to produce on Lisette the\r\n",
      "impression of having mysteries in her life, wondering the while whether\r\n",
      "she succeeded in the air of shading off, like her mother, into the\r\n",
      "unknowable. When the reign of Miss Overmore followed that of Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "she took a fresh cue, emulating her governess and bridging over the\r\n",
      "interval with the simple expectation of trust. Yes, there were matters\r\n",
      "one couldn't \"go into\" with a pupil. There were for instance days when,\r\n",
      "after prolonged absence, Lisette, watching her take off her things,\r\n",
      "tried hard to discover where she had been. Well, she discovered a\r\n",
      "little, but never discovered all. There was an occasion when, on her\r\n",
      "being particularly indiscreet, Maisie replied to her--and precisely\r\n",
      "about the motive of a disappearance--as she, Maisie, had once been\r\n",
      "replied to by Mrs. Farange: \"Find out for yourself!\" She mimicked her\r\n",

      "intimated, to Mr. Farange himself and to the friendly noisy little house\r\n",
      "and those who came there. Mr. Farange's remedy for every inconvenience\r\n",
      "was that the child should be put at school--there were such lots of\r\n",
      "splendid schools, as everybody knew, at Brighton and all over the place.\r\n",
      "That, however, Maisie learned, was just what would bring her mother\r\n",

      "whenever the question had been touched upon in talk with her governess.\r\n",
      "\"Oh you needn't worry: she doesn't care!\" Miss Overmore had often\r\n",
      "said to her in reference to any fear that her mother might resent her\r\n",
      "prolonged detention. \"She has other people than poor little YOU to\r\n",
      "think about, and has gone abroad with them; so you needn't be in the\r\n",
      "least afraid she'll stickle this time for her rights.\" Maisie knew Mrs.\r\n",
      "Farange had gone abroad, for she had had weeks and weeks before a letter\r\n",
      "from her beginning \"My precious pet\" and taking leave of her for an\r\n",
      "indeterminate time; but she had not seen in it a renunciation of hatred\r\n",
      "or of the writer's policy of asserting herself, for the sharpest of all\r\n",
      "her impressions had been that there was nothing her mother would ever\r\n",
      "care so much about as to torment Mr. Farange. What at last, however, was\r\n",
      "in this connexion bewildering and a little frightening was the dawn of a\r\n",
      "suspicion that a better way had been found to torment Mr. Farange than\r\n",
      "to deprive him of his periodical burden. This was the question that\r\n",
      "worried our young lady and that Miss Overmore's confidences and the\r\n",
      "frequent observations of her employer only rendered more mystifying. It\r\n",
      "was a contradiction that if Ida had now a fancy for waiving the rights\r\n",
      "she had originally been so hot about her late husband shouldn't jump at\r\n",
      "the monopoly for which he had also in the first instance so fiercely\r\n",
      "fought; but when Maisie, with a subtlety beyond her years, sounded this\r\n",
      "new ground her main success was in hearing her mother more freshly\r\n",
      "abused. Miss Overmore had up to now rarely deviated from a decent\r\n",
      "reserve, but the day came when she expressed herself with a vividness\r\n",
      "not inferior to Beale's own on the subject of the lady who had fled to\r\n",
      "the Continent to wriggle out of her job. It would serve this lady right,\r\n",
      "Maisie gathered, if that contract, in the shape of an overgrown and\r\n",
      "underdressed daughter, should be shipped straight out to her and landed\r\n",
      "at her feet in the midst of scandalous excesses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The picture of these pursuits was what Miss Overmore took refuge in when\r\n",
      "the child tried timidly to ascertain if her father were disposed to feel\r\n",
      "he had too much of her. She evaded the point and only kicked up all\r\n",
      "round it the dust of Ida's heartlessness and folly, of which the supreme\r\n",
      "proof, it appeared, was the fact that she was accompanied on her journey\r\n",
      "by a gentleman whom, to be painfully plain on it, she had--well, \"picked\r\n",
      "up.\" The terms on which, unless they were married, ladies and gentlemen\r\n",
      "might, as Miss Overmore expressed it, knock about together, were the\r\n",
      "terms on which she and Mr. Farange had exposed themselves to possible\r\n",
      "misconception. She had indeed, as has been noted, often explained this\r\n",
      "before, often said to Maisie: \"I don't know what in the world, darling,\r\n",
      "your father and I should do without you, for you just make the\r\n",
      "difference, as I've told you, of keeping us perfectly proper.\" The child\r\n",
      "took in the office it was so endearingly presented to her that she\r\n",
      "performed a comfort that helped her to a sense of security even in the\r\n",
      "event of her mother's giving her up. Familiar as she had grown with the\r\n",
      "fact of the great alternative to the proper, she felt in her governess\r\n",
      "and her father a strong reason for not emulating that detachment. At the\r\n",
      "same time she had heard somehow of little girls--of exalted rank, it was\r\n",
      "true--whose education was carried on by instructors of the other sex,\r\n",
      "and she knew that if she were at school at Brighton it would be thought\r\n",
      "an advantage to her to be more or less in the hands of masters. She\r\n",
      "turned these things over and remarked to Miss Overmore that if she\r\n",
      "should go to her mother perhaps the gentleman might become her tutor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The gentleman?\" The proposition was complicated enough to make Miss\r\n",
      "Overmore stare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The one who's with mamma. Mightn't that make it right--as right as your\r\n",
      "being my governess makes it for you to be with papa?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore considered; she coloured a little; then she embraced her\r\n",
      "ingenious friend. \"You're too sweet! I'm a REAL governess.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And couldn't he be a real tutor?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course not. He's ignorant and bad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bad--?\" Maisie echoed with wonder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion gave a queer little laugh at her tone. \"He's ever so much\r\n",
      "younger--\" But that was all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Younger than you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore laughed again; it was the first time Maisie had seen her\r\n",
      "approach so nearly to a giggle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Younger than--no matter whom. I don't know anything about him and don't\r\n",
      "want to,\" she rather inconsequently added. \"He's not my sort, and I'm\r\n",
      "sure, my own darling, he's not yours.\" And she repeated the free caress\r\n",
      "into which her colloquies with Maisie almost always broke and which made\r\n",
      "the child feel that HER affection at least was a gage of safety. Parents\r\n",
      "had come to seem vague, but governesses were evidently to be trusted.\r\n",
      "Maisie's faith in Mrs. Wix for instance had suffered no lapse from the\r\n",
      "fact that all communication with her had temporarily dropped. During the\r\n",
      "first weeks of their separation Clara Matilda's mamma had repeatedly and\r\n",
      "dolefully written to her, and Maisie had answered with an enthusiasm\r\n",
      "controlled only by orthographical doubts; but the correspondence had\r\n",
      "been duly submitted to Miss Overmore, with the final effect of its not\r\n",
      "suiting her. It was this lady's view that Mr. Farange wouldn't care for\r\n",
      "it at all, and she ended by confessing--since her pupil pushed her--that\r\n",
      "she didn't care for it herself. She was furiously jealous, she said; and\r\n",
      "that weakness was but a new proof of her disinterested affection. She\r\n",
      "pronounced Mrs. Wix's effusions moreover illiterate and unprofitable;\r\n",
      "she made no scruple of declaring it monstrous that a woman in her\r\n",
      "senses should have placed the formation of her daughter's mind in such\r\n",
      "ridiculous hands. Maisie was well aware that the proprietress of the old\r\n",
      "brown dress and the old odd headgear was lower in the scale of \"form\"\r\n",
      "than Miss Overmore; but it was now brought home to her with pain that\r\n",
      "she was educationally quite out of the question. She was buried for the\r\n",
      "time beneath a conclusive remark of her critic's: \"She's really beyond a\r\n",
      "joke!\" This remark was made as that charming woman held in her hand the\r\n",
      "last letter that Maisie was to receive from Mrs. Wix; it was fortified\r\n",
      "by a decree proscribing the preposterous tie. \"Must I then write and\r\n",
      "tell her?\" the child bewilderedly asked: she grew pale at the dreadful\r\n",
      "things it appeared involved for her to say. \"Don't dream of it, my\r\n",
      "dear--I'll write: you may trust me!\" cried Miss Overmore; who indeed\r\n",
      "wrote to such purpose that a hush in which you could have heard a pin\r\n",
      "drop descended upon poor Mrs. Wix. She gave for weeks and weeks no sign\r\n",
      "whatever of life: it was as if she had been as effectually disposed of\r\n",
      "by Miss Overmore's communication as her little girl, in the Harrow Road,\r\n",
      "had been disposed of by the terrible hansom. Her very silence became\r\n",
      "after this one of the largest elements of Maisie's consciousness; it\r\n",
      "proved a warm and habitable air, into which the child penetrated further\r\n",
      "than she dared ever to mention to her companions. Somewhere in the\r\n",
      "depths of it the dim straighteners were fixed upon her; somewhere out of\r\n",
      "the troubled little current Mrs. Wix intensely waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It quite fell in with this intensity that one day, on returning from\r\n",
      "a walk with the housemaid, Maisie should have found her in the hall,\r\n",
      "seated on the stool usually occupied by the telegraph-boys who haunted\r\n",
      "Beale Farange's door and kicked their heels while, in his room, answers\r\n",
      "to their missives took form with the aid of smoke-puffs and growls. It\r\n",
      "had seemed to her on their parting that Mrs. Wix had reached the last\r\n",
      "limits of the squeeze, but she now felt those limits to be transcended\r\n",
      "and that the duration of her visitor's hug was a direct reply to Miss\r\n",
      "Overmore's veto. She understood in a flash how the visit had come to be\r\n",
      "possible--that Mrs. Wix, watching her chance, must have slipped in under\r\n",
      "protection of the fact that papa, always tormented in spite of arguments\r\n",
      "with the idea of a school, had, for a three days' excursion to Brighton,\r\n",
      "absolutely insisted on the attendance of her adversary. It was true that\r\n",
      "when Maisie explained their absence and their important motive Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "wore an expression so peculiar that it could only have had its origin in\r\n",
      "surprise. This contradiction indeed peeped out only to vanish, for at\r\n",
      "the very moment that, in the spirit of it, she threw herself afresh upon\r\n",
      "her young friend a hansom crested with neat luggage rattled up to the\r\n",
      "door and Miss Overmore bounded out. The shock of her encounter with Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix was less violent than Maisie had feared on seeing her and didn't\r\n",
      "at all interfere with the sociable tone in which, under her rival's\r\n",
      "eyes, she explained to her little charge that she had returned, for a\r\n",
      "particular reason, a day sooner than she first intended. She had left\r\n",
      "papa--in such nice lodgings--at Brighton; but he would come back to\r\n",
      "his dear little home on the morrow. As for Mrs. Wix, papa's companion\r\n",
      "supplied Maisie in later converse with the right word for the attitude\r\n",
      "of this personage: Mrs. Wix \"stood up\" to her in a manner that the child\r\n",
      "herself felt at the time to be astonishing. This occurred indeed after\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore had so far raised her interdict as to make a move to the\r\n",
      "dining-room, where, in the absence of any suggestion of sitting down,\r\n",
      "it was scarcely more than natural that even poor Mrs. Wix should stand\r\n",
      "up. Maisie at once enquired if at Brighton, this time, anything had\r\n",
      "come of the possibility of a school; to which, much to her surprise,\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore, who had always grandly repudiated it, replied after an\r\n",
      "instant, but quite as if Mrs. Wix were not there:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It may be, darling, that something WILL come. The objection, I must\r\n",
      "tell you, has been quite removed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this it was still more startling to hear Mrs. Wix speak out with\r\n",
      "great firmness. \"I don't think, if you'll allow me to say so, that\r\n",
      "there's any arrangement by which the objection CAN be 'removed.' What\r\n",
      "has brought me here to-day is that I've a message for Maisie from dear\r\n",
      "Mrs. Farange.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child's heart gave a great thump. \"Oh mamma's come back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not yet, sweet love, but she's coming,\" said Mrs. Wix, \"and she\r\n",
      "has--most thoughtfully, you know--sent me on to prepare you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To prepare her for what, pray?\" asked Miss Overmore, whose first\r\n",
      "smoothness began, with this news, to be ruffled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix quietly applied her straighteners to Miss Overmore's flushed\r\n",
      "beauty. \"Well, miss, for a very important communication.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can't dear Mrs. Farange, as you so oddly call her, make her\r\n",
      "communications directly? Can't she take the trouble to write to her only\r\n",
      "daughter?\" the younger lady demanded. \"Maisie herself will tell you that\r\n",
      "it's months and months since she has had so much as a word from her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but I've written to mamma!\" cried the child as if this would do\r\n",
      "quite as well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That makes her treatment of you all the greater scandal,\" the governess\r\n",
      "in possession promptly declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Farange is too well aware,\" said Mrs. Wix with sustained spirit,\r\n",
      "\"of what becomes of her letters in this house.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie's sense of fairness hereupon interposed for her visitor. \"You\r\n",
      "know, Miss Overmore, that papa doesn't like everything of mamma's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No one likes, my dear, to be made the subject of such language as your\r\n",
      "mother's letters contain. They were not fit for the innocent child to\r\n",
      "see,\" Miss Overmore observed to Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I don't know what you complain of, and she's better without them.\r\n",
      "It serves every purpose that I'm in Mrs. Farange's confidence.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore gave a scornful laugh. \"Then you must be mixed up with\r\n",
      "some extraordinary proceedings!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"None so extraordinary,\" cried Mrs. Wix, turning very pale, \"as to say\r\n",
      "horrible things about the mother to the face of the helpless daughter!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Things not a bit more horrible, I think,\" Miss Overmore returned, \"than\r\n",
      "those you, madam, appear to have come here to say about the father!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix looked for a moment hard at Maisie, and then, turning again to\r\n",
      "this witness, spoke with a trembling voice. \"I came to say nothing about\r\n",
      "him, and you must excuse Mrs. Farange and me if we're not so above all\r\n",
      "reproach as the companion of his travels.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young woman thus described stared at the apparent breadth of the\r\n",
      "description--she needed a moment to take it in. Maisie, however, gazing\r\n",
      "solemnly from one of the disputants to the other, noted that her answer,\r\n",
      "when it came, perched upon smiling lips. \"It will do quite as well,\r\n",
      "no doubt, if you come up to the requirements of the companion of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Farange's!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix broke into a queer laugh; it sounded to Maisie an unsuccessful\r\n",
      "imitation of a neigh. \"That's just what I'm here to make known--how\r\n",
      "perfectly the poor lady comes up to them herself.\" She held up her head\r\n",
      "at the child. \"You must take your mamma's message, Maisie, and you must\r\n",
      "feel that her wishing me to come to you with it this way is a great\r\n",
      "proof of interest and affection. She sends you her particular love and\r\n",
      "announces to you that she's engaged to be married to Sir Claude.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir Claude?\" Maisie wonderingly echoed. But while Mrs. Wix explained\r\n",
      "that this gentleman was a dear friend of Mrs. Farange's, who had been\r\n",
      "of great assistance to her in getting to Florence and in making herself\r\n",
      "comfortable there for the winter, she was not too violently shaken to\r\n",
      "perceive her old friend's enjoyment of the effect of this news on Miss\r\n",
      "Overmore. That young lady opened her eyes very wide; she immediately\r\n",
      "remarked that Mrs. Farange's marriage would of course put an end to any\r\n",
      "further pretension to take her daughter back. Mrs. Wix enquired with\r\n",
      "astonishment why it should do anything of the sort, and Miss Overmore\r\n",
      "gave as an instant reason that it was clearly but another dodge in a\r\n",
      "system of dodges. She wanted to get out of the bargain: why else had she\r\n",
      "now left Maisie on her father's hands weeks and weeks beyond the time\r\n",
      "about which she had originally made such a fuss? It was vain for Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix to represent--as she speciously proceeded to do--that all this time\r\n",
      "would be made up as soon as Mrs. Farange returned: she, Miss Overmore,\r\n",
      "knew nothing, thank heaven, about her confederate, but was very sure\r\n",
      "any person capable of forming that sort of relation with the lady in\r\n",
      "Florence would easily agree to object to the presence in his house\r\n",
      "of the fruit of a union that his dignity must ignore. It was a game\r\n",
      "like another, and Mrs. Wix's visit was clearly the first move in it.\r\n",
      "Maisie found in this exchange of asperities a fresh incitement to the\r\n",
      "unformulated fatalism in which her sense of her own career had long\r\n",
      "since taken refuge; and it was the beginning for her of a deeper\r\n",
      "prevision that, in spite of Miss Overmore's brilliancy and Mrs. Wix's\r\n",
      "passion, she should live to see a change in the nature of the struggle\r\n",
      "she appeared to have come into the world to produce. It would still be\r\n",
      "essentially a struggle, but its object would now be NOT to receive her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix, after Miss Overmore's last demonstration, addressed herself\r\n",
      "wholly to the little girl, and, drawing from the pocket of her dingy old\r\n",
      "pelisse a small flat parcel, removed its envelope and wished to know\r\n",
      "if THAT looked like a gentleman who wouldn't be nice to everybody--let\r\n",
      "alone to a person he would be so sure to find so nice. Mrs. Farange, in\r\n",
      "the candour of new-found happiness, had enclosed a \"cabinet\" photograph\r\n",
      "of Sir Claude, and Maisie lost herself in admiration of the fair smooth\r\n",
      "face, the regular features, the kind eyes, the amiable air, the general\r\n",
      "glossiness and smartness of her prospective stepfather--only vaguely\r\n",
      "puzzled to suppose herself now with two fathers at once. Her researches\r\n",
      "had hitherto indicated that to incur a second parent of the same sex you\r\n",
      "had usually to lose the first. \"ISN'T he sympathetic?\" asked Mrs. Wix,\r\n",
      "who had clearly, on the strength of his charming portrait, made up her\r\n",
      "mind that Sir Claude promised her a future. \"You can see, I hope,\" she\r\n",
      "added with much expression, \"that HE'S a perfect gentleman!\" Maisie had\r\n",
      "never before heard the word \"sympathetic\" applied to anybody's face; she\r\n",
      "heard it with pleasure and from that moment it agreeably remained with\r\n",
      "her. She testified moreover to the force of her own perception in a\r\n",
      "small soft sigh of response to the pleasant eyes that seemed to seek\r\n",
      "her acquaintance, to speak to her directly. \"He's quite lovely!\" she\r\n",
      "declared to Mrs. Wix. Then eagerly, irrepressibly, as she still held the\r\n",
      "photograph and Sir Claude continued to fraternise, \"Oh can't I keep it?\"\r\n",
      "she broke out. No sooner had she done so than she looked up from it at\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore: this was with the sudden instinct of appealing to the\r\n",
      "authority that had long ago impressed on her that she mustn't ask for\r\n",
      "things. Miss Overmore, to her surprise, looked distant and rather odd,\r\n",
      "hesitating and giving her time to turn again to Mrs. Wix. Then Maisie\r\n",
      "saw that lady's long face lengthen; it was stricken and almost scared,\r\n",
      "as if her young friend really expected more of her than she had to give.\r\n",
      "The photograph was a possession that, direly denuded, she clung to,\r\n",
      "and there was a momentary struggle between her fond clutch of it and\r\n",
      "her capability of every sacrifice for her precarious pupil. With the\r\n",
      "acuteness of her years, however, Maisie saw that her own avidity would\r\n",
      "triumph, and she held out the picture to Miss Overmore as if she were\r\n",
      "quite proud of her mother. \"Isn't he just lovely?\" she demanded while\r\n",
      "poor Mrs. Wix hungrily wavered, her straighteners largely covering it\r\n",
      "and her pelisse gathered about her with an intensity that strained its\r\n",
      "ancient seams.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was to ME, darling,\" the visitor said, \"that your mamma so\r\n",
      "generously sent it; but of course if it would give you particular\r\n",
      "pleasure--\" she faltered, only gasping her surrender.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore continued extremely remote. \"If the photograph's your\r\n",
      "property, my dear, I shall be happy to oblige you by looking at it on\r\n",
      "some future occasion. But you must excuse me if I decline to touch an\r\n",
      "object belonging to Mrs. Wix.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That lady had by this time grown very red. \"You might as well see him\r\n",
      "this way, miss,\" she retorted, \"as you certainly never will, I believe,\r\n",
      "in any other! Keep the pretty picture, by all means, my precious,\" she\r\n",
      "went on: \"Sir Claude will be happy himself, I dare say, to give me one\r\n",
      "with a kind inscription.\" The pathetic quaver of this brave boast was\r\n",
      "not lost on Maisie, who threw herself so gratefully on the speaker's\r\n",
      "neck that, when they had concluded their embrace, the public tenderness\r\n",
      "of which, she felt, made up for the sacrifice she imposed, their\r\n",
      "companion had had time to lay a quick hand on Sir Claude and, with a\r\n",
      "glance at him or not, whisk him effectually out of sight. Released from\r\n",
      "the child's arms Mrs. Wix looked about for the picture; then she fixed\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore with a hard dumb stare; and finally, with her eyes on\r\n",
      "the little girl again, achieved the grimmest of smiles. \"Well, nothing\r\n",
      "matters, Maisie, because there's another thing your mamma wrote about.\r\n",
      "She has made sure of me.\" Even after her loyal hug Maisie felt a bit of\r\n",
      "a sneak as she glanced at Miss Overmore for permission to understand\r\n",
      "this. But Mrs. Wix left them in no doubt of what it meant. \"She has\r\n",
      "definitely engaged me--for her return and for yours. Then you'll see\r\n",
      "for yourself.\" Maisie, on the spot, quite believed she should; but\r\n",
      "the prospect was suddenly thrown into confusion by an extraordinary\r\n",
      "demonstration from Miss Overmore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Wix,\" said that young lady, \"has some undiscoverable reason for\r\n",
      "regarding your mother's hold on you as strengthened by the fact that\r\n",
      "she's about to marry. I wonder then--on that system--what our visitor\r\n",
      "will say to your father's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore's words were directed to her pupil, but her face, lighted\r\n",
      "with an irony that made it prettier even than ever before, was presented\r\n",
      "to the dingy figure that had stiffened itself for departure. The\r\n",
      "child's discipline had been bewildering--had ranged freely between the\r\n",
      "prescription that she was to answer when spoken to and the experience of\r\n",
      "lively penalties on obeying that prescription. This time, nevertheless,\r\n",
      "she felt emboldened for risks; above all as something portentous seemed\r\n",
      "to have leaped into her sense of the relations of things. She looked at\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore much as she had a way of looking at persons who treated\r\n",
      "her to \"grown up\" jokes. \"Do you mean papa's hold on me--do you mean\r\n",
      "HE'S about to marry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Papa's not about to marry--papa IS married, my dear. Papa was married\r\n",
      "the day before yesterday at Brighton.\" Miss Overmore glittered more\r\n",
      "gaily; meanwhile it came over Maisie, and quite dazzlingly, that her\r\n",
      "\"smart\" governess was a bride. \"He's my husband, if you please, and I'm\r\n",
      "his little wife. So NOW we'll see who's your little mother!\" She caught\r\n",
      "her pupil to her bosom in a manner that was not to be outdone by the\r\n",
      "emissary of her predecessor, and a few moments later, when things had\r\n",
      "lurched back into their places, that poor lady, quite defeated of the\r\n",
      "last word, had soundlessly taken flight.\r\n",

      "VIII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After Mrs. Wix's retreat Miss Overmore appeared to recognise that she\r\n",
      "was not exactly in a position to denounce Ida Farange's second union;\r\n",
      "but she drew from a table-drawer the photograph of Sir Claude and,\r\n",
      "standing there before Maisie, studied it at some length.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't he beautiful?\" the child ingenuously asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion hesitated. \"No--he's horrid,\" she, to Maisie's surprise,\r\n",
      "sharply returned. But she debated another minute, after which she handed\r\n",
      "back the picture. It appeared to Maisie herself to exhibit a fresh\r\n",
      "attraction, and she was troubled, having never before had occasion to\r\n",
      "differ from her lovely friend. So she only could ask what, such being\r\n",
      "the case, she should do with it: should she put it quite away--where\r\n",
      "it wouldn't be there to offend? On this Miss Overmore again cast\r\n",
      "about; after which she said unexpectedly: \"Put it on the schoolroom\r\n",
      "mantelpiece.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie felt a fear. \"Won't papa dislike to see it there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very much indeed; but that won't matter NOW.\" Miss Overmore spoke with\r\n",
      "peculiar significance and to her pupil's mystification.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On account of the marriage?\" Maisie risked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Overmore laughed, and Maisie could see that in spite of the\r\n",
      "irritation produced by Mrs. Wix she was in high spirits. \"Which marriage\r\n",
      "do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the question put to her it suddenly struck the child she didn't\r\n",
      "know, so that she felt she looked foolish. So she took refuge in saying:\r\n",
      "\"Shall YOU be different--\" This was a full implication that the bride of\r\n",
      "Sir Claude would be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As your father's wedded wife? Utterly!\" Miss Overmore replied. And the\r\n",
      "difference began of course in her being addressed, even by Maisie, from\r\n",
      "that day and by her particular request, as Mrs. Beale. It was there\r\n",
      "indeed principally that it ended, for except that the child could\r\n",
      "reflect that she should presently have four parents in all, and also\r\n",
      "that at the end of three months the staircase, for a little girl hanging\r\n",
      "over banisters, sent up the deepening rustle of more elaborate advances,\r\n",
      "everything made the same impression as before. Mrs. Beale had very\r\n",
      "pretty frocks, but Miss Overmore's had been quite as good, and if papa\r\n",
      "was much fonder of his second wife than he had been of his first Maisie\r\n",
      "had foreseen that fondness, had followed its development almost as\r\n",
      "closely as the person more directly involved. There was little indeed in\r\n",
      "the commerce of her companions that her precocious experience couldn't\r\n",
      "explain, for if they struck her as after all rather deficient in that\r\n",
      "air of the honeymoon of which she had so often heard--in much detail,\r\n",
      "for instance, from Mrs. Wix--it was natural to judge the circumstance\r\n",
      "in the light of papa's proved disposition to contest the empire of the\r\n",
      "matrimonial tie. His honeymoon, when he came back from Brighton--not\r\n",
      "on the morrow of Mrs. Wix's visit, and not, oddly, till several days\r\n",
      "later--his honeymoon was perhaps perceptibly tinged with the dawn of a\r\n",
      "later stage of wedlock. There were things dislike of which, as the child\r\n",
      "knew it, wouldn't matter to Mrs. Beale now, and their number increased\r\n",
      "so that such a trifle as his hostility to the photograph of Sir Claude\r\n",
      "quite dropped out of view. This pleasing object found a conspicuous\r\n",
      "place in the schoolroom, which in truth Mr. Farange seldom entered and\r\n",
      "in which silent admiration formed, during the time I speak of, almost\r\n",
      "the sole scholastic exercise of Mrs. Beale's pupil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie was not long in seeing just what her stepmother had meant by the\r\n",
      "difference she should show in her new character. If she was her father's\r\n",
      "wife she was not her own governess, and if her presence had had formerly\r\n",
      "to be made regular by the theory of a humble function she was now on a\r\n",
      "footing that dispensed with all theories and was inconsistent with all\r\n",
      "servitude. That was what she had meant by the drop of the objection to\r\n",
      "a school; her small companion was no longer required at home as--it was\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale's own amusing word--a little duenna. The argument against\r\n",
      "a successor to Miss Overmore remained: it was composed frankly of the\r\n",
      "fact, of which Mrs. Beale granted the full absurdity, that she was too\r\n",
      "awfully fond of her stepdaughter to bring herself to see her in vulgar\r\n",
      "and mercenary hands. The note of this particular danger emboldened\r\n",
      "Maisie to put in a word for Mrs. Wix, the modest measure of whose\r\n",
      "avidity she had taken from the first; but Mrs. Beale disposed afresh and\r\n",
      "effectually of a candidate who would be sure to act in some horrible\r\n",
      "and insidious way for Ida's interest and who moreover was personally\r\n",
      "loathsome and as ignorant as a fish. She made also no more of a secret\r\n",
      "of the awkward fact that a good school would be hideously expensive, and\r\n",
      "of the further circumstance, which seemed to put an end to everything,\r\n",
      "that when it came to the point papa, in spite of his previous clamour,\r\n",
      "was really most nasty about paying. \"Would you believe,\" Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "confidentially asked of her little charge, \"that he says I'm a worse\r\n",
      "expense than ever, and that a daughter and a wife together are really\r\n",
      "more than he can afford?\" It was thus that the splendid school at\r\n",
      "Brighton lost itself in the haze of larger questions, though the fear\r\n",
      "that it would provoke Ida to leap into the breach subsided with her\r\n",
      "prolonged, her quite shameless non-appearance. Her daughter and her\r\n",
      "successor were therefore left to gaze in united but helpless blankness\r\n",
      "at all Maisie was not learning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This quantity was so great as to fill the child's days with a sense of\r\n",
      "intermission to which even French Lisette gave no accent--with finished\r\n",
      "games and unanswered questions and dreaded tests; with the habit, above\r\n",
      "all, in her watch for a change, of hanging over banisters when the\r\n",
      "door-bell sounded. This was the great refuge of her impatience, but\r\n",
      "what she heard at such times was a clatter of gaiety downstairs; the\r\n",
      "impression of which, from her earliest childhood, had built up in her\r\n",
      "the belief that the grown-up time was the time of real amusement and\r\n",
      "above all of real intimacy. Even Lisette, even Mrs. Wix had never, she\r\n",
      "felt, in spite of hugs and tears, been so intimate with her as so many\r\n",
      "persons at present were with Mrs. Beale and as so many others of old had\r\n",
      "been with Mrs. Farange. The note of hilarity brought people together\r\n",
      "still more than the note of melancholy, which was the one exclusively\r\n",
      "sounded, for instance, by poor Mrs. Wix. Maisie in these days preferred\r\n",
      "none the less that domestic revels should be wafted to her from a\r\n",
      "distance: she felt sadly unsupported for facing the inquisition of the\r\n",
      "drawing-room. That was a reason the more for making the most of Susan\r\n",
      "Ash, who in her quality of under-housemaid moved at a very different\r\n",
      "level and who, none the less, was much depended upon out of doors. She\r\n",
      "was a guide to peregrinations that had little in common with those\r\n",
      "intensely definite airings that had left with the child a vivid memory\r\n",
      "of the regulated mind of Moddle. There had been under Moddle's system\r\n",
      "no dawdles at shop-windows and no nudges, in Oxford Street, of \"I SAY,\r\n",
      "look at 'ER!\" There had been an inexorable treatment of crossings and a\r\n",
      "serene exemption from the fear that--especially at corners, of which she\r\n",
      "was yet weakly fond--haunted the housemaid, the fear of being, as she\r\n",
      "ominously said, \"spoken to.\" The dangers of the town equally with its\r\n",
      "diversions added to Maisie's sense of being untutored and unclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The situation however, had taken a twist when, on another of her\r\n",
      "returns, at Susan's side, extremely tired, from the pursuit of exercise\r\n",
      "qualified by much hovering, she encountered another emotion. She on this\r\n",
      "occasion learnt at the door that her instant attendance was requested\r\n",
      "in the drawing-room. Crossing the threshold in a cloud of shame she\r\n",
      "discerned through the blur Mrs. Beale seated there with a gentleman who\r\n",
      "immediately drew the pain from her predicament by rising before her as\r\n",
      "the original of the photograph of Sir Claude. She felt the moment she\r\n",
      "looked at him that he was by far the most shining presence that had ever\r\n",
      "made her gape, and her pleasure in seeing him, in knowing that he took\r\n",
      "hold of her and kissed her, as quickly throbbed into a strange shy pride\r\n",
      "in him, a perception of his making up for her fallen state, for Susan's\r\n",
      "public nudges, which quite bruised her, and for all the lessons that, in\r\n",
      "the dead schoolroom, where at times she was almost afraid to stay alone,\r\n",
      "she was bored with not having. It was as if he had told her on the spot\r\n",
      "that he belonged to her, so that she could already show him off and see\r\n",
      "the effect he produced. No, nothing else that was most beautiful ever\r\n",
      "belonging to her could kindle that particular joy--not Mrs. Beale at\r\n",
      "that very moment, not papa when he was gay, nor mamma when she was\r\n",
      "dressed, nor Lisette when she was new. The joy almost overflowed\r\n",
      "in tears when he laid his hand on her and drew her to him, telling\r\n",
      "her, with a smile of which the promise was as bright as that of a\r\n",
      "Christmas-tree, that he knew her ever so well by her mother, but had\r\n",
      "come to see her now so that he might know her for himself. She could\r\n",
      "see that his view of this kind of knowledge was to make her come away\r\n",
      "with him, and, further, that it was just what he was there for and had\r\n",
      "already been some time: arranging it with Mrs. Beale and getting on with\r\n",
      "that lady in a manner evidently not at all affected by her having on the\r\n",
      "arrival of his portrait thought of him so ill. They had grown almost\r\n",
      "intimate--or had the air of it--over their discussion; and it was still\r\n",
      "further conveyed to Maisie that Mrs. Beale had made no secret, and would\r\n",
      "make yet less of one, of all that it cost to let her go. \"You seem so\r\n",
      "tremendously eager,\" she said to the child, \"that I hope you're at least\r\n",
      "clear about Sir Claude's relation to you. It doesn't appear to occur to\r\n",
      "him to give you the necessary reassurance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, a trifle mystified, turned quickly to her new friend. \"Why it's\r\n",
      "of course that you're MARRIED to her, isn't it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her anxious emphasis started them off, as she had learned to call it;\r\n",
      "this was the echo she infallibly and now quite resignedly produced;\r\n",
      "moreover Sir Claude's laughter was an indistinguishable part of the\r\n",
      "sweetness of his being there. \"We've been married, my dear child, three\r\n",
      "months, and my interest in you is a consequence, don't you know? of my\r\n",
      "great affection for your mother. In coming here it's of course for your\r\n",
      "mother I'm acting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know,\" Maisie said with all the candour of her competence. \"She\r\n",
      "can't come herself--except just to the door.\" Then as she thought\r\n",
      "afresh: \"Can't she come even to the door now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There you are!\" Mrs. Beale exclaimed to Sir Claude. She spoke as if his\r\n",
      "dilemma were ludicrous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His kind face, in a hesitation, seemed to recognise it; but he answered\r\n",
      "the child with a frank smile. \"No--not very well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because she has married you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He promptly accepted this reason. \"Well, that has a good deal to do with\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was so delightful to talk to that Maisie pursued the subject. \"But\r\n",
      "papa--HE has married Miss Overmore.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you'll see that he won't come for you at your mother's,\" that lady\r\n",
      "interposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but that won't be for a long time,\" Maisie hastened to respond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We won't talk about it now--you've months and months to put in first.\"\r\n",
      "And Sir Claude drew her closer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh that's what makes it so hard to give her up!\" Mrs. Beale made this\r\n",
      "point with her arms out to her stepdaughter. Maisie, quitting Sir\r\n",
      "Claude, went over to them and, clasped in a still tenderer embrace, felt\r\n",
      "entrancingly the extension of the field of happiness. \"I'LL come for\r\n",
      "you,\" said her stepmother, \"if Sir Claude keeps you too long: we must\r\n",
      "make him quite understand that! Don't talk to me about her ladyship!\"\r\n",
      "she went on to their visitor so familiarly that it was almost as if they\r\n",
      "must have met before. \"I know her ladyship as if I had made her. They're\r\n",
      "a pretty pair of parents!\" cried Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had so often heard them called so that the remark diverted her\r\n",
      "but an instant from the agreeable wonder of this grand new form of\r\n",
      "allusion to her mother; and that, in its turn, presently left her free\r\n",
      "to catch at the pleasant possibility, in connexion with herself, of\r\n",
      "a relation much happier as between Mrs. Beale and Sir Claude than as\r\n",
      "between mamma and papa. Still the next thing that happened was that her\r\n",
      "interest in such a relation brought to her lips a fresh question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you seen papa?\" she asked of Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the signal for their going off again, as her small stoicism had\r\n",
      "perfectly taken for granted that it would be. All that Mrs. Beale had\r\n",
      "nevertheless to add was the vague apparent sarcasm: \"Oh papa!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm assured he's not at home,\" Sir Claude replied to the child; \"but if\r\n",
      "he had been I should have hoped for the pleasure of seeing him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Won't he mind your coming?\" Maisie asked as with need of the knowledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you bad little girl!\" Mrs. Beale humorously protested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child could see that at this Sir Claude, though still moved to\r\n",
      "mirth, coloured a little; but he spoke to her very kindly. \"That's just\r\n",
      "what I came to see, you know--whether your father WOULD mind. But Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale appears strongly of the opinion that he won't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This lady promptly justified that view to her stepdaughter. \"It will be\r\n",
      "very interesting, my dear, you know, to find out what it is to-day that\r\n",
      "your father does mind. I'm sure _I_ don't know!\"--and she seemed to\r\n",
      "repeat, though with perceptible resignation, her plaint of a moment\r\n",
      "before. \"Your father, darling, is a very odd person indeed.\" She turned\r\n",
      "with this, smiling, to Sir Claude. \"But perhaps it's hardly civil for me\r\n",
      "to say that of his not objecting to have YOU in the house. If you knew\r\n",
      "some of the people he does have!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie knew them all, and none indeed were to be compared to Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "He laughed back at Mrs. Beale; he looked at such moments quite as Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix, in the long stories she told her pupil, always described the lovers\r\n",
      "of her distressed beauties--\"the perfect gentleman and strikingly\r\n",
      "handsome.\" He got up, to the child's regret, as if he were going. \"Oh I\r\n",
      "dare say we should be all right!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale once more gathered in her little charge, holding her close\r\n",
      "and looking thoughtfully over her head at their visitor. \"It's so\r\n",
      "charming--for a man of your type--to have wanted her so much!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you know about my type?\" Sir Claude laughed. \"Whatever it may\r\n",
      "be I dare say it deceives you. The truth about me is simply that I'm the\r\n",
      "most unappreciated of--what do you call the fellows?--'family-men.' Yes,\r\n",
      "I'm a family-man; upon my honour I am!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why on earth,\" cried Mrs. Beale, \"didn't you marry a\r\n",
      "family-woman?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked at her hard. \"YOU know who one marries, I think.\r\n",
      "Besides, there ARE no family-women--hanged if there are! None of them\r\n",
      "want any children--hanged if they do!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His account of the matter was most interesting, and Maisie, as if it\r\n",
      "were of bad omen for her, stared at the picture in some dismay. At the\r\n",
      "same time she felt, through encircling arms, her protectress hesitate.\r\n",
      "\"You do come out with things! But you mean her ladyship doesn't want\r\n",
      "any--really?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Won't hear of them--simply. But she can't help the one she HAS got.\"\r\n",
      "And with this Sir Claude's eyes rested on the little girl in a way that\r\n",
      "seemed to her to mask her mother's attitude with the consciousness of\r\n",
      "his own. \"She must make the best of her, don't you see? If only for the\r\n",
      "look of the thing, don't you know? one wants one's wife to take the\r\n",
      "proper line about her child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know what one wants!\" Mrs. Beale cried with a competence that\r\n",
      "evidently impressed her interlocutor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if you keep HIM up--and I dare say you've had worry enough--why\r\n",
      "shouldn't I keep Ida? What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the\r\n",
      "gander--or the other way round, don't you know? I mean to see the thing\r\n",
      "through.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, for a minute, still with her eyes on him as he leaned upon\r\n",
      "the chimneypiece, appeared to turn this over. \"You're just a wonder of\r\n",
      "kindness--that's what you are!\" she said at last. \"A lady's expected\r\n",
      "to have natural feelings. But YOUR horrible sex--! Isn't it a horrible\r\n",
      "sex, little love?\" she demanded with her cheek upon her stepdaughter's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I like gentlemen best,\" Maisie lucidly replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The words were taken up merrily. \"That's a good one for YOU!\" Sir Claude\r\n",
      "exclaimed to Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said that lady: \"I've only to remember the women she sees at her\r\n",
      "mother's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah they're very nice now,\" Sir Claude returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you call 'nice'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, they're all right.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That doesn't answer me,\" said Mrs. Beale; \"but I dare say you do take\r\n",
      "care of them. That makes you more of an angel to want this job too.\" And\r\n",
      "she playfully whacked her smaller companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not an angel--I'm an old grandmother,\" Sir Claude declared. \"I like\r\n",
      "babies--I always did. If we go to smash I shall look for a place as\r\n",
      "responsible nurse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, in her charmed mood, drank in an imputation on her years which\r\n",
      "at another moment might have been bitter; but the charm was sensibly\r\n",
      "interrupted by Mrs. Beale's screwing her round and gazing fondly into\r\n",
      "her eyes, \"You're willing to leave me, you wretch?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little girl deliberated; even this consecrated tie had become as a\r\n",
      "cord she must suddenly snap. But she snapped it very gently. \"Isn't it\r\n",
      "my turn for mamma?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're a horrible little hypocrite! The less, I think, now said about\r\n",
      "'turns' the better,\" Mrs. Beale made answer. \"_I_ know whose turn it is.\r\n",
      "You've not such a passion for your mother!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I say, I say: DO look out!\" Sir Claude quite amiably protested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's nothing she hasn't heard. But it doesn't matter--it hasn't\r\n",
      "spoiled her. If you knew what it costs me to part with you!\" she pursued\r\n",
      "to Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude watched her as she charmingly clung to the child. \"I'm so\r\n",
      "glad you really care for her. That's so much to the good.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale slowly got up, still with her hands on Maisie, but emitting a\r\n",
      "soft exhalation. \"Well, if you're glad, that may help us; for I assure\r\n",
      "you that I shall never give up any rights in her that I may consider\r\n",
      "I've acquired by my own sacrifices. I shall hold very fast to my\r\n",
      "interest in her. What seems to have happened is that she has brought you\r\n",
      "and me together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She has brought you and me together,\" said Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His cheerful echo prolonged the happy truth, and Maisie broke out almost\r\n",
      "with enthusiasm: \"I've brought you and her together!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companions of course laughed anew and Mrs. Beale gave her an\r\n",
      "affectionate shake. \"You little monster--take care what you do! But\r\n",
      "that's what she does do,\" she continued to Sir Claude. \"She did it to me\r\n",
      "and Beale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then,\" he said to Maisie, \"you must try the trick at OUR place.\"\r\n",
      "He held out his hand to her again. \"Will you come now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now--just as I am?\" She turned with an immense appeal to her\r\n",
      "stepmother, taking a leap over the mountain of \"mending,\" the abyss of\r\n",
      "packing that had loomed and yawned before her. \"Oh MAY I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale addressed her assent to Sir Claude. \"As well so as any other\r\n",
      "way. I'll send on her things to-morrow.\" Then she gave a tug to the\r\n",
      "child's coat, glancing at her up and down with some ruefulness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's not turned out as I should like--her mother will pull her to\r\n",
      "pieces. But what's one to do--with nothing to do it on? And she's better\r\n",
      "than when she came--you can tell her mother that. I'm sorry to have to\r\n",
      "say it to you--but the poor child was a sight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'll turn her out myself!\" the visitor cordially said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall like to see how!\"--Mrs. Beale appeared much amused. \"You must\r\n",
      "bring her to show me--we can manage that. Good-bye, little fright!\" And\r\n",
      "her last word to Sir Claude was that she would keep him up to the mark.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The idea of what she was to make up and the prodigious total it came\r\n",
      "to were kept well before Maisie at her mother's. These things were the\r\n",
      "constant occupation of Mrs. Wix, who arrived there by the back stairs,\r\n",
      "but in tears of joy, the day after her own arrival. The process of\r\n",
      "making up, as to which the good lady had an immense deal to say, took,\r\n",
      "through its successive phases, so long that it heralded a term at least\r\n",
      "equal to the child's last stretch with her father. This, however, was\r\n",
      "a fuller and richer time: it bounded along to the tune of Mrs. Wix's\r\n",
      "constant insistence on the energy they must both put forth. There was\r\n",
      "a fine intensity in the way the child agreed with her that under Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale and Susan Ash she had learned nothing whatever; the wildness of\r\n",
      "the rescued castaway was one of the forces that would henceforth make\r\n",
      "for a career of conquest. The year therefore rounded itself as a\r\n",
      "receptacle of retarded knowledge--a cup brimming over with the sense\r\n",
      "that now at least she was learning. Mrs. Wix fed this sense from the\r\n",
      "stores of her conversation and with the immense bustle of her reminder\r\n",
      "that they must cull the fleeting hour. They were surrounded with\r\n",
      "subjects they must take at a rush and perpetually getting into the\r\n",
      "attitude of triumphant attack. They had certainly no idle hours, and the\r\n",
      "child went to bed each night as tired as from a long day's play. This\r\n",
      "had begun from the moment of their reunion, begun with all Mrs. Wix had\r\n",
      "to tell her young friend of the reasons of her ladyship's extraordinary\r\n",
      "behaviour at the very first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It took the form of her ladyship's refusal for three days to see her\r\n",
      "little girl--three days during which Sir Claude made hasty merry dashes\r\n",
      "into the schoolroom to smooth down the odd situation, to say \"She'll\r\n",
      "come round, you know; I assure you she'll come round,\" and a little\r\n",
      "even to compensate Maisie for the indignity he had caused her to suffer.\r\n",
      "There had never in the child's life been, in all ways, such a delightful\r\n",
      "amount of reparation. It came out by his sociable admission that her\r\n",
      "ladyship had not known of his visit to her late husband's house and\r\n",
      "of his having made that person's daughter a pretext for striking up\r\n",
      "an acquaintance with the dreadful creature installed there. Heaven\r\n",
      "knew she wanted her child back and had made every plan of her own for\r\n",
      "removing her; what she couldn't for the present at least forgive any\r\n",
      "one concerned was such an officious underhand way of bringing about the\r\n",
      "transfer. Maisie carried more of the weight of this resentment than even\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix's confidential ingenuity could lighten for her, especially as\r\n",
      "Sir Claude himself was not at all ingenious, though indeed on the other\r\n",
      "hand he was not at all crushed. He was amused and intermittent and at\r\n",
      "moments most startling; he impressed on his young companion, with a\r\n",
      "frankness that agitated her much more than he seemed to guess, that he\r\n",
      "depended on her not letting her mother, when she should see her, get\r\n",
      "anything out of her about anything Mrs. Beale might have said to him. He\r\n",
      "came in and out; he professed, in joke, to take tremendous precautions;\r\n",
      "he showed a positive disposition to romp. He chaffed Mrs. Wix till she\r\n",
      "was purple with the pleasure of it, and reminded Maisie of the reticence\r\n",
      "he expected of her till she set her teeth like an Indian captive. Her\r\n",
      "lessons these first days and indeed for long after seemed to be all\r\n",
      "about Sir Claude, and yet she never really mentioned to Mrs. Wix that\r\n",
      "she was prepared, under his inspiring injunction, to be vainly tortured.\r\n",
      "This lady, however, had formulated the position of things with an\r\n",
      "acuteness that showed how little she needed to be coached. Her\r\n",
      "explanation of everything that seemed not quite pleasant--and if her own\r\n",
      "footing was perilous it met that danger as well--that her ladyship was\r\n",
      "passionately in love. Maisie accepted this hint with infinite awe and\r\n",
      "pressed upon it much when she was at last summoned into the presence of\r\n",
      "her mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There she encountered matters amid which it seemed really to help to\r\n",
      "give her a clue--an almost terrifying strangeness, full, none the less,\r\n",
      "after a little, of reverberations of Ida's old fierce and demonstrative\r\n",
      "recoveries of possession. They had been some time in the house together,\r\n",
      "and this demonstration came late. Preoccupied, however, as Maisie was\r\n",
      "with the idea of the sentiment Sir Claude had inspired, and familiar,\r\n",
      "in addition, by Mrs. Wix's anecdotes, with the ravages that in general\r\n",
      "such a sentiment could produce, she was able to make allowances for her\r\n",
      "ladyship's remarkable appearance, her violent splendour, the wonderful\r\n",
      "colour of her lips and even the hard stare, the stare of some gorgeous\r\n",
      "idol described in a story-book, that had come into her eyes in\r\n",
      "consequence of a curious thickening of their already rich circumference.\r\n",
      "Her professions and explanations were mixed with eager challenges and\r\n",
      "sudden drops, in the midst of which Maisie recognised as a memory\r\n",
      "of other years the rattle of her trinkets and the scratch of her\r\n",
      "endearments, the odour of her clothes and the jumps of her conversation.\r\n",
      "She had all her old clever way--Mrs. Wix said it was \"aristocratic\"--of\r\n",
      "changing the subject as she might have slammed the door in your face.\r\n",
      "The principal thing that was different was the tint of her golden hair,\r\n",
      "which had changed to a coppery red and, with the head it profusely\r\n",
      "covered, struck the child as now lifted still further aloft. This\r\n",
      "picturesque parent showed literally a grander stature and a nobler\r\n",
      "presence, things which, with some others that might have been\r\n",
      "bewildering, were handsomely accounted for by the romantic state of her\r\n",
      "affections. It was her affections, Maisie could easily see, that led Ida\r\n",
      "to break out into questions as to what had passed at the other house\r\n",
      "between that horrible woman and Sir Claude; but it was also just here\r\n",
      "that the little girl was able to recall the effect with which in earlier\r\n",
      "days she had practised the pacific art of stupidity. This art again came\r\n",
      "to her aid: her mother, in getting rid of her after an interview in\r\n",
      "which she had achieved a hollowness beyond her years, allowed her fully\r\n",
      "to understand she had not grown a bit more amusing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She could bear that; she could bear anything that helped her to feel she\r\n",
      "had done something for Sir Claude. If she hadn't told Mrs. Wix how Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale seemed to like him she certainly couldn't tell her ladyship. In\r\n",
      "the way the past revived for her there was a queer confusion. It was\r\n",
      "because mamma hated papa that she used to want to know bad things of\r\n",
      "him; but if at present she wanted to know the same of Sir Claude it was\r\n",
      "quite from the opposite motive. She was awestruck at the manner in which\r\n",
      "a lady might be affected through the passion mentioned by Mrs. Wix; she\r\n",
      "held her breath with the sense of picking her steps among the tremendous\r\n",
      "things of life. What she did, however, now, after the interview with\r\n",
      "her mother, impart to Mrs. Wix was that, in spite of her having had her\r\n",
      "\"good\" effect, as she called it--the effect she studied, the effect of\r\n",
      "harmless vacancy--her ladyship's last words had been that her ladyship's\r\n",
      "duty by her would be thoroughly done. Over this announcement governess\r\n",
      "and pupil looked at each other in silent profundity; but as the weeks\r\n",
      "went by it had no consequences that interfered gravely with the breezy\r\n",
      "gallop of making up. Her ladyship's duty took at times the form of not\r\n",
      "seeing her child for days together, and Maisie led her life in great\r\n",
      "prosperity between Mrs. Wix and kind Sir Claude. Mrs. Wix had a new\r\n",
      "dress and, as she was the first to proclaim, a better position; so it\r\n",
      "all struck Maisie as a crowded brilliant life, with, for the time, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale and Susan Ash simply \"left out\" like children not invited to a\r\n",
      "Christmas party. Mrs. Wix had a secret terror which, like most of her\r\n",
      "secret feelings, she discussed with her little companion, in great\r\n",
      "solemnity, by the hour: the possibility of her ladyship's coming down\r\n",
      "on them, in her sudden highbred way, with a school. But she had also\r\n",
      "a balm to this fear in a conviction of the strength of Sir Claude's\r\n",
      "grasp of the situation. He was too pleased--didn't he constantly say\r\n",
      "as much?--with the good impression made, in a wide circle, by Ida's\r\n",
      "sacrifices; and he came into the schoolroom repeatedly to let them know\r\n",
      "how beautifully he felt everything had gone off and everything would go\r\n",
      "on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He disappeared at times for days, when his patient friends understood\r\n",
      "that her ladyship would naturally absorb him; but he always came back\r\n",
      "with the drollest stories of where he had been, a wonderful picture of\r\n",
      "society, and even with pretty presents that showed how in absence he\r\n",
      "thought of his home. Besides giving Mrs. Wix by his conversation a sense\r\n",
      "that they almost themselves \"went out,\" he gave her a five-pound note\r\n",
      "and the history of France and an umbrella with a malachite knob, and to\r\n",
      "Maisie both chocolate-creams and story-books, besides a lovely greatcoat\r\n",
      "(which he took her out all alone to buy) and ever so many games\r\n",
      "in boxes, with printed directions, and a bright red frame for the\r\n",
      "protection of his famous photograph. The games were, as he said, to\r\n",
      "while away the evening hour; and the evening hour indeed often passed\r\n",
      "in futile attempts on Mrs. Wix's part to master what \"it said\" on the\r\n",
      "papers. When he asked the pair how they liked the games they always\r\n",
      "replied \"Oh immensely!\" but they had earnest discussions as to whether\r\n",
      "they hadn't better appeal to him frankly for aid to understand them.\r\n",
      "This was a course their delicacy shrank from; they couldn't have told\r\n",
      "exactly why, but it was a part of their tenderness for him not to let\r\n",
      "him think they had trouble. What dazzled most was his kindness to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix, not only the five-pound note and the \"not forgetting\" her, but\r\n",
      "the perfect consideration, as she called it with an air to which her\r\n",
      "sounding of the words gave the only grandeur Maisie was to have seen her\r\n",
      "wear save on a certain occasion hereafter to be described, an occasion\r\n",
      "when the poor lady was grander than all of them put together. He shook\r\n",
      "hands with her, he recognised her, as she said, and above all, more than\r\n",
      "once, he took her, with his stepdaughter, to the pantomime and, in the\r\n",
      "crowd, coming out, publicly gave her his arm. When he met them in sunny\r\n",
      "Piccadilly he made merry and turned and walked with them, heroically\r\n",
      "suppressing his consciousness of the stamp of his company, a heroism\r\n",
      "that--needless for Mrs. Wix to sound THOSE words--her ladyship, though\r\n",
      "a blood-relation, was little enough the woman to be capable of. Even to\r\n",
      "the hard heart of childhood there was something tragic in such elation\r\n",
      "at such humanities: it brought home to Maisie the way her humble\r\n",
      "companion had sidled and ducked through life. But it settled the\r\n",
      "question of the degree to which Sir Claude was a gentleman: he was\r\n",
      "more of one than anybody else in the world--\"I don't care,\" Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "repeatedly remarked, \"whom you may meet in grand society, nor even to\r\n",
      "whom you may be contracted in marriage.\" There were questions that\r\n",
      "Maisie never asked; so her governess was spared the embarrassment of\r\n",
      "telling her if he were more of a gentleman than papa. This was not\r\n",
      "moreover from the want of opportunity, for there were no moments between\r\n",
      "them at which the topic could be irrelevant, no subject they were going\r\n",
      "into, not even the principal dates or the auxiliary verbs, in which it\r\n",
      "was further off than the turn of the page. The answer on the winter\r\n",
      "nights to the puzzle of cards and counters and little bewildering\r\n",
      "pamphlets was just to draw up to the fire and talk about him; and if the\r\n",
      "truth must be told this edifying interchange constituted for the time\r\n",
      "the little girl's chief education.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It must also be admitted that he took them far, further perhaps than\r\n",
      "was always warranted by the old-fashioned conscience, the dingy\r\n",
      "decencies, of Maisie's simple instructress. There were hours when Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix sighingly testified to the scruples she surmounted, seemed to ask\r\n",
      "what other line one COULD take with a young person whose experience\r\n",
      "had been, as it were, so peculiar. \"It isn't as if you didn't already\r\n",
      "know everything, is it, love?\" and \"I can't make you any worse than\r\n",
      "you ARE, can I, darling?\"--these were the terms in which the good lady\r\n",
      "justified to herself and her pupil her pleasant conversational ease.\r\n",
      "What the pupil already knew was indeed rather taken for granted than\r\n",
      "expressed, but it performed the useful function of transcending all\r\n",
      "textbooks and supplanting all studies. If the child couldn't be worse\r\n",
      "it was a comfort even to herself that she was bad--a comfort offering\r\n",
      "a broad firm support to the fundamental fact of the present crisis:\r\n",
      "the fact that mamma was fearfully jealous. This was another side\r\n",
      "of the circumstance of mamma's passion, and the deep couple in the\r\n",
      "schoolroom were not long in working round to it. It brought them face\r\n",
      "to face with the idea of the inconvenience suffered by any lady who\r\n",
      "marries a gentleman producing on other ladies the charming effect of\r\n",
      "Sir Claude. That such ladies wouldn't be able to help falling in love\r\n",
      "with him was a reflexion naturally irritating to his wife. One day\r\n",
      "when some accident, some crash of a banged door or some scurry of\r\n",
      "a scared maid, had rendered this truth particularly vivid, Maisie,\r\n",
      "receptive and profound, suddenly said to her companion: \"And you, my\r\n",
      "dear, are you in love with him too?\" Even her profundity had left\r\n",
      "a margin for a laugh; so she was a trifle startled by the solemn\r\n",
      "promptitude with which Mrs. Wix plumped out: \"Over head and ears.\r\n",
      "I've NEVER since you ask me, been so far gone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This boldness had none the less no effect of deterrence for her when, a\r\n",
      "few days later--it was because several had elapsed without a visit from\r\n",
      "Sir Claude--her governess turned the tables. \"May I ask you, miss, if\r\n",
      "YOU are?\" Mrs. Wix brought it out, she could see, with hesitation, but\r\n",
      "clearly intending a joke. \"Why RATHER!\" the child made answer, as if in\r\n",
      "surprise at not having long ago seemed sufficiently to commit herself;\r\n",
      "on which her friend gave a sigh of apparent satisfaction. It might in\r\n",
      "fact have expressed positive relief. Everything was as it should be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet it was not with them, they were very sure, that her ladyship was\r\n",
      "furious, nor because she had forbidden it that there befell at last a\r\n",
      "period--six months brought it round--when for days together he scarcely\r\n",
      "came near them. He was \"off,\" and Ida was \"off,\" and they were sometimes\r\n",
      "off together and sometimes apart; there were seasons when the simple\r\n",
      "students had the house to themselves, when the very servants seemed\r\n",
      "also to be \"off\" and dinner became a reckless forage in pantries and\r\n",
      "sideboards. Mrs. Wix reminded her disciple on such occasions--hungry\r\n",
      "moments often, when all the support of the reminder was required--that\r\n",
      "the \"real life\" of their companions, the brilliant society in which it\r\n",
      "was inevitable they should move and the complicated pleasures in which\r\n",
      "it was almost presumptuous of the mind to follow them, must offer\r\n",
      "features literally not to be imagined without being seen. At one\r\n",
      "of these times Maisie found her opening it out that, though the\r\n",
      "difficulties were many, it was Mrs. Beale who had now become the chief.\r\n",
      "Then somehow it was brought fully to the child's knowledge that her\r\n",
      "stepmother had been making attempts to see her, that her mother had\r\n",
      "deeply resented it, that her stepfather had backed her stepmother up,\r\n",
      "that the latter had pretended to be acting as the representative of her\r\n",
      "father, and that her mother took the whole thing, in plain terms, very\r\n",
      "hard. The situation was, as Mrs. Wix declared, an extraordinary muddle\r\n",
      "to be sure. Her account of it brought back to Maisie the happy vision of\r\n",
      "the way Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale had made acquaintance--an incident to\r\n",
      "which, with her stepfather, though she had had little to say about it\r\n",
      "to Mrs. Wix, she had during the first weeks of her stay at her mother's\r\n",
      "found more than one opportunity to revert. As to what had taken place\r\n",
      "the day Sir Claude came for her, she had been vaguely grateful to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix for not attempting, as her mother had attempted, to put her through.\r\n",
      "That was what Sir Claude had called the process when he warned her of\r\n",
      "it, and again afterwards when he told her she was an awfully good \"chap\"\r\n",
      "for having foiled it. Then it was that, well aware Mrs. Beale hadn't\r\n",
      "in the least really given her up, she had asked him if he remained\r\n",
      "in communication with her and if for the time everything must really\r\n",
      "be held to be at an end between her stepmother and herself. This\r\n",
      "conversation had occurred in consequence of his one day popping into the\r\n",
      "schoolroom and finding Maisie alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "X\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was smoking a cigarette and he stood before the fire and looked\r\n",
      "at the meagre appointments of the room in a way that made her rather\r\n",
      "ashamed of them. Then before (on the subject of Mrs. Beale) he let her\r\n",
      "\"draw\" him--that was another of his words; it was astonishing how many\r\n",
      "she gathered in--he remarked that really mamma kept them rather low on\r\n",
      "the question of decorations. Mrs. Wix had put up a Japanese fan and two\r\n",
      "rather grim texts; she had wished they were gayer, but they were all she\r\n",
      "happened to have. Without Sir Claude's photograph, however, the place\r\n",
      "would have been, as he said, as dull as a cold dinner. He had said\r\n",
      "as well that there were all sorts of things they ought to have; yet\r\n",
      "governess and pupil, it had to be admitted, were still divided between\r\n",
      "discussing the places where any sort of thing would look best if any\r\n",
      "sort of thing should ever come and acknowledging that mutability in the\r\n",
      "child's career which was naturally unfavourable to accumulation. She\r\n",
      "stayed long enough only to miss things, not half long enough to deserve\r\n",
      "them. The way Sir Claude looked about the schoolroom had made her feel\r\n",
      "with humility as if it were not very different from the shabby attic in\r\n",
      "which she had visited Susan Ash. Then he had said in abrupt reference to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale: \"Do you think she really cares for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh awfully!\" Maisie had replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, I mean, does she love you for yourself, as they call it, don't you\r\n",
      "know? Is she as fond of you, now, as Mrs. Wix?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child turned it over. \"Oh I'm not every bit Mrs. Beale has!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude seemed much amused at this. \"No; you're not every bit she\r\n",
      "has!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed for some moments, but that was an old story to Maisie, who\r\n",
      "was not too much disconcerted to go on: \"But she'll never give me up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I won't either, old boy: so that's not so wonderful, and she's\r\n",
      "not the only one. But if she's so fond of you, why doesn't she write to\r\n",
      "you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh on account of mamma.\" This was rudimentary, and she was almost\r\n",
      "surprised at the simplicity of Sir Claude's question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see--that's quite right,\" he answered. \"She might get at you--there\r\n",
      "are all sorts of ways. But of course there's Mrs. Wix.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's Mrs. Wix,\" Maisie lucidly concurred. \"Mrs. Wix can't abide\r\n",
      "her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude seemed interested. \"Oh she can't abide her? Then what does\r\n",
      "she say about her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing at all--because she knows I shouldn't like it. Isn't it sweet\r\n",
      "of her?\" the child asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly; rather nice. Mrs. Beale wouldn't hold her tongue for any\r\n",
      "such thing as that, would she?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie remembered how little she had done so; but she desired to protect\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale too. The only protection she could think of, however, was the\r\n",
      "plea: \"Oh at papa's, you know, they don't mind!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this Sir Claude only smiled. \"No, I dare say not. But here we mind,\r\n",
      "don't we?--we take care what we say. I don't suppose it's a matter on\r\n",
      "which I ought to prejudice you,\" he went on; \"but I think we must on the\r\n",
      "whole be rather nicer here than at your father's. However, I don't press\r\n",
      "that; for it's the sort of question on which it's awfully awkward for\r\n",
      "you to speak. Don't worry, at any rate: I assure you I'll back you up.\"\r\n",
      "Then after a moment and while he smoked he reverted to Mrs. Beale and\r\n",
      "the child's first enquiry. \"I'm afraid we can't do much for her just\r\n",
      "now. I haven't seen her since that day--upon my word I haven't seen\r\n",
      "her.\" The next instant, with a laugh the least bit foolish, the young\r\n",
      "man slightly coloured: he must have felt this profession of innocence to\r\n",
      "be excessive as addressed to Maisie. It was inevitable to say to her,\r\n",
      "however, that of course her mother loathed the lady of the other house.\r\n",
      "He couldn't go there again with his wife's consent, and he wasn't the\r\n",
      "man--he begged her to believe, falling once more, in spite of himself,\r\n",
      "into the scruple of showing the child he didn't trip--to go there\r\n",
      "without it. He was liable in talking with her to take the tone of her\r\n",
      "being also a man of the world. He had gone to Mrs. Beale's to fetch\r\n",
      "away Maisie, but that was altogether different. Now that she was in\r\n",
      "her mother's house what pretext had he to give her mother for paying\r\n",
      "calls on her father's wife? And of course Mrs. Beale couldn't come to\r\n",
      "Ida's--Ida would tear her limb from limb. Maisie, with this talk of\r\n",
      "pretexts, remembered how much Mrs. Beale had made of her being a good\r\n",
      "one, and how, for such a function, it was her fate to be either much\r\n",
      "depended on or much missed. Sir Claude moreover recognised on this\r\n",
      "occasion that perhaps things would take a turn later on; and he wound\r\n",
      "up by saying: \"I'm sure she does sincerely care for you--how can she\r\n",
      "possibly help it? She's very young and very pretty and very clever: I\r\n",
      "think she's charming. But we must walk very straight. If you'll help me,\r\n",
      "you know, I'll help YOU,\" he concluded in the pleasant fraternising,\r\n",
      "equalising, not a bit patronising way which made the child ready to go\r\n",
      "through anything for him and the beauty of which, as she dimly felt, was\r\n",
      "that it was so much less a deceitful descent to her years than a real\r\n",
      "indifference to them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It gave her moments of secret rapture--moments of believing she might\r\n",
      "help him indeed. The only mystification in this was the imposing time of\r\n",
      "life that her elders spoke of as youth. For Sir Claude then Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "was \"young,\" just as for Mrs. Wix Sir Claude was: that was one of the\r\n",
      "merits for which Mrs. Wix most commended him. What therefore was Maisie\r\n",
      "herself, and, in another relation to the matter, what therefore was\r\n",
      "mamma? It took her some time to puzzle out with the aid of an experiment\r\n",
      "or two that it wouldn't do to talk about mamma's youth. She even went\r\n",
      "so far one day, in the presence of that lady's thick colour and marked\r\n",
      "lines, as to wonder if it would occur to any one but herself to do so.\r\n",
      "Yet if she wasn't young then she was old; and this threw an odd light on\r\n",
      "her having a husband of a different generation. Mr. Farange was still\r\n",
      "older--that Maisie perfectly knew; and it brought her in due course\r\n",
      "to the perception of how much more, since Mrs. Beale was younger than\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, papa must be older than Mrs. Beale. Such discoveries were\r\n",
      "disconcerting and even a trifle confounding: these persons, it appeared,\r\n",
      "were not of the age they ought to be. This was somehow particularly\r\n",
      "the case with mamma, and the fact made her reflect with some relief on\r\n",
      "her not having gone with Mrs. Wix into the question of Sir Claude's\r\n",
      "attachment to his wife. She was conscious that in confining their\r\n",
      "attention to the state of her ladyship's own affections they had been\r\n",
      "controlled--Mrs. Wix perhaps in especial--by delicacy and even by\r\n",
      "embarrassment. The end of her colloquy with her stepfather in the\r\n",
      "schoolroom was her saying: \"Then if we're not to see Mrs. Beale at all\r\n",
      "it isn't what she seemed to think when you came for me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked rather blank. \"What did she seem to think?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why that I've brought you together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She thought that?\" Sir Claude asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie was surprised at his already forgetting it. \"Just as I had\r\n",
      "brought papa and her. Don't you remember she said so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It came back to Sir Claude in a peal of laughter. \"Oh yes--she said so!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And YOU said so,\" Maisie lucidly pursued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He recovered, with increasing mirth, the whole occasion. \"And YOU said\r\n",
      "so!\" he retorted as if they were playing a game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then were we all mistaken?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He considered a little. \"No, on the whole not. I dare say it's just what\r\n",
      "you HAVE done. We ARE together--it's really most odd. She's thinking of\r\n",
      "us--of you and me--though we don't meet. And I've no doubt you'll find\r\n",
      "it will be all right when you go back to her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Am I going back to her?\" Maisie brought out with a little gasp which\r\n",
      "was like a sudden clutch of the happy present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It appeared to make Sir Claude grave a moment; it might have made him\r\n",
      "feel the weight of the pledge his action had given. \"Oh some day, I\r\n",
      "suppose! We've plenty of time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've such a tremendous lot to make up,\" Maisie said with a sense of\r\n",
      "great boldness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, and you must make up every hour of it. Oh I'll SEE that you\r\n",
      "do!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was encouraging; and to show cheerfully that she was reassured she\r\n",
      "replied: \"That's what Mrs. Wix sees too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" said Sir Claude; \"Mrs. Wix and I are shoulder to shoulder.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie took in a little this strong image; after which she exclaimed:\r\n",
      "\"Then I've done it also to you and her--I've brought YOU together!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Blest if you haven't!\" Sir Claude laughed. \"And more, upon my word,\r\n",
      "than any of the lot. Oh you've done for US! Now if you could--as I\r\n",
      "suggested, you know, that day--only manage me and your mother!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child wondered. \"Bring you and HER together?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see we're not together--not a bit. But I oughtn't to tell you such\r\n",
      "things; all the more that you won't really do it--not you. No, old\r\n",
      "chap,\" the young man continued; \"there you'll break down. But it won't\r\n",
      "matter--we'll rub along. The great thing is that you and I are all\r\n",
      "right.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"WE'RE all right!\" Maisie echoed devoutly. But the next moment, in the\r\n",
      "light of what he had just said, she asked: \"How shall I ever leave you?\"\r\n",
      "It was as if she must somehow take care of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His smile did justice to her anxiety. \"Oh well, you needn't! It won't\r\n",
      "come to that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean that when I do go you'll go with me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude cast about. \"Not exactly 'with' you perhaps; but I shall\r\n",
      "never be far off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how do you know where mamma may take you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed again. \"I don't, I confess!\" Then he had an idea, though\r\n",
      "something too jocose. \"That will be for you to see--that she shan't take\r\n",
      "me too far.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can I help it?\" Maisie enquired in surprise. \"Mamma doesn't care\r\n",
      "for me,\" she said very simply. \"Not really.\" Child as she was, her\r\n",
      "little long history was in the words; and it was as impossible to\r\n",
      "contradict her as if she had been venerable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude's silence was an admission of this, and still more the tone\r\n",
      "in which he presently replied: \"That won't prevent her from--some time\r\n",
      "or other--leaving me with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then we'll live together?\" she eagerly demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm afraid,\" said Sir Claude, smiling, \"that that will be Mrs. Beale's\r\n",
      "real chance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her eagerness just slightly dropped at this; she remembered Mrs. Wix's\r\n",
      "pronouncement that it was all an extraordinary muddle. \"To take me\r\n",
      "again? Well, can't you come to see me there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I dare say!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though there were parts of childhood Maisie had lost she had all\r\n",
      "childhood's preference for the particular promise. \"Then you WILL\r\n",
      "come--you'll come often, won't you?\" she insisted; while at the moment\r\n",
      "she spoke the door opened for the return of Mrs. Wix. Sir Claude\r\n",
      "hereupon, instead of replying, gave her a look which left her silent\r\n",
      "and embarrassed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he again found privacy convenient, however--which happened to be\r\n",
      "long in coming--he took up their conversation very much where it had\r\n",
      "dropped. \"You see, my dear, if I shall be able to go to you at your\r\n",
      "father's it yet isn't at all the same thing for Mrs. Beale to come to\r\n",
      "you here.\" Maisie gave a thoughtful assent to this proposition, though\r\n",
      "conscious she could scarcely herself say just where the difference would\r\n",
      "lie. She felt how much her stepfather saved her, as he said with his\r\n",
      "habitual amusement, the trouble of that. \"I shall probably be able to go\r\n",
      "to Mrs. Beale's without your mother's knowing it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie stared with a certain thrill at the dramatic element in this.\r\n",
      "\"And she couldn't come here without mamma's--\" She was unable to\r\n",
      "articulate the word for what mamma would do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child, Mrs. Wix would tell of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I thought,\" Maisie objected, \"that Mrs. Wix and you--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are such brothers-in-arms?\"--Sir Claude caught her up. \"Oh yes, about\r\n",
      "everything but Mrs. Beale. And if you should suggest,\" he went on, \"that\r\n",
      "we might somehow or other hide her peeping in from Mrs. Wix--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't suggest THAT!\" Maisie in turn cut him short.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked as if he could indeed quite see why. \"No; it would\r\n",
      "really be impossible.\" There came to her from this glance at what they\r\n",
      "might hide the first small glimpse of something in him that she wouldn't\r\n",
      "have expected. There had been times when she had had to make the best\r\n",
      "of the impression that she was herself deceitful; yet she had never\r\n",
      "concealed anything bigger than a thought. Of course she now concealed\r\n",
      "this thought of how strange it would be to see HIM hide; and while she\r\n",
      "was so actively engaged he continued: \"Besides, you know, I'm not afraid\r\n",
      "of your father.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you are of my mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "It must not be supposed that her ladyship's intermissions were not\r\n",
      "qualified by demonstrations of another order--triumphal entries and\r\n",
      "breathless pauses during which she seemed to take of everything in the\r\n",
      "room, from the state of the ceiling to that of her daughter's boot-toes,\r\n",
      "a survey that was rich in intentions. Sometimes she sat down and\r\n",
      "sometimes she surged about, but her attitude wore equally in either\r\n",
      "case the grand air of the practical. She found so much to deplore that\r\n",
      "she left a great deal to expect, and bristled so with calculation that\r\n",
      "she seemed to scatter remedies and pledges. Her visits were as good as\r\n",
      "an outfit; her manner, as Mrs. Wix once said, as good as a pair of\r\n",

      "sometimes Sir Claude was with her, and during all the earlier period\r\n",
      "there was nothing on which these appearances had had so delightful a\r\n",
      "bearing as on the way her ladyship was, as Mrs. Wix expressed it, under\r\n",
      "the spell. \"But ISN'T she under it!\" Maisie used in thoughtful but\r\n",
      "familiar reference to exclaim after Sir Claude had swept mamma away in\r\n",
      "peals of natural laughter. Not even in the old days of the convulsed\r\n",
      "ladies had she heard mamma laugh so freely as in these moments of\r\n",
      "conjugal surrender, to the gaiety of which even a little girl could see\r\n",
      "she had at last a right--a little girl whose thoughtfulness was now all\r\n",
      "happy selfish meditation on good omens and future fun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unaccompanied, in subsequent hours, and with an effect of changing\r\n",
      "to meet a change, Ida took a tone superficially disconcerting and\r\n",
      "abrupt--the tone of having, at an immense cost, made over everything to\r\n",
      "Sir Claude and wishing others to know that if everything wasn't right it\r\n",
      "was because Sir Claude was so dreadfully vague. \"He has made from the\r\n",
      "first such a row about you,\" she said on one occasion to Maisie, \"that\r\n",
      "I've told him to do for you himself and try how he likes it--see?\r\n",
      "I've washed my hands of you; I've made you over to him; and if you're\r\n",
      "discontented it's on him, please, you'll come down. So don't haul poor\r\n",
      "ME up--I assure you I've worries enough.\" One of these, visibly, was\r\n",
      "that the spell rejoiced in by the schoolroom fire was already in danger\r\n",
      "of breaking; another was that she was finally forced to make no secret\r\n",
      "of her husband's unfitness for real responsibilities. The day came\r\n",
      "indeed when her breathless auditors learnt from her in bewilderment that\r\n",
      "what ailed him was that he was, alas, simply not serious. Maisie wept\r\n",
      "on Mrs. Wix's bosom after hearing that Sir Claude was a butterfly;\r\n",
      "considering moreover that her governess but half-patched it up in coming\r\n",
      "out at various moments the next few days with the opinion that it was\r\n",
      "proper to his \"station\" to be careless and free. That had been proper to\r\n",
      "every one's station that she had yet encountered save poor Mrs. Wix's\r\n",
      "own, and the particular merit of Sir Claude had seemed precisely that he\r\n",
      "was different from every one. She talked with him, however, as time went\r\n",
      "on, very freely about her mother; being with him, in this relation,\r\n",
      "wholly without the fear that had kept her silent before her father--the\r\n",
      "fear of bearing tales and making bad things worse. He appeared to accept\r\n",
      "the idea that he had taken her over and made her, as he said, his\r\n",
      "particular lark; he quite agreed also that he was an awful fraud and an\r\n",
      "idle beast and a sorry dunce. And he never said a word to her against\r\n",
      "her mother--he only remained dumb and discouraged in the face of her\r\n",
      "ladyship's own overtopping earnestness. There were occasions when he\r\n",
      "even spoke as if he had wrenched his little charge from the arms of a\r\n",
      "parent who had fought for her tooth and nail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the very moral of a scene that flashed into vividness one day\r\n",
      "when the four happened to meet without company in the drawing-room and\r\n",
      "Maisie found herself clutched to her mother's breast and passionately\r\n",
      "sobbed and shrieked over, made the subject of a demonstration evidently\r\n",
      "sequent to some sharp passage just enacted. The connexion required that\r\n",
      "while she almost cradled the child in her arms Ida should speak of her\r\n",
      "as hideously, as fatally estranged, and should rail at Sir Claude as the\r\n",
      "cruel author of the outrage. \"He has taken you FROM me,\" she cried; \"he\r\n",
      "has set you AGAINST me, and you've been won away and your horrid little\r\n",
      "mind has been poisoned! You've gone over to him, you've given yourself\r\n",
      "up to side against me and hate me. You never open your mouth to me--you\r\n",
      "know you don't; and you chatter to him like a dozen magpies. Don't lie\r\n",
      "about it--I hear you all over the place. You hang about him in a way\r\n",
      "that's barely decent--he can do what he likes with you. Well then, let\r\n",
      "him, to his heart's content: he has been in such a hurry to take you\r\n",
      "that we'll see if it suits him to keep you. I'm very good to break my\r\n",
      "heart about it when you've no more feeling for me than a clammy little\r\n",
      "fish!\" She suddenly thrust the child away and, as a disgusted admission\r\n",
      "of failure, sent her flying across the room into the arms of Mrs. Wix,\r\n",
      "whom at this moment and even in the whirl of her transit Maisie saw,\r\n",
      "very red, exchange a quick queer look with Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The impression of the look remained with her, confronting her with such\r\n",
      "a critical little view of her mother's explosion that she felt the less\r\n",
      "ashamed of herself for incurring the reproach with which she had been\r\n",
      "cast off. Her father had once called her a heartless little beast,\r\n",
      "and now, though decidedly scared, she was as stiff and cold as if the\r\n",
      "description had been just. She was not even frightened enough to cry,\r\n",
      "which would have been a tribute to her mother's wrongs: she was only,\r\n",
      "more than anything else, curious about the opinion mutely expressed by\r\n",
      "their companions. Taking the earliest opportunity to question Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "on this subject she elicited the remarkable reply: \"Well, my dear, it's\r\n",
      "her ladyship's game, and we must just hold on like grim death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie could interpret at her leisure these ominous words. Her\r\n",
      "reflexions indeed at this moment thickened apace, and one of them made\r\n",
      "her sure that her governess had conversations, private, earnest and not\r\n",
      "infrequent, with her denounced stepfather. She perceived in the light\r\n",
      "of a second episode that something beyond her knowledge had taken place\r\n",
      "in the house. The things beyond her knowledge--numerous enough in\r\n",
      "truth--had not hitherto, she believed, been the things that had been\r\n",
      "nearest to her: she had even had in the past a small smug conviction\r\n",
      "that in the domestic labyrinth she always kept the clue. This time too,\r\n",
      "however, she at last found out--with the discreet aid, it had to be\r\n",
      "confessed, of Mrs. Wix. Sir Claude's own assistance was abruptly taken\r\n",
      "from her, for his comment on her ladyship's game was to start on the\r\n",
      "spot, quite alone, for Paris, evidently because he wished to show\r\n",
      "a spirit when accused of bad behaviour. He might be fond of his\r\n",
      "stepdaughter, Maisie felt, without wishing her to be after all thrust on\r\n",
      "him in such a way; his absence therefore, it was clear, was a protest\r\n",
      "against the thrusting. It was while this absence lasted that our young\r\n",
      "lady finally discovered what had happened in the house to be that her\r\n",
      "mother was no longer in love.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The limit of a passion for Sir Claude had certainly been reached, she\r\n",
      "judged, some time before the day on which her ladyship burst suddenly\r\n",
      "into the schoolroom to introduce Mr. Perriam, who, as she announced\r\n",
      "from the doorway to Maisie, wouldn't believe his ears that one had a\r\n",
      "great hoyden of a daughter. Mr. Perriam was short and massive--Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix remarked afterwards that he was \"too fat for the pace\"; and it\r\n",
      "would have been difficult to say of him whether his head were more\r\n",
      "bald or his black moustache more bushy. He seemed also to have\r\n",
      "moustaches over his eyes, which, however, by no means prevented these\r\n",
      "polished little globes from rolling round the room as if they had been\r\n",
      "billiard-balls impelled by Ida's celebrated stroke. Mr. Perriam wore\r\n",
      "on the hand that pulled his moustache a diamond of dazzling lustre, in\r\n",
      "consequence of which and of his general weight and mystery our young\r\n",
      "lady observed on his departure that if he had only had a turban he\r\n",
      "would have been quite her idea of a heathen Turk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's quite my idea,\" Mrs. Wix replied, \"of a heathen Jew.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I mean,\" said Maisie, \"of a person who comes from the East.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's where he MUST come from,\" her governess opined--\"he comes from\r\n",
      "the City.\" In a moment she added as if she knew all about him. \"He's one\r\n",
      "of those people who have lately broken out. He'll be immensely rich.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the death of his papa?\" the child interestedly enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear no--nothing hereditary. I mean he has made a mass of money.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How much, do you think?\" Maisie demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix reflected and sketched it. \"Oh many millions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A hundred?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix was not sure of the number, but there were enough of them to\r\n",
      "have seemed to warm up for the time the penury of the schoolroom--to\r\n",
      "linger there as an afterglow of the hot heavy light Mr. Perriam sensibly\r\n",
      "shed. This was also, no doubt, on his part, an effect of that enjoyment\r\n",
      "of life with which, among her elders, Maisie had been in contact from\r\n",
      "her earliest years--the sign of happy maturity, the old familiar note of\r\n",
      "overflowing cheer. \"How d'ye do, ma'am? How d'ye do, little miss?\"--he\r\n",
      "laughed and nodded at the gaping figures. \"She has brought me up for a\r\n",
      "peep--it's true I wouldn't take you on trust. She's always talking about\r\n",
      "you, but she'd never produce you; so to-day I challenged her on the\r\n",
      "spot. Well, you ain't a myth, my dear--I back down on that,\" the visitor\r\n",
      "went on to Maisie; \"nor you either, miss, though you might be, to be\r\n",
      "sure!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I bored him with you, darling--I bore every one,\" Ida said, \"and to\r\n",
      "prove that you ARE a sweet thing, as well as a fearfully old one, I told\r\n",
      "him he could judge for himself. So now he sees that you're a dreadful\r\n",
      "bouncing business and that your poor old Mummy's at least sixty!\"--and\r\n",
      "her ladyship smiled at Mr. Perriam with the charm that her daughter had\r\n",
      "heard imputed to her at papa's by the merry gentlemen who had so often\r\n",
      "wished to get from him what they called a \"rise.\" Her manner at that\r\n",
      "instant gave the child a glimpse more vivid than any yet enjoyed of the\r\n",
      "attraction that papa, in remarkable language, always denied she could\r\n",
      "put forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Perriam, however, clearly recognised it in the humour with which he\r\n",
      "met her. \"I never said you ain't wonderful--did I ever say it, hey?\" and\r\n",
      "he appealed with pleasant confidence to the testimony of the schoolroom,\r\n",
      "about which itself also he evidently felt something might be expected of\r\n",
      "him. \"So this is their little place, hey? Charming, charming, charming!\"\r\n",
      "he repeated as he vaguely looked round. The interrupted students clung\r\n",
      "together as if they had been personally exposed; but Ida relieved their\r\n",
      "embarrassment by a hunch of her high shoulders. This time the smile she\r\n",
      "addressed to Mr. Perriam had a beauty of sudden sadness. \"What on earth\r\n",
      "is a poor woman to do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitor's grimace grew more marked as he continued to look, and\r\n",
      "the conscious little schoolroom felt still more like a cage at a\r\n",
      "menagerie. \"Charming, charming, charming!\" Mr. Perriam insisted; but\r\n",
      "the parenthesis closed with a prompt click. \"There you are!\" said her\r\n",
      "ladyship. \"By-bye!\" she sharply added. The next minute they were on the\r\n",
      "stairs, and Mrs. Wix and her companion, at the open door and looking\r\n",
      "mutely at each other, were reached by the sound of the large social\r\n",
      "current that carried them back to their life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was singular perhaps after this that Maisie never put a question\r\n",
      "about Mr. Perriam, and it was still more singular that by the end of a\r\n",
      "week she knew all she didn't ask. What she most particularly knew--and\r\n",
      "the information came to her, unsought, straight from Mrs. Wix--was that\r\n",
      "Sir Claude wouldn't at all care for the visits of a millionaire who was\r\n",
      "in and out of the upper rooms. How little he would care was proved by\r\n",
      "the fact that under the sense of them Mrs. Wix's discretion broke down\r\n",
      "altogether; she was capable of a transfer of allegiance, capable, at the\r\n",
      "altar of propriety, of a desperate sacrifice of her ladyship. As against\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, she more than once intimated, she had been willing to do\r\n",
      "the best for her, but as against Sir Claude she could do nothing for\r\n",
      "her at all. It was extraordinary the number of things that, still\r\n",
      "without a question, Maisie knew by the time her stepfather came back\r\n",
      "from Paris--came bringing her a splendid apparatus for painting in\r\n",
      "water-colours and bringing Mrs. Wix, by a lapse of memory that would\r\n",
      "have been droll if it had not been a trifle disconcerting, a second and\r\n",
      "even a more elegant umbrella. He had forgotten all about the first,\r\n",
      "with which, buried in as many wrappers as a mummy of the Pharaohs, she\r\n",
      "wouldn't for the world have done anything so profane as use it. Maisie\r\n",
      "knew above all that though she was now, by what she called an informal\r\n",
      "understanding, on Sir Claude's \"side,\" she had yet not uttered a word\r\n",
      "to him about Mr. Perriam. That gentleman became therefore a kind of\r\n",
      "flourishing public secret, out of the depths of which governess and\r\n",
      "pupil looked at each other portentously from the time their friend was\r\n",
      "restored to them. He was restored in great abundance, and it was marked\r\n",
      "that, though he appeared to have felt the need to take a stand against\r\n",
      "the risk of being too roughly saddled with the offspring of others, he\r\n",
      "at this period exposed himself more than ever before to the presumption\r\n",
      "of having created expectations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If it had become now, for that matter, a question of sides, there was at\r\n",
      "least a certain amount of evidence as to where they all were. Maisie of\r\n",
      "course, in such a delicate position, was on nobody's; but Sir Claude had\r\n",
      "all the air of being on hers. If therefore Mrs. Wix was on Sir Claude's,\r\n",
      "her ladyship on Mr. Perriam's and Mr. Perriam presumably on her\r\n",
      "ladyship's, this left only Mrs. Beale and Mr. Farange to account for.\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale clearly was, like Sir Claude, on Maisie's, and papa, it was\r\n",
      "to be supposed, on Mrs. Beale's. Here indeed was a slight ambiguity,\r\n",
      "as papa's being on Mrs. Beale's didn't somehow seem to place him quite\r\n",
      "on his daughter's. It sounded, as this young lady thought it over,\r\n",
      "very much like puss-in-the-corner, and she could only wonder if the\r\n",
      "distribution of parties would lead to a rushing to and fro and a\r\n",
      "changing of places. She was in the presence, she felt, of restless\r\n",
      "change: wasn't it restless enough that her mother and her stepfather\r\n",
      "should already be on different sides? That was the great thing that had\r\n",
      "domestically happened. Mrs. Wix, besides, had turned another face: she\r\n",
      "had never been exactly gay, but her gravity was now an attitude as\r\n",
      "public as a posted placard. She seemed to sit in her new dress and brood\r\n",
      "over her lost delicacy, which had become almost as doleful a memory as\r\n",
      "that of poor Clara Matilda. \"It IS hard for him,\" she often said to her\r\n",
      "companion; and it was surprising how competent on this point Maisie\r\n",
      "was conscious of being to agree with her. Hard as it was, however, Sir\r\n",
      "Claude had never shown to greater advantage than in the gallant generous\r\n",
      "sociable way he carried it off: a way that drew from Mrs. Wix a hundred\r\n",
      "expressions of relief at his not having suffered it to embitter him.\r\n",
      "It threw him more and more at last into the schoolroom, where he\r\n",
      "had plainly begun to recognise that if he was to have the credit of\r\n",
      "perverting the innocent child he might also at least have the amusement.\r\n",
      "He never came into the place without telling its occupants that they\r\n",
      "were the nicest people in the house--a remark which always led them to\r\n",
      "say to each other \"Mr. Perriam!\" as loud as ever compressed lips and\r\n",
      "enlarged eyes could make them articulate. He caused Maisie to remember\r\n",
      "what she had said to Mrs. Beale about his having the nature of a good\r\n",
      "nurse, and, rather more than she intended before Mrs. Wix, to bring the\r\n",
      "whole thing out by once remarking to him that none of her good nurses\r\n",
      "had smoked quite so much in the nursery. This had no more effect than\r\n",
      "it was meant to on his cigarettes: he was always smoking, but always\r\n",
      "declaring that it was death to him not to lead a domestic life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He led one after all in the schoolroom, and there were hours of late\r\n",
      "evening, when she had gone to bed, that Maisie knew he sat there talking\r\n",
      "with Mrs. Wix of how to meet his difficulties. His consideration for\r\n",
      "this unfortunate woman even in the midst of them continued to show him\r\n",
      "as the perfect gentleman and lifted the subject of his courtesy into an\r\n",
      "upper air of beatitude in which her very pride had the hush of anxiety.\r\n",
      "\"He leans on me--he leans on me!\" she only announced from time to time;\r\n",
      "and she was more surprised than amused when, later on, she accidentally\r\n",
      "found she had given her pupil the impression of a support literally\r\n",
      "supplied by her person. This glimpse of a misconception led her to be\r\n",
      "explicit--to put before the child, with an air of mourning indeed for\r\n",
      "such a stoop to the common, that what they talked about in the small\r\n",
      "hours, as they said, was the question of his taking right hold of life.\r\n",
      "The life she wanted him to take right hold of was the public: \"she\"\r\n",
      "being, I hasten to add, in this connexion, not the mistress of his fate,\r\n",
      "but only Mrs. Wix herself. She had phrases about him that were full of\r\n",
      "easy understanding, yet full of morality. \"He's a wonderful nature, but\r\n",
      "he can't live like the lilies. He's all right, you know, but he must\r\n",
      "have a high interest.\" She had more than once remarked that his affairs\r\n",
      "were sadly involved, but that they must get him--Maisie and she\r\n",
      "together apparently--into Parliament. The child took it from her with a\r\n",
      "flutter of importance that Parliament was his natural sphere, and she\r\n",
      "was the less prepared to recognise a hindrance as she had never heard\r\n",
      "of any affairs whatever that were not involved. She had in the old\r\n",
      "days once been told by Mrs. Beale that her very own were, and with the\r\n",
      "refreshment of knowing that she HAD affairs the information hadn't in\r\n",
      "the least overwhelmed her. It was true and perhaps a little alarming\r\n",
      "that she had never heard of any such matters since then. Full of\r\n",
      "charm at any rate was the prospect of some day getting Sir Claude in;\r\n",
      "especially after Mrs. Wix, as the fruit of more midnight colloquies,\r\n",
      "once went so far as to observe that she really believed it was all\r\n",
      "that was wanted to save him. This critic, with these words, struck her\r\n",
      "disciple as cropping up, after the manner of mamma when mamma talked,\r\n",
      "quite in a new place. The child stared as at the jump of a kangaroo.\r\n",
      "\"Save him from what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix debated, then covered a still greater distance. \"Why just from\r\n",
      "awful misery.\"\r\n",

      "She had not at the moment explained her ominous speech, but the light of\r\n",
      "remarkable events soon enabled her companion to read it. It may indeed\r\n",
      "be said that these days brought on a high quickening of Maisie's direct\r\n",
      "perceptions, of her sense of freedom to make out things for herself.\r\n",
      "This was helped by an emotion intrinsically far from sweet--the increase\r\n",
      "of the alarm that had most haunted her meditations. She had no need to\r\n",
      "be told, as on the morrow of the revelation of Sir Claude's danger she\r\n",

      "it came back to her from Mrs. Beale--with two fathers, two mothers and\r\n",
      "two homes, six protections in all, she shouldn't know \"wherever\" to\r\n",
      "go. Such apprehension as she felt on this score was not diminished\r\n",
      "by the fact that Mrs. Wix herself was suddenly white with terror: a\r\n",
      "circumstance leading Maisie to the further knowledge that this lady\r\n",
      "was still more scared on her own behalf than on that of her pupil. A\r\n",
      "governess who had only one frock was not likely to have either two\r\n",
      "fathers or two mothers: accordingly if even with these resources Maisie\r\n",
      "was to be in the streets, where in the name of all that was dreadful\r\n",
      "was poor Mrs. Wix to be? She had had, it appeared, a tremendous brush\r\n",
      "with Ida, which had begun and ended with the request that she would be\r\n",
      "pleased on the spot to \"bundle.\" It had come suddenly but completely,\r\n",
      "this signal of which she had gone in fear. The companions confessed to\r\n",
      "each other the dread each had hidden the worst of, but Mrs. Wix was\r\n",
      "better off than Maisie in having a plan of defence. She declined indeed\r\n",
      "to communicate it till it was quite mature; but meanwhile, she hastened\r\n",
      "to declare, her feet were firm in the schoolroom. They could only be\r\n",
      "loosened by force: she would \"leave\" for the police perhaps, but she\r\n",
      "wouldn't leave for mere outrage. That would be to play her ladyship's\r\n",
      "game, and it would take another turn of the screw to make her desert her\r\n",
      "darling. Her ladyship had come down with extraordinary violence: it had\r\n",
      "been one of many symptoms of a situation strained--\"between them all,\"\r\n",
      "as Mrs. Wix said, \"but especially between the two\"--to the point of God\r\n",
      "only knew what.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her description of the crisis made the child blanch. \"Between which\r\n",
      "two?--papa and mamma?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear no. I mean between your mother and HIM.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, in this, recognised an opportunity to be really deep.\r\n",
      "\"'Him'?--Mr. Perriam?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She fairly brought a blush to the scared face. \"Well, my dear, I must\r\n",
      "say what you DON'T know ain't worth mentioning. That it won't go on for\r\n",
      "ever with Mr. Perriam--since I MUST meet you--you can suppose? But I\r\n",
      "meant dear Sir Claude.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie stood corrected rather than abashed. \"I see. But it's about Mr.\r\n",
      "Perriam he's angry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix waited. \"He says he's not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not angry? He has told you so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix looked at her hard. \"Not about HIM!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then about some one else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix looked at her harder. \"About some one else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord Eric?\" the child promptly brought forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this, of a sudden, her governess was more agitated. \"Oh why, little\r\n",
      "unfortunate, should we discuss their dreadful names?\"--and she threw\r\n",
      "herself for the millionth time on Maisie's neck. It took her pupil but\r\n",
      "a moment to feel that she quivered with insecurity, and, the contact\r\n",
      "of her terror aiding, the pair in another instant were sobbing in each\r\n",
      "other's arms. Then it was that, completely relaxed, demoralised as she\r\n",
      "had never been, Mrs. Wix suffered her wound to bleed and her resentment\r\n",
      "to gush. Her great bitterness was that Ida had called her false,\r\n",
      "denounced her hypocrisy and duplicity, reviled her spying and tattling,\r\n",
      "her lying and grovelling to Sir Claude. \"Me, ME!\" the poor woman wailed,\r\n",
      "\"who've seen what I've seen and gone through everything only to cover\r\n",
      "her up and ease her off and smooth her down? If I've been an 'ipocrite\r\n",
      "it's the other way round: I've pretended, to him and to her, to myself\r\n",
      "and to you and to every one, NOT to see! It serves me right to have held\r\n",
      "my tongue before such horrors!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What horrors they were her companion forbore too closely to enquire,\r\n",
      "showing even signs not a few of an ability to take them for granted.\r\n",
      "That put the couple more than ever, in this troubled sea, in the same\r\n",
      "boat, so that with the consciousness of ideas on the part of her fellow\r\n",
      "mariner Maisie could sit close and wait. Sir Claude on the morrow came\r\n",
      "in to tea, and then the ideas were produced. It was extraordinary how\r\n",
      "the child's presence drew out their full strength. The principal one was\r\n",
      "startling, but Maisie appreciated the courage with which her governess\r\n",
      "handled it. It simply consisted of the proposal that whenever and\r\n",
      "wherever they should seek refuge Sir Claude should consent to share\r\n",
      "their asylum. On his protesting with all the warmth in nature against\r\n",
      "this note of secession she asked what else in the world was left to them\r\n",
      "if her ladyship should stop supplies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Supplies be hanged, my dear woman!\" said their delightful friend.\r\n",
      "\"Leave supplies to me--I'll take care of supplies.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix rose to it. \"Well, it's exactly because I knew you'd be so glad\r\n",
      "to do so that I put the question before you. There's a way to look after\r\n",
      "us better than any other. The way's just to come along with us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It hung before Maisie, Mrs. Wix's way, like a glittering picture, and\r\n",
      "she clasped her hands in ecstasy. \"Come along, come along, come along!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked from his stepdaughter back to her governess. \"Do you\r\n",
      "mean leave this house and take up my abode with you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It will be the right thing--if you feel as you've told me you feel.\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix, sustained and uplifted, was now as clear as a bell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude had the air of trying to recall what he had told her; then\r\n",
      "the light broke that was always breaking to make his face more pleasant.\r\n",
      "\"It's your happy thought that I shall take a house for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For the wretched homeless child. Any roof--over OUR heads--will do for\r\n",
      "us; but of course for you it will have to be something really nice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude's eyes reverted to Maisie, rather hard, as she thought; and\r\n",
      "there was a shade in his very smile that seemed to show her--though she\r\n",
      "also felt it didn't show Mrs. Wix--that the accommodation prescribed\r\n",
      "must loom to him pretty large. The next moment, however, he laughed\r\n",
      "gaily enough. \"My dear lady, you exaggerate tremendously MY poor little\r\n",
      "needs.\" Mrs. Wix had once mentioned to her young friend that when Sir\r\n",
      "Claude called her his dear lady he could do anything with her; and\r\n",
      "Maisie felt a certain anxiety to see what he would do now. Well, he only\r\n",
      "addressed her a remark of which the child herself was aware of feeling\r\n",
      "the force. \"Your plan appeals to me immensely; but of course--don't you\r\n",
      "see--I shall have to consider the position I put myself in by leaving my\r\n",
      "wife.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll also have to remember,\" Mrs. Wix replied, \"that if you don't\r\n",
      "look out your wife won't give you time to consider. Her ladyship will\r\n",
      "leave YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah my good friend, I do look out!\" the young man returned while Maisie\r\n",
      "helped herself afresh to bread and butter. \"Of course if that happens I\r\n",
      "shall have somehow to turn round; but I hope with all my heart it won't.\r\n",
      "I beg your pardon,\" he continued to his stepdaughter, \"for appearing to\r\n",
      "discuss that sort of possibility under your sharp little nose. But the\r\n",
      "fact is I FORGET half the time that Ida's your sainted mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So do I!\" said Maisie, her mouth full of bread and butter and to put\r\n",
      "him the more in the right.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her protectress, at this, was upon her again. \"The little desolate\r\n",
      "precious pet!\" For the rest of the conversation she was enclosed in Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix's arms, and as they sat there interlocked Sir Claude, before them\r\n",
      "with his tea-cup, looked down at them in deepening thought. Shrink\r\n",
      "together as they might they couldn't help, Maisie felt, being a very\r\n",
      "large lumpish image of what Mrs. Wix required of his slim fineness.\r\n",
      "She knew moreover that this lady didn't make it better by adding in a\r\n",
      "moment: \"Of course we shouldn't dream of a whole house. Any sort of\r\n",
      "little lodging, however humble, would be only too blest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it would have to be something that would hold us all,\" said Sir\r\n",
      "Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" Mrs. Wix concurred; \"the whole point's our being together.\r\n",
      "While you're waiting, before you act, for her ladyship to take some\r\n",
      "step, our position here will come to an impossible pass. You don't\r\n",
      "know what I went through with her for you yesterday--and for our poor\r\n",
      "darling; but it's not a thing I can promise you often to face again. She\r\n",
      "cast me out in horrible language--she has instructed the servants not to\r\n",
      "wait on me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh the poor servants are all right!\" Sir Claude eagerly cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're certainly better than their mistress. It's too dreadful that I\r\n",
      "should sit here and say of your wife, Sir Claude, and of Maisie's own\r\n",
      "mother, that she's lower than a domestic; but my being betrayed into\r\n",
      "such remarks is just a reason the more for our getting away. I shall\r\n",
      "stay till I'm taken by the shoulders, but that may happen any day. What\r\n",
      "also may perfectly happen, you must permit me to repeat, is that she'll\r\n",
      "go off to get rid of us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh if she'll only do that!\" Sir Claude laughed. \"That would be the very\r\n",
      "making of us!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't say it--don't say it!\" Mrs. Wix pleaded. \"Don't speak of anything\r\n",
      "so fatal. You know what I mean. We must all cling to the right. You\r\n",
      "mustn't be bad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude set down his tea-cup; he had become more grave and he\r\n",
      "pensively wiped his moustache. \"Won't all the world say I'm awful if I\r\n",
      "leave the house before--before she has bolted? They'll say it was my\r\n",
      "doing so that made her bolt.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie could grasp the force of this reasoning, but it offered no check\r\n",
      "to Mrs. Wix. \"Why need you mind that--if you've done it for so high a\r\n",
      "motive? Think of the beauty of it,\" the good lady pressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of bolting with YOU?\" Sir Claude ejaculated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She faintly smiled--she even faintly coloured. \"So far from doing you\r\n",
      "harm it will do you the highest good. Sir Claude, if you'll listen to\r\n",
      "me, it will save you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Save me from what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, at this question, waited with renewed suspense for an answer\r\n",
      "that would bring the thing to some finer point than their companion\r\n",
      "had brought it to before. But there was on the contrary only more\r\n",
      "mystification in Mrs. Wix's reply. \"Ah from you know what!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean from some other woman!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--from a real bad one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude at least, the child could see, was not mystified; so little\r\n",
      "indeed that a smile of intelligence broke afresh in his eyes. He turned\r\n",
      "them in vague discomfort to Maisie, and then something in the way she\r\n",
      "met them caused him to chuck her playfully under the chin. It was not\r\n",
      "till after this that he good-naturedly met Mrs. Wix. \"You think me much\r\n",
      "worse than I am.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If that were true,\" she returned, \"I wouldn't appeal to you. I do, Sir\r\n",
      "Claude, in the name of all that's good in you--and oh so earnestly! We\r\n",
      "can help each other. What you'll do for our young friend here I needn't\r\n",
      "say. That isn't even what I want to speak of now. What I want to speak\r\n",
      "of is what you'll GET--don't you see?--from such an opportunity to take\r\n",
      "hold. Take hold of US--take hold of HER. Make her your duty--make her\r\n",
      "your life: she'll repay you a thousand-fold!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was to Mrs. Wix, during this appeal, that Maisie's contemplation\r\n",
      "transferred itself: partly because, though her heart was in her throat\r\n",
      "for trepidation, her delicacy deterred her from appearing herself to\r\n",
      "press the question; partly from the coercion of seeing Mrs. Wix come out\r\n",
      "as Mrs. Wix had never come before--not even on the day of her call at\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale's with the news of mamma's marriage. On that day Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "had surpassed her in dignity, but nobody could have surpassed her now.\r\n",
      "There was in fact at this moment a fascination for her pupil in the hint\r\n",
      "she seemed to give that she had still more of that surprise behind. So\r\n",
      "the sharpened sense of spectatorship was the child's main support, the\r\n",
      "long habit, from the first, of seeing herself in discussion and finding\r\n",
      "in the fury of it--she had had a glimpse of the game of football--a sort\r\n",
      "of compensation for the doom of a peculiar passivity. It gave her often\r\n",
      "an odd air of being present at her history in as separate a manner as if\r\n",
      "she could only get at experience by flattening her nose against a pane\r\n",
      "of glass. Such she felt to be the application of her nose while she\r\n",
      "waited for the effect of Mrs. Wix's eloquence. Sir Claude, however,\r\n",
      "didn't keep her long in a position so ungraceful: he sat down and opened\r\n",
      "his arms to her as he had done the day he came for her at her father's,\r\n",
      "and while he held her there, looking at her kindly, but as if their\r\n",
      "companion had brought the blood a good deal to his face, he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear Mrs. Wix is magnificent, but she's rather too grand about it.\r\n",
      "I mean the situation isn't after all quite so desperate or quite so\r\n",
      "simple. But I give you my word before her, and I give it to her before\r\n",
      "you, that I'll never, never, forsake you. Do you hear that, old fellow,\r\n",
      "and do you take it in? I'll stick to you through everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie did take it in--took it with a long tremor of all her little\r\n",
      "being; and then as, to emphasise it, he drew her closer she buried her\r\n",
      "head on his shoulder and cried without sound and without pain. While she\r\n",
      "was so engaged she became aware that his own breast was agitated, and\r\n",
      "gathered from it with rapture that his tears were as silently flowing.\r\n",
      "Presently she heard a loud sob from Mrs. Wix--Mrs. Wix was the only one\r\n",
      "who made a noise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was to have made, for some time, none other but this, though\r\n",
      "within a few days, in conversation with her pupil, she described her\r\n",
      "intercourse with Ida as little better than the state of being battered.\r\n",
      "There was as yet nevertheless no attempt to eject her by force, and she\r\n",
      "recognised that Sir Claude, taking such a stand as never before, had\r\n",
      "intervened with passion and with success. As Maisie remembered--and\r\n",
      "remembered wholly without disdain--that he had told her he was afraid of\r\n",
      "her ladyship, the little girl took this act of resolution as a proof of\r\n",
      "what, in the spirit of the engagement sealed by all their tears, he was\r\n",
      "really prepared to do. Mrs. Wix spoke to her of the pecuniary sacrifice\r\n",
      "by which she herself purchased the scant security she enjoyed and which,\r\n",
      "if it was a defence against the hand of violence, yet left her exposed\r\n",
      "to incredible rudeness. Didn't her ladyship find every hour of the\r\n",
      "day some artful means to humiliate and trample upon her? There was a\r\n",
      "quarter's salary owing her--a great name, even Maisie could suspect,\r\n",
      "for a small matter; she should never see it as long as she lived, but\r\n",
      "keeping quiet about it put her ladyship, thank heaven, a little in one's\r\n",
      "power. Now that he was doing so much else she could never have the\r\n",
      "grossness to apply for it to Sir Claude. He had sent home for schoolroom\r\n",
      "consumption a huge frosted cake, a wonderful delectable mountain with\r\n",
      "geological strata of jam, which might, with economy, see them through\r\n",
      "many days of their siege; but it was none the less known to Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "that his affairs were more and more involved, and her fellow partaker\r\n",
      "looked back tenderly, in the light of these involutions, at the\r\n",
      "expression of face with which he had greeted the proposal that he should\r\n",
      "set up another establishment. Maisie felt that if their maintenance\r\n",
      "should hang by a thread they must still demean themselves with the\r\n",
      "highest delicacy. What he was doing was simply acting without delay, so\r\n",
      "far as his embarrassments permitted, on the inspiration of his elder\r\n",
      "friend. There was at this season a wonderful month of May--as soft as a\r\n",
      "drop of the wind in a gale that had kept one awake--when he took out his\r\n",
      "stepdaughter with a fresh alacrity and they rambled the great town in\r\n",
      "search, as Mrs. Wix called it, of combined amusement and instruction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They rode on the top of 'buses; they visited outlying parks; they went\r\n",
      "to cricket-matches where Maisie fell asleep; they tried a hundred places\r\n",
      "for the best one to have tea. This was his direct way of rising to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix's grand lesson--of making his little accepted charge his duty and\r\n",
      "his life. They dropped, under incontrollable impulses, into shops that\r\n",
      "they agreed were too big, to look at things that they agreed were too\r\n",
      "small, and it was during these hours that Mrs. Wix, alone at home, but\r\n",
      "a subject of regretful reference as they pulled off their gloves for\r\n",
      "refreshment, subsequently described herself as least sheltered from the\r\n",
      "blows her ladyship had achieved such ingenuity in dealing. She again\r\n",
      "and again repeated that she wouldn't so much have minded having her\r\n",
      "\"attainments\" held up to scorn and her knowledge of every subject\r\n",
      "denied, hadn't she been branded as \"low\" in character and tone. There\r\n",
      "was by this time no pretence on the part of any one of denying it to be\r\n",
      "fortunate that her ladyship habitually left London every Saturday and\r\n",
      "was more and more disposed to a return late in the week. It was almost\r\n",
      "equally public that she regarded as a preposterous \"pose,\" and indeed as\r\n",
      "a direct insult to herself, her husband's attitude of staying behind to\r\n",
      "look after a child for whom the most elaborate provision had been made.\r\n",
      "If there was a type Ida despised, Sir Claude communicated to Maisie, it\r\n",
      "was the man who pottered about town of a Sunday; and he also mentioned\r\n",
      "how often she had declared to him that if he had a grain of spirit\r\n",
      "he would be ashamed to accept a menial position about Mr. Farange's\r\n",
      "daughter. It was her ladyship's contention that he was in craven fear\r\n",
      "of his predecessor--otherwise he would recognise it as an obligation of\r\n",
      "plain decency to protect his wife against the outrage of that person's\r\n",
      "barefaced attempt to swindle her. The swindle was that Mr. Farange\r\n",
      "put upon her the whole intolerable burden; \"and even when I pay for\r\n",
      "you myself,\" Sir Claude averred to his young friend, \"she accuses me\r\n",
      "the more of truckling and grovelling.\" It was Mrs. Wix's conviction,\r\n",
      "they both knew, arrived at on independent grounds, that Ida's weekly\r\n",
      "excursions were feelers for a more considerable absence. If she came\r\n",
      "back later each week the week would be sure to arrive when she wouldn't\r\n",

      "two umbrellas unsociable and the wanderers had sought shelter in the\r\n",
      "National Gallery--Maisie sat beside him staring rather sightlessly at a\r\n",
      "roomful of pictures which he had mystified her much by speaking of with\r\n",
      "a bored sigh as a \"silly superstition.\" They represented, with patches\r\n",
      "of gold and cataracts of purple, with stiff saints and angular angels,\r\n",
      "with ugly Madonnas and uglier babies, strange prayers and prostrations;\r\n",
      "so that she at first took his words for a protest against devotional\r\n",
      "idolatry--all the more that he had of late often come with her and\r\n",
      "with Mrs. Wix to morning church, a place of worship of Mrs. Wix's own\r\n",
      "choosing, where there was nothing of that sort; no haloes on heads,\r\n",
      "but only, during long sermons, beguiling backs of bonnets, and where,\r\n",
      "as her governess always afterwards observed, he gave the most earnest\r\n",
      "attention. It presently appeared, however, that his reference was merely\r\n",
      "to the affectation of admiring such ridiculous works--an admonition that\r\n",
      "she received from him as submissively as she received everything. What\r\n",
      "turn it gave to their talk needn't here be recorded: the transition to\r\n",
      "the colourless schoolroom and lonely Mrs. Wix was doubtless an effect of\r\n",
      "relaxed interest in what was before them. Maisie expressed in her own\r\n",
      "way the truth that she never went home nowadays without expecting to\r\n",
      "find the temple of her studies empty and the poor priestess cast out.\r\n",
      "This conveyed a full appreciation of her peril, and it was in rejoinder\r\n",
      "that Sir Claude uttered, acknowledging the source of that peril, the\r\n",
      "reassurance at which I have glanced. \"Don't be afraid, my dear: I've\r\n",
      "squared her.\" It required indeed a supplement when he saw that it left\r\n",
      "the child momentarily blank. \"I mean that your mother lets me do what I\r\n",
      "want so long as I let her do what SHE wants.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Again she considered. \"Then, please, what may it be?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wouldn't tell you for the whole world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She gazed at a gaunt Madonna; after which she broke into a slow smile.\r\n",
      "\"Well, I don't care, so long as you do let her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh you monster!\"--and Sir Claude's gay vehemence brought him to his\r\n",
      "feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another day, in another place--a place in Baker Street where at a hungry\r\n",
      "hour she had sat down with him to tea and buns--he brought out a question\r\n",
      "disconnected from previous talk. \"I say, you know, what do you suppose\r\n",
      "your father WOULD do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie hadn't long to cast about or to question his pleasant eyes. \"If\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" the child hastened to respond. \"You've told me you're\r\n",
      "not afraid of him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The question is are you?\" said Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie candidly considered; then she spoke resolutely. \"No, not of\r\n",
      "papa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But of somebody else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, of lots of people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of your mother first and foremost of course.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear, yes; more of mamma than of--than of--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Than of what?\" Sir Claude asked as she hesitated for a comparison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought over all objects of dread. \"Than of a wild elephant!\" she at\r\n",
      "last declared. \"And you are too,\" she reminded him as he laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I am too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again she meditated. \"Why then did you marry her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just because I WAS afraid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Even when she loved you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That made her the more alarming.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For Maisie herself, though her companion seemed to find it droll, this\r\n",
      "opened up depths of gravity. \"More alarming than she is now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, in a different way. Fear, unfortunately, is a very big thing, and\r\n",
      "there's a great variety of kinds.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She took this in with complete intelligence. \"Then I think I've got them\r\n",
      "all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You?\" her friend cried. \"Nonsense! You're thoroughly 'game.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm awfully afraid of Mrs. Beale,\" Maisie objected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his smooth brows. \"That charming woman?\"\r\n",

      "\"Well,\" she answered, \"you can't understand it because you're not in the\r\n",
      "same state.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had been going on with a luminous \"But\" when, across the table, he\r\n",
      "laid his hand on her arm. \"I CAN understand it,\" he confessed. \"I AM in\r\n",
      "the same state.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh but she likes you so!\" Maisie promptly pleaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude literally coloured. \"That has something to do with it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie wondered again. \"Being liked with being afraid?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, when it amounts to adoration.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why aren't you afraid of ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because with you it amounts to that?\" He had kept his hand on her arm.\r\n",
      "\"Well, what prevents is simply that you're the gentlest spirit on earth.\r\n",
      "Besides--\" he pursued; but he came to a pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Besides--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I SHOULD be in fear if you were older--there! See--you already make me\r\n",
      "talk nonsense,\" the young man added. \"The question's about your father.\r\n",
      "Is he likewise afraid of Mrs. Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think not. And yet he loves her,\" Maisie mused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no--he doesn't; not a bit!\" After which, as his companion stared,\r\n",
      "Sir Claude apparently felt that he must make this oddity fit with her\r\n",
      "recollections. \"There's nothing of that sort NOW.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Maisie only stared the more. \"They've changed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like your mother and me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She wondered how he knew. \"Then you've seen Mrs. Beale again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He demurred. \"Oh no. She has written to me,\" he presently subjoined.\r\n",
      "\"SHE'S not afraid of your father either. No one at all is--really.\"\r\n",
      "Then he went on while Maisie's little mind, with its filial spring\r\n",
      "too relaxed from of old for a pang at this want of parental majesty,\r\n",
      "speculated on the vague relation between Mrs. Beale's courage and the\r\n",
      "question, for Mrs. Wix and herself, of a neat lodging with their friend.\r\n",
      "\"She wouldn't care a bit if Mr. Farange should make a row.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean about you and me and Mrs. Wix? Why should she care? It\r\n",
      "wouldn't hurt HER.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, with his legs out and his hand diving into his\r\n",
      "trousers-pocket, threw back his head with a laugh just perceptibly\r\n",
      "tempered, as she thought, by a sigh. \"My dear stepchild, you're\r\n",
      "delightful! Look here, we must pay. You've had five buns?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How CAN you?\" Maisie demanded, crimson under the eye of the young woman\r\n",
      "who had stepped to their board. \"I've had three.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shortly after this Mrs. Wix looked so ill that it was to be feared her\r\n",
      "ladyship had treated her to some unexampled passage. Maisie asked if\r\n",
      "anything worse than usual had occurred; whereupon the poor woman brought\r\n",
      "out with infinite gloom: \"He has been seeing Mrs. Beale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir Claude?\" The child remembered what he had said. \"Oh no--not SEEING\r\n",
      "her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon. I absolutely know it.\" Mrs. Wix was as positive as\r\n",
      "she was dismal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie nevertheless ventured to challenge her. \"And how, please, do you\r\n",
      "know it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She faltered a moment. \"From herself. I've been to see her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then on Maisie's visible surprise: \"I went yesterday while you were out\r\n",
      "with him. He has seen her repeatedly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not wholly clear to Maisie why Mrs. Wix should be prostrate at\r\n",
      "this discovery; but her general consciousness of the way things could be\r\n",
      "both perpetrated and resented always eased off for her the strain of the\r\n",
      "particular mystery. \"There may be some mistake. He says he hasn't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix turned paler, as if this were a still deeper ground for alarm.\r\n",
      "\"He says so?--he denies that he has seen her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He told me so three days ago. Perhaps she's mistaken,\" Maisie\r\n",
      "suggested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean perhaps she lies? She lies whenever it suits her, I'm very\r\n",
      "sure. But I know when people lie--and that's what I've loved in you,\r\n",
      "that YOU never do. Mrs. Beale didn't yesterday at any rate. He HAS seen\r\n",
      "her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie was silent a little. \"He says not,\" she then repeated.\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps--perhaps--\" Once more she paused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean perhaps HE lies?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gracious goodness, no!\" Maisie shouted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix's bitterness, however, again overflowed. \"He does, he does,\"\r\n",
      "she cried, \"and it's that that's just the worst of it! They'll take\r\n",
      "you, they'll take you, and what in the world will then become of me?\"\r\n",
      "She threw herself afresh upon her pupil and wept over her with the\r\n",
      "inevitable effect of causing the child's own tears to flow. But Maisie\r\n",
      "couldn't have told you if she had been crying at the image of their\r\n",
      "separation or at that of Sir Claude's untruth. As regards this deviation\r\n",
      "it was agreed between them that they were not in a position to bring it\r\n",
      "home to him. Mrs. Wix was in dread of doing anything to make him, as\r\n",
      "she said, \"worse\"; and Maisie was sufficiently initiated to be able to\r\n",
      "reflect that in speaking to her as he had done he had only wished to be\r\n",
      "tender of Mrs. Beale. It fell in with all her inclinations to think of\r\n",
      "him as tender, and she forbore to let him know that the two ladies had,\r\n",
      "as SHE would never do, betrayed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had not long to keep her secret, for the next day, when she went\r\n",
      "out with him, he suddenly said in reference to some errand he had first\r\n",
      "proposed: \"No, we won't do that--we'll do something else.\" On this, a\r\n",
      "few steps from the door, he stopped a hansom and helped her in; then\r\n",
      "following her he gave the driver over the top an address that she lost.\r\n",
      "When he was seated beside her she asked him where they were going; to\r\n",
      "which he replied \"My dear child, you'll see.\" She saw while she watched\r\n",
      "and wondered that they took the direction of the Regent's Park; but\r\n",
      "she didn't know why he should make a mystery of that, and it was not\r\n",
      "till they passed under a pretty arch and drew up at a white house\r\n",
      "in a terrace from which the view, she thought, must be lovely that,\r\n",
      "mystified, she clutched him and broke out: \"I shall see papa?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked down at her with a kind smile. \"No, probably not. I haven't\r\n",
      "brought you for that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then whose house is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's your father's. They've moved here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked about: she had known Mr. Farange in four or five houses, and\r\n",
      "there was nothing astonishing in this except that it was the nicest\r\n",
      "place yet. \"But I shall see Mrs. Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's to see her that I brought you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stared, very white, and, with her hand on his arm, though they had\r\n",
      "stopped, kept him sitting in the cab. \"To leave me, do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could scarce bring it out. \"It's not for me to say if you CAN stay.\r\n",
      "We must look into it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But if I do I shall see papa?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh some time or other, no doubt.\" Then Sir Claude went on: \"Have you\r\n",
      "really so very great a dread of that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie glanced away over the apron of the cab--gazed a minute at the\r\n",
      "green expanse of the Regent's Park and, at this moment colouring to the\r\n",
      "roots of her hair, felt the full, hot rush of an emotion more mature\r\n",
      "than any she had yet known. It consisted of an odd unexpected shame at\r\n",
      "placing in an inferior light, to so perfect a gentleman and so charming\r\n",
      "a person as Sir Claude, so very near a relative as Mr. Farange. She\r\n",
      "remembered, however, her friend's telling her that no one was seriously\r\n",
      "afraid of her father, and she turned round with a small toss of her\r\n",
      "head. \"Oh I dare say I can manage him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude smiled, but she noted that the violence with which she had\r\n",
      "just changed colour had brought into his own face a slight compunctious\r\n",
      "and embarrassed flush. It was as if he had caught his first glimpse of\r\n",
      "her sense of responsibility. Neither of them made a movement to get out,\r\n",
      "and after an instant he said to her: \"Look here, if you say so we won't\r\n",
      "after all go in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah but I want to see Mrs. Beale!\" the child gently wailed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what if she does decide to take you? Then, you know, you'll have to\r\n",
      "remain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie turned it over. \"Straight on--and give you up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--I don't quite know about giving me up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean as I gave up Mrs. Beale when I last went to mamma's. I couldn't\r\n",
      "do without you here for anything like so long a time as that.\" It struck\r\n",
      "her as a hundred years since she had seen Mrs. Beale, who was on the\r\n",
      "other side of the door they were so near and whom she yet had not taken\r\n",
      "the jump to clasp in her arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I dare say you'll see more of me than you've seen of Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "It isn't in ME to be so beautifully discreet,\" Sir Claude said. \"But\r\n",
      "all the same,\" he continued, \"I leave the thing, now that we're here,\r\n",
      "absolutely WITH you. You must settle it. We'll only go in if you say so.\r\n",
      "If you don't say so we'll turn right round and drive away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So in that case Mrs. Beale won't take me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--not by any act of ours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I shall be able to go on with mamma?\" Maisie asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't say that!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She considered. \"But I thought you said you had squared her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude poked his stick at the splashboard of the cab. \"Not, my dear\r\n",
      "child, to the point she now requires.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then if she turns me out and I don't come here--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude promptly took her up. \"What do I offer you, you naturally\r\n",
      "enquire? My poor chick, that's just what I ask myself. I don't see it,\r\n",
      "I confess, quite as straight as Mrs. Wix.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion gazed a moment at what Mrs. Wix saw. \"You mean WE can't\r\n",
      "make a little family?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's very base of me, no doubt, but I can't wholly chuck your mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, at this, emitted a low but lengthened sigh, a slight sound of\r\n",
      "reluctant assent which would certainly have been amusing to an auditor.\r\n",
      "\"Then there isn't anything else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I vow I don't quite see what there is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie waited; her silence seemed to signify that she too had no\r\n",
      "alternative to suggest. But she made another appeal. \"If I come here\r\n",
      "you'll come to see me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I won't lose sight of you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how often will you come?\" As he hung fire she pressed him. \"Often\r\n",
      "and often?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still he faltered. \"My dear old woman--\" he began. Then he paused again,\r\n",
      "going on the next moment with a change of tone. \"You're too funny! Yes\r\n",
      "then,\" he said; \"often and often.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right!\" Maisie jumped out. Mrs. Beale was at home, but not in the\r\n",
      "drawing-room, and when the butler had gone for her the child suddenly\r\n",
      "broke out: \"But when I'm here what will Mrs. Wix do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah you should have thought of that sooner!\" said her companion with the\r\n",

      "acquaintance, somehow recalled more familiarity than Maisie could feel.\r\n",
      "A rich strong expressive affection in short pounced upon her in the\r\n",
      "shape of a handsomer, ampler, older Mrs. Beale. It was like making a\r\n",
      "fine friend, and they hadn't been a minute together before she felt\r\n",
      "elated at the way she had met the choice imposed on her in the cab.\r\n",
      "There was a whole future in the combination of Mrs. Beale's beauty and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale's hug. She seemed to Maisie charming to behold, and also to\r\n",
      "have no connexion at all with anybody who had once mended underclothing\r\n",
      "and had meals in the nursery. The child knew one of her father's wives\r\n",
      "was a woman of fashion, but she had always dimly made a distinction, not\r\n",
      "applying that epithet without reserve to the other. Mrs. Beale had since\r\n",
      "their separation acquired a conspicuous right to it, and Maisie's first\r\n",
      "flush of response to her present delight coloured all her splendour with\r\n",
      "meanings that this time were sweet. She had told Sir Claude she was\r\n",
      "afraid of the lady in the Regent's Park; but she had confidence enough\r\n",
      "to break on the spot, into the frankest appreciation. \"Why, aren't you\r\n",
      "beautiful? Isn't she beautiful, Sir Claude, ISN'T she?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The handsomest woman in London, simply,\" Sir Claude gallantly replied.\r\n",
      "\"Just as sure as you're the best little girl!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, the handsomest woman in London gave herself up, with tender\r\n",
      "lustrous looks and every demonstration of fondness, to a happiness at\r\n",
      "last clutched again. There was almost as vivid a bloom in her maturity\r\n",
      "as in mamma's, and it took her but a short time to give her little\r\n",
      "friend an impression of positive power--an impression that seemed to\r\n",
      "begin like a long bright day. This was a perception on Maisie's part\r\n",
      "that neither mamma, nor Sir Claude, nor Mrs. Wix, with their immense and\r\n",
      "so varied respective attractions, had exactly kindled, and that made an\r\n",
      "immediate difference when the talk, as it promptly did, began to turn to\r\n",
      "her father. Oh yes, Mr. Farange was a complication, but she saw now that\r\n",
      "he wouldn't be one for his daughter. For Mrs. Beale certainly he was an\r\n",
      "immense one--she speedily made known as much; but Mrs. Beale from this\r\n",
      "moment presented herself to Maisie as a person to whom a great gift had\r\n",
      "come. The great gift was just for handling complications. Maisie felt\r\n",
      "how little she made of them when, after she had dropped to Sir Claude\r\n",
      "some recall of a previous meeting, he made answer, with a sound of\r\n",
      "consternation and yet an air of relief, that he had denied to their\r\n",
      "companion their having, since the day he came for her, seen each other\r\n",
      "till that moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale could but vaguely pity it. \"Why did you do anything so\r\n",
      "silly?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To protect your reputation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From Maisie?\" Mrs. Beale was much amused. \"My reputation with Maisie is\r\n",
      "too good to suffer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you believed me, you rascal, didn't you?\" Sir Claude asked of the\r\n",
      "child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked at him; she smiled. \"Her reputation did suffer. I discovered\r\n",
      "you had been here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not too chagrined to laugh. \"The way, my dear, you talk of that\r\n",
      "sort of thing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How should she talk,\" Mrs. Beale wanted to know, \"after all this\r\n",
      "wretched time with her mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was not mamma who told me,\" Maisie explained. \"It was only Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix.\" She was hesitating whether to bring out before Sir Claude the\r\n",
      "source of Mrs. Wix's information; but Mrs. Beale, addressing the young\r\n",
      "man, showed the vanity of scruples.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you know that preposterous person came to see me a day or two\r\n",
      "ago?--when I told her I had seen you repeatedly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, for once in a way, was disconcerted. \"The old cat! She never\r\n",
      "told me. Then you thought I had lied?\" he demanded of Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was flurried by the term with which he had qualified her gentle\r\n",
      "friend, but she took the occasion for one to which she must in every\r\n",
      "manner lend herself. \"Oh I didn't mind! But Mrs. Wix did,\" she added\r\n",
      "with an intention benevolent to her governess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her intention was not very effective as regards Mrs. Beale. \"Mrs. Wix is\r\n",
      "too idiotic!\" that lady declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But to you, of all people,\" Sir Claude asked, \"what had she to say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why that, like Mrs. Micawber--whom she must, I think, rather\r\n",
      "resemble--she will never, never, never desert Miss Farange.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'll make that all right!\" Sir Claude cheerfully returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I hope so, my dear man,\" said Mrs. Beale, while Maisie\r\n",
      "wondered just how he would proceed. Before she had time to ask Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale continued: \"That's not all she came to do, if you please. But\r\n",
      "you'll never guess the rest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shall _I_ guess it?\" Maisie quavered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale was again amused. \"Why you're just the person! It must be\r\n",
      "quite the sort of thing you've heard at your awful mother's. Have you\r\n",
      "never seen women there crying to her to 'spare' the men they love?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, wondering, tried to remember; but Sir Claude was freshly\r\n",
      "diverted. \"Oh they don't trouble about Ida! Mrs. Wix cried to you to\r\n",
      "spare ME?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She regularly went down on her knees to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The darling old dear!\" the young man exclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These words were a joy to Maisie--they made up for his previous\r\n",
      "description of Mrs. Wix. \"And WILL you spare him?\" she asked of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her stepmother, seizing her and kissing her again, seemed charmed with\r\n",
      "the tone of her question. \"Not an inch of him! I'll pick him to the\r\n",
      "bone!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean that he'll really come often?\" Maisie pressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale turned lovely eyes to Sir Claude. \"That's not for me to\r\n",
      "say--its for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He said nothing at once, however; with his hands in his pockets\r\n",
      "and vaguely humming a tune--even Maisie could see he was a little\r\n",
      "nervous--he only walked to the window and looked out at the Regent's\r\n",
      "Park. \"Well, he has promised,\" Maisie said. \"But how will papa like it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His being in and out? Ah that's a question that, to be frank with you,\r\n",
      "my dear, hardly matters. In point of fact, however, Beale greatly enjoys\r\n",
      "the idea that Sir Claude too, poor man, has been forced to quarrel with\r\n",
      "your mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude turned round and spoke gravely and kindly. \"Don't be afraid,\r\n",
      "Maisie; you won't lose sight of me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you so much!\" Maisie was radiant. \"But what I meant--don't you\r\n",
      "know?--was what papa would say to ME.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I've been having that out with him,\" said Mrs. Beale. \"He'll behave\r\n",
      "well enough. You see the great difficulty is that, though he changes\r\n",
      "every three days about everything else in the world, he has never\r\n",
      "changed about your mother. It's a caution, the way he hates her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude gave a short laugh. \"It certainly can't beat the way she\r\n",
      "still hates HIM!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Mrs. Beale went on obligingly, \"nothing can take the place of\r\n",
      "that feeling with either of them, and the best way they can think of to\r\n",
      "show it is for each to leave you as long as possible on the hands of the\r\n",
      "other. There's nothing, as you've seen for yourself, that makes either\r\n",
      "so furious. It isn't, asking so little as you do, that you're much of\r\n",
      "an expense or a trouble; it's only that you make each feel so well how\r\n",
      "nasty the other wants to be. Therefore Beale goes on loathing your\r\n",
      "mother too much to have any great fury left for any one else. Besides,\r\n",
      "you know, I've squared him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Lord!\" Sir Claude cried with a louder laugh and turning again to the\r\n",
      "window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_I_ know how!\" Maisie was prompt to proclaim. \"By letting him do what\r\n",
      "he wants on condition that he lets you also do it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're too delicious, my own pet!\"--she was involved in another hug.\r\n",
      "\"How in the world have I got on so long without you? I've not been\r\n",
      "happy, love,\" said Mrs. Beale with her cheek to the child's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Be happy now!\"--she throbbed with shy tenderness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think I shall be. You'll save me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As I'm saving Sir Claude?\" the little girl asked eagerly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, a trifle at a loss, appealed to her visitor, \"Is she\r\n",
      "really?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He showed high amusement at Maisie's question. \"It's dear Mrs. Wix's\r\n",
      "idea. There may be something in it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He makes me his duty--he makes me his life,\" Maisie set forth to her\r\n",
      "stepmother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why that's what _I_ want to do!\"--Mrs. Beale, so anticipated, turned\r\n",
      "pink with astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you can do it together. Then he'll HAVE to come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale by this time had her young friend fairly in her lap and she\r\n",
      "smiled up at Sir Claude. \"Shall we do it together?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His laughter had dropped, and for a moment he turned his handsome\r\n",
      "serious face not to his hostess, but to his stepdaughter. \"Well, it's\r\n",
      "rather more decent than some things. Upon my soul, the way things are\r\n",
      "going, it seems to me the only decency!\" He had the air of arguing it\r\n",
      "out to Maisie, of presenting it, through an impulse of conscience, as a\r\n",
      "connexion in which they could honourably see her participate; though his\r\n",
      "plea of mere \"decency\" might well have appeared to fall below her rosy\r\n",
      "little vision. \"If we're not good for YOU\" he exclaimed, \"I'll be hanged\r\n",
      "if I know who we shall be good for!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale showed the child an intenser light. \"I dare say you WILL save\r\n",
      "us--from one thing and another.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know what she'll save ME from!\" Sir Claude roundly asserted.\r\n",
      "\"There'll be rows of course,\" he went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale quickly took him up. \"Yes, but they'll be nothing--for you\r\n",
      "at least--to the rows your wife makes as it is. I can bear what _I_\r\n",
      "suffer--I can't bear what you go through.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We're doing a good deal for you, you know, young woman,\" Sir Claude\r\n",
      "went on to Maisie with the same gravity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She coloured with a sense of obligation and the eagerness of her desire\r\n",
      "it should be remarked how little was lost on her. \"Oh I know!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you must keep us all right!\" This time he laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How you talk to her!\" cried Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No worse than you!\" he gaily answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Handsome is that handsome does!\" she returned in the same spirit. \"You\r\n",
      "can take off your things,\" she went on, releasing Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child, on her feet, was all emotion. \"Then I'm just to stop--this\r\n",
      "way?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It will do as well as any other. Sir Claude, to-morrow, will have your\r\n",
      "things brought.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll bring them myself. Upon my word I'll see them packed!\" Sir Claude\r\n",
      "promised. \"Come here and unbutton.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had beckoned his young companion to where he sat, and he helped\r\n",
      "to disengage her from her coverings while Mrs. Beale, from a little\r\n",
      "distance, smiled at the hand he displayed. \"There's a stepfather for\r\n",
      "you! I'm bound to say, you know, that he makes up for the want of other\r\n",
      "people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He makes up for the want of a nurse!\" Sir Claude laughed. \"Don't you\r\n",
      "remember I told you so the very first time?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Remember? It was exactly what made me think so well of you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing would induce me,\" the young man said to Maisie, \"to tell you\r\n",
      "what made me think so well of HER.\" Having divested the child he kissed\r\n",
      "her gently and gave her a little pat to make her stand off. The pat was\r\n",
      "accompanied with a vague sigh in which his gravity of a moment before\r\n",
      "came back. \"All the same, if you hadn't had the fatal gift of beauty--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what?\" Maisie asked, wondering why he paused. It was the first\r\n",
      "time she had heard of her beauty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, we shouldn't all be thinking so well of each other!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He isn't speaking of personal loveliness--you've not THAT vulgar\r\n",
      "beauty, my dear, at all,\" Mrs. Beale explained. \"He's just talking of\r\n",
      "plain dull charm of character.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her character's the most extraordinary thing in all the world,\" Sir\r\n",
      "Claude stated to Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know all about that sort of thing!\"--she fairly bridled with the\r\n",
      "knowledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It gave Maisie somehow a sudden sense of responsibility from which she\r\n",
      "sought refuge. \"Well, you've got it too, 'that sort of thing'--you've\r\n",
      "got the fatal gift: you both really have!\" she broke out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Beauty of character? My dear boy, we haven't a pennyworth!\" Sir Claude\r\n",
      "protested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Speak for yourself, sir!\" she leaped lightly from Mrs. Beale. \"I'm good\r\n",
      "and I'm clever. What more do you want? For you, I'll spare your blushes\r\n",
      "and not be personal--I'll simply say that you're as handsome as you can\r\n",
      "stick together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're both very lovely; you can't get out of it!\"--Maisie felt the\r\n",
      "need of carrying her point. \"And it's beautiful to see you side by\r\n",
      "side.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude had taken his hat and stick; he stood looking at her a\r\n",
      "moment. \"You're a comfort in trouble! But I must go home and pack you.\"\r\n",

      "\"And when will you come back?--to-morrow, to-morrow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I can bear it if you can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their companion gazed from one of them to the other, thinking that\r\n",
      "though she had been happy indeed between Sir Claude and Mrs. Wix she\r\n",
      "should evidently be happier still between Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale. But\r\n",
      "it was like being perched on a prancing horse, and she made a movement\r\n",
      "to hold on to something. \"Then, you know, shan't I bid goodbye to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'll make it all right with her,\" said Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie considered. \"And with mamma?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah mamma!\" he sadly laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even for the child this was scarcely ambiguous; but Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "endeavoured to contribute to its clearness. \"Your mother will crow,\r\n",
      "she'll crow--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like the early bird!\" said Sir Claude as she looked about for a\r\n",
      "comparison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll need no consolation,\" Mrs. Beale went on, \"for having made your\r\n",
      "father grandly blaspheme.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie stared. \"Will he grandly blaspheme?\" It was impressive, it might\r\n",
      "have been out of the Bible, and her question produced a fresh play of\r\n",
      "caresses, in which Sir Claude also engaged. She wondered meanwhile who,\r\n",
      "if Mrs. Wix was disposed of, would represent in her life the element of\r\n",
      "geography and anecdote; and she presently surmounted the delicacy she\r\n",
      "felt about asking. \"Won't there be any one to give me lessons?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale was prepared with a reply that struck her as absolutely\r\n",
      "magnificent. \"You shall have such lessons as you've never had in all\r\n",
      "your life. You shall go to courses.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Courses?\" Maisie had never heard of such things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At institutions--on subjects.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie continued to stare. \"Subjects?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale was really splendid. \"All the most important ones. French\r\n",
      "literature--and sacred history. You'll take part in classes--with\r\n",
      "awfully smart children.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm going to look thoroughly into the whole thing, you know.\" And Sir\r\n",
      "Claude, with characteristic kindness, gave her a nod of assurance\r\n",
      "accompanied by a friendly wink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mrs. Beale went much further. \"My dear child, you shall attend\r\n",
      "lectures.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The horizon was suddenly vast and Maisie felt herself the smaller for\r\n",
      "it. \"All alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no; I'll attend them with you,\" said Sir Claude. \"They'll teach me\r\n",
      "a lot I don't know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So they will me,\" Mrs. Beale gravely admitted. \"We'll go with her\r\n",
      "together--it will be charming. It's ages,\" she confessed to Maisie,\r\n",
      "\"since I've had any time for study. That's another sweet way in which\r\n",
      "you'll be a motive to us. Oh won't the good she'll do us be immense?\"\r\n",
      "she broke out uncontrollably to Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He weighed it; then he replied: \"That's certainly our idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "them again. It showed her in short what her father had always meant by\r\n",
      "calling her mother a \"low sneak\" and her mother by calling her father\r\n",
      "one. She wondered if she herself shouldn't be a low sneak in learning to\r\n",
      "be so happy without Mrs. Wix. What would Mrs. Wix do?--where would Mrs.\r\n",

      "these anxieties, on her lips, grew articulate and her stepfather had\r\n",

      "of the sweetness of tranquillity than his present prompt explanations.\r\n",
      "He was at his best in such an office and with the exception of Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "the only person she had met in her life who ever explained. With him,\r\n",
      "however, the act had an authority transcending the wisdom of woman. It\r\n",
      "all came back--the plans that always failed, all the rewards and bribes\r\n",
      "that she was perpetually paying for in advance and perpetually out of\r\n",
      "pocket by afterwards--the whole great stress to be dealt with introduced\r\n",
      "her on each occasion afresh to the question of money. Even she herself\r\n",
      "almost knew how it would have expressed the strength of his empire to\r\n",
      "say that to shuffle away her sense of being duped he had only, from\r\n",
      "under his lovely moustache, to breathe upon it. It was somehow in the\r\n",
      "nature of plans to be expensive and in the nature of the expensive to be\r\n",
      "impossible. To be \"involved\" was of the essence of everybody's affairs,\r\n",

      "with Mrs. Beale's and with Maisie's own at the particular moment, a\r\n",
      "moment of several weeks, that had elapsed since our young lady had been\r\n",
      "re-established at her father's. There wasn't \"two-and-tuppence\" for\r\n",
      "anything or for any one, and that was why there had been no sequel to\r\n",
      "the classes in French literature with all the smart little girls. It\r\n",
      "was devilish awkward, didn't she see? to try, without even the limited\r\n",
      "capital mentioned, to mix her up with a remote array that glittered\r\n",
      "before her after this as the children of the rich. She was to feel\r\n",
      "henceforth as if she were flattening her nose upon the hard window-pane\r\n",
      "of the sweet-shop of knowledge. If the classes, however, that were\r\n",
      "select, and accordingly the only ones, were impossibly dear, the\r\n",
      "lectures at the institutions--at least at some of them--were directly\r\n",
      "addressed to the intelligent poor, and it therefore had to be easier\r\n",
      "still to produce on the spot the reason why she had been taken to none.\r\n",
      "This reason, Sir Claude said, was that she happened to be just going to\r\n",
      "be, though they had nothing to do with that in now directing their steps\r\n",
      "to the banks of the Serpentine. Maisie's own park, in the north, had\r\n",
      "been nearer at hand, but they rolled westward in a hansom because at the\r\n",
      "end of the sweet June days this was the direction taken by every one\r\n",
      "that any one looked at. They cultivated for an hour, on the Row and\r\n",
      "by the Drive, this opportunity for each observer to amuse and for one\r\n",
      "of them indeed, not a little hilariously, to mystify the other, and\r\n",
      "before the hour was over Maisie had elicited, in reply to her sharpest\r\n",
      "challenge, a further account of her friend's long absence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why I've broken my word to you so dreadfully--promising so solemnly and\r\n",
      "then never coming? Well, my dear, that's a question that, not seeing me\r\n",
      "day after day, you must very often have put to Mrs. Beale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" the child replied; \"again and again.\"\r\n",

      "\"That you're as bad as you're beautiful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that what she says?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Those very words.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah the dear old soul!\" Sir Claude was much diverted, and his loud,\r\n",
      "clear laugh was all his explanation. Those were just the words Maisie\r\n",
      "had last heard him use about Mrs. Wix. She clung to his hand, which was\r\n",
      "encased in a pearl-grey glove ornamented with the thick black lines\r\n",
      "that, at her mother's, always used to strike her as connected with the\r\n",
      "way the bestitched fists of the long ladies carried, with the elbows\r\n",
      "well out, their umbrellas upside down. The mere sense of his grasp in\r\n",
      "her own covered the ground of loss just as much as the ground of gain.\r\n",
      "His presence was like an object brought so close to her face that she\r\n",
      "couldn't see round its edges. He himself, however, remained showman of\r\n",
      "the spectacle even after they had passed out of the Park and begun,\r\n",
      "under the charm of the spot and the season, to stroll in Kensington\r\n",
      "Gardens. What they had left behind them was, as he said, only a pretty\r\n",
      "bad circus, and, through prepossessing gates and over a bridge, they\r\n",
      "had come in a quarter of an hour, as he also remarked, a hundred miles\r\n",
      "from London. A great green glade was before them, and high old trees,\r\n",
      "and under the shade of these, in the fresh turf, the crooked course\r\n",
      "of a rural footpath. \"It's the Forest of Arden,\" Sir Claude had just\r\n",
      "delightfully observed, \"and I'm the banished duke, and you're--what was\r\n",
      "the young woman called?--the artless country wench. And there,\" he went\r\n",
      "on, \"is the other girl--what's her name, Rosalind?--and (don't you\r\n",
      "know?) the fellow who was making up to her. Upon my word he IS making\r\n",
      "up to her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His allusion was to a couple who, side by side, at the end of the glade,\r\n",
      "were moving in the same direction as themselves. These distant figures,\r\n",
      "in their slow stroll (which kept them so close together that their\r\n",
      "heads, drooping a little forward, almost touched), presented the back of\r\n",
      "a lady who looked tall, who was evidently a very fine woman, and that\r\n",
      "of a gentleman whose left hand appeared to be passed well into her arm\r\n",
      "while his right, behind him, made jerky motions with the stick that it\r\n",
      "grasped. Maisie's fancy responded for an instant to her friend's idea\r\n",
      "that the sight was idyllic; then, stopping short, she brought out with\r\n",
      "all her clearness: \"Why mercy--if it isn't mamma!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude paused with a stare. \"Mamma? But mamma's at Brussels.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, with her eyes on the lady, wondered. \"At Brussels?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's gone to play a match.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At billiards? You didn't tell me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I didn't!\" Sir Claude ejaculated. \"There's plenty I don't\r\n",
      "tell you. She went on Wednesday.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The couple had added to their distance, but Maisie's eyes more than kept\r\n",
      "pace with them. \"Then she has come back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude watched the lady. \"It's much more likely she never went!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's mamma!\" the child said with decision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had stood still, but Sir Claude had made the most of his\r\n",
      "opportunity, and it happened that just at this moment, at the end of the\r\n",
      "vista, the others halted and, still showing only their backs, seemed to\r\n",
      "stay talking. \"Right you are, my duck!\" he exclaimed at last. \"It's my\r\n",
      "own sweet wife!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had spoken with a laugh, but he had changed colour, and Maisie\r\n",
      "quickly looked away from him. \"Then who is it with her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Blest if I know!\" said Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it Mr. Perriam?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear no--Perriam's smashed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Smashed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Exposed--in the City. But there are quantities of others!\" Sir Claude\r\n",
      "smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie appeared to count them; she studied the gentleman's back. \"Then\r\n",
      "is this Lord Eric?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment her companion made no answer, and when she turned her eyes\r\n",
      "again to him he was looking at her, she thought, rather queerly. \"What\r\n",
      "do you know about Lord Eric?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She tried innocently to be odd in return. \"Oh I know more than you\r\n",
      "think! Is it Lord Eric?\" she repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It maybe. Blest if I care!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their friends had slightly separated and now, as Sir Claude spoke,\r\n",
      "suddenly faced round, showing all the splendour of her ladyship and all\r\n",
      "the mystery of her comrade. Maisie held her breath. \"They're coming!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let them come.\" And Sir Claude, pulling out his cigarettes, began to\r\n",
      "strike a light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall meet them!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. They'll meet US.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie stood her ground. \"They see us. Just look.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude threw away his match. \"Come straight on.\" The others, in the\r\n",
      "return, evidently startled, had half-paused again, keeping well apart.\r\n",
      "\"She's horribly surprised and wants to slope,\" he continued. \"But it's\r\n",
      "too late.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie advanced beside him, making out even across the interval that her\r\n",
      "ladyship was ill at ease. \"Then what will she do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude puffed his cigarette. \"She's quickly thinking.\" He appeared\r\n",
      "to enjoy it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ida had wavered but an instant; her companion clearly gave her moral\r\n",
      "support. Maisie thought he somehow looked brave, and he had no likeness\r\n",
      "whatever to Mr. Perriam. His face, thin and rather sharp, was smooth,\r\n",
      "and it was not till they came nearer that she saw he had a remarkably\r\n",
      "fair little moustache. She could already see that his eyes were of the\r\n",
      "lightest blue. He was far nicer than Mr. Perriam. Mamma looked terrible\r\n",
      "from afar, but even under her guns the child's curiosity flickered and\r\n",
      "she appealed again to Sir Claude. \"Is it--IS it Lord Eric?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude smoked composedly enough. \"I think it's the Count.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a happy solution--it fitted her idea of a count. But what idea,\r\n",
      "as she now came grandly on, did mamma fit?--unless that of an actress,\r\n",
      "in some tremendous situation, sweeping down to the footlights as if she\r\n",
      "would jump them. Maisie felt really so frightened that before she knew\r\n",
      "it she had passed her hand into Sir Claude's arm. Her pressure caused\r\n",
      "him to stop, and at the sight of this the other couple came equally to\r\n",
      "a stand and, beyond the diminished space, remained a moment more in\r\n",
      "talk. This, however, was the matter of an instant; leaving the Count\r\n",
      "apparently to come round more circuitously--an outflanking movement, if\r\n",
      "Maisie had but known--her ladyship resumed the onset. \"What WILL she do\r\n",
      "now?\" her daughter asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude was at present in a position to say: \"Try to pretend it's\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why that I'm up to something.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another minute poor Ida had justified this prediction, erect there\r\n",
      "before them like a figure of justice in full dress. There were parts of\r\n",
      "her face that grew whiter while Maisie looked, and other parts in which\r\n",
      "this change seemed to make other colours reign with more intensity.\r\n",
      "\"What are you doing with my daughter?\" she demanded of her husband; in\r\n",
      "spite of the indignant tone of which Maisie had a greater sense than\r\n",
      "ever in her life before of not being personally noticed. It seemed to\r\n",
      "her Sir Claude also grew pale as an effect of the loud defiance with\r\n",
      "which Ida twice repeated this question. He put her, instead of answering\r\n",
      "it, an enquiry of his own: \"Who the devil have you got hold of NOW?\"\r\n",
      "and at this her ladyship turned tremendously to the child, glaring at\r\n",
      "her as at an equal plotter of sin. Maisie received in petrifaction the\r\n",
      "full force of her mother's huge painted eyes--they were like Japanese\r\n",
      "lanterns swung under festal arches. But life came back to her from a\r\n",
      "tone suddenly and strangely softened. \"Go straight to that gentleman, my\r\n",
      "dear; I've asked him to take you a few minutes. He's charming--go. I've\r\n",
      "something to say to THIS creature.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie felt Sir Claude immediately clutch her. \"No, no--thank you: that\r\n",
      "won't do. She's mine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yours?\" It was confounding to Maisie to hear her speak quite as if she\r\n",
      "had never heard of Sir Claude before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mine. You've given her up. You've not another word to say about her. I\r\n",
      "have her from her father,\" said Sir Claude--a statement that startled\r\n",
      "his companion, who could also measure its lively action on her mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was visibly, however, an influence that made Ida consider; she\r\n",
      "glanced at the gentleman she had left, who, having strolled with his\r\n",
      "hands in his pockets to some distance, stood there with unembarrassed\r\n",
      "vagueness. She directed to him the face that was like an illuminated\r\n",
      "garden, turnstile and all, for the frequentation of which he had his\r\n",
      "season-ticket; then she looked again at Sir Claude. \"I've given her\r\n",
      "up to her father to KEEP--not to get rid of by sending about the town\r\n",
      "either with you or with any one else. If she's not to mind me let HIM\r\n",
      "come and tell me so. I decline to take it from another person, and I\r\n",
      "like your pretending that with your humbug of 'interest' you've a leg to\r\n",
      "stand on. I know your game and have something now to say to you about\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude gave a squeeze of the child's arm. \"Didn't I tell you she'd\r\n",
      "have, Miss Farange?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're uncommonly afraid to hear it,\" Ida went on; \"but if you think\r\n",
      "she'll protect you from it you're mightily mistaken.\" She gave him a\r\n",
      "moment. \"I'll give her the benefit as soon as look at you. Should you\r\n",
      "like her to know, my dear?\" Maisie had a sense of her launching the\r\n",
      "question with effect; yet our young lady was also conscious of hoping\r\n",
      "that Sir Claude would declare that preference. We have already learned\r\n",
      "that she had come to like people's liking her to \"know.\" Before he\r\n",
      "could reply at all, none the less, her mother opened a pair of arms of\r\n",
      "extraordinary elegance, and then she felt the loosening of his grasp.\r\n",
      "\"My own child,\" Ida murmured in a voice--a voice of sudden confused\r\n",
      "tenderness--that it seemed to her she heard for the first time. She\r\n",
      "wavered but an instant, thrilled with the first direct appeal, as\r\n",
      "distinguished from the mere maternal pull, she had ever had from lips\r\n",
      "that, even in the old vociferous years, had always been sharp. The next\r\n",
      "moment she was on her mother's breast, where, amid a wilderness of\r\n",
      "trinkets, she felt as if she had suddenly been thrust, with a smash of\r\n",
      "glass, into a jeweller's shop-front, but only to be as suddenly ejected\r\n",
      "with a push and the brisk injunction: \"Now go to the Captain!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Sir Claude broke into a laugh. \"I told her it was the Count.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ida stared; she rose so superior that she was colossal. \"You're too\r\n",
      "utterly loathsome,\" she then declared. \"Be off!\" she repeated to her\r\n",
      "daughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie started, moved backward and, looking at Sir Claude, \"Only for a\r\n",
      "moment,\" she signed to him in her bewilderment. But he was too angry\r\n",
      "to heed her--too angry with his wife; as she turned away she heard his\r\n",
      "anger break out. \"You damned old b----\"--she couldn't quite hear all.\r\n",
      "It was enough, it was too much: she fled before it, rushing even to a\r\n",

      "As she met the Captain's light blue eyes the greatest marvel occurred;\r\n",
      "she felt a sudden relief at finding them reply with anxiety to the\r\n",
      "horror in her face. \"What in the world has he done?\" He put it all on\r\n",
      "Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has called her a damned old brute.\" She couldn't help bringing that\r\n",
      "out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Captain, at the same elevation as her ladyship, gaped wide; then of\r\n",
      "course, like every one else, he was convulsed. But he instantly caught\r\n",
      "himself up, echoing her bad words. \"A damned old brute--your mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie was already conscious of her second movement. \"I think she tried\r\n",
      "to make him angry.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Captain's stupefaction was fine. \"Angry--SHE? Why she's an angel!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the spot, as he said this, his face won her over; it was so bright\r\n",
      "and kind, and his blue eyes had such a reflexion of some mysterious\r\n",
      "grace that, for him at least, her mother had put forth. Her fund of\r\n",
      "observation enabled her as she gazed up at him to place him: he was a\r\n",
      "candid simple soldier; very grave--she came back to that--but not at\r\n",
      "all terrible. At any rate he struck a note that was new to her and that\r\n",
      "after a moment made her say: \"Do you like her very much?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He smiled down at her, hesitating, looking pleasanter and pleasanter.\r\n",
      "\"Let me tell you about your mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put out a big military hand which she immediately took, and they\r\n",
      "turned off together to where a couple of chairs had been placed under\r\n",
      "one of the trees. \"She told me to come to you,\" Maisie explained as they\r\n",
      "went; and presently she was close to him in a chair, with the prettiest\r\n",
      "of pictures--the sheen of the lake through other trees--before them, and\r\n",
      "the sound of birds, the plash of boats, the play of children in the air.\r\n",
      "The Captain, inclining his military person, sat sideways to be closer\r\n",
      "and kinder, and as her hand was on the arm of her seat he put his own\r\n",
      "down on it again to emphasise something he had to say that would be good\r\n",
      "for her to hear. He had already told her how her mother, from the moment\r\n",
      "of seeing her so unexpectedly with a person who was--well, not at all\r\n",
      "the right person, had promptly asked him to take charge of her while she\r\n",
      "herself tackled, as she said, the real culprit. He gave the child the\r\n",
      "sense of doing for the time what he liked with her; ten minutes before\r\n",
      "she had never seen him, but she could now sit there touching him,\r\n",
      "touched and impressed by him and thinking it nice when a gentleman\r\n",
      "was thin and brown--brown with a kind of clear depth that made his\r\n",
      "straw-coloured moustache almost white and his eyes resemble little pale\r\n",
      "flowers. The most extraordinary thing was the way she didn't appear just\r\n",
      "then to mind Sir Claude's being tackled. The Captain wasn't a bit like\r\n",
      "him, for it was an odd part of the pleasantness of mamma's friend that\r\n",
      "it resided in a manner in this friend's having a face so informally put\r\n",
      "together that the only kindness could be to call it funny. An odder part\r\n",
      "still was that it finally made our young lady, to classify him further,\r\n",
      "say to herself that, of all people in the world, he reminded her most\r\n",
      "insidiously of Mrs. Wix. He had neither straighteners nor a diadem, nor,\r\n",
      "at least in the same place as the other, a button; he was sun-burnt and\r\n",
      "deep-voiced and smelt of cigars, yet he marvellously had more in common\r\n",
      "with her old governess than with her young stepfather. What he had\r\n",
      "to say to her that was good for her to hear was that her poor mother\r\n",
      "(didn't she know?) was the best friend he had ever had in all his life.\r\n",
      "And he added: \"She has told me ever so much about you. I'm awfully glad\r\n",
      "to know you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had never, she thought, been so addressed as a young lady, not even\r\n",
      "by Sir Claude the day, so long ago, that she found him with Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "It struck her as the way that at balls, by delightful partners, young\r\n",
      "ladies must be spoken to in the intervals of dances; and she tried to\r\n",
      "think of something that would meet it at the same high point. But this\r\n",
      "effort flurried her, and all she could produce was: \"At first, you know,\r\n",
      "I thought you were Lord Eric.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Captain looked vague. \"Lord Eric?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And then Sir Claude thought you were the Count.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this he laughed out. \"Why he's only five foot high and as red as\r\n",
      "a lobster!\" Maisie laughed, with a certain elegance, in return--the\r\n",
      "young lady at the ball certainly would--and was on the point, as\r\n",
      "conscientiously, of pursuing the subject with an agreeable question. But\r\n",
      "before she could speak her companion challenged her. \"Who in the world's\r\n",
      "Lord Eric?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you know him?\" She judged her young lady would say that with\r\n",
      "light surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean a fat man with his mouth always open?\" She had to\r\n",
      "confess that their acquaintance was so limited that she could only\r\n",
      "describe the bearer of the name as a friend of mamma's; but a light\r\n",
      "suddenly came to the Captain, who quickly spoke as knowing her man.\r\n",
      "\"What-do-you-call-him's brother, the fellow that owned Bobolink?\" Then,\r\n",
      "with all his kindness, he contradicted her flat. \"Oh dear no; your\r\n",
      "mother never knew HIM.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But Mrs. Wix said so,\" the child risked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Wix?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My old governess.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This again seemed amusing to the Captain. \"She mixed him up, your old\r\n",
      "governess. He's an awful beast. Your mother never looked at him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was as positive as he was friendly, but he dropped for a minute after\r\n",
      "this into a silence that gave Maisie, confused but ingenious, a chance\r\n",
      "to redeem the mistake of pretending to know too much by the humility of\r\n",
      "inviting further correction. \"And doesn't she know the Count?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I dare say! But he's another ass.\" After which abruptly, with a\r\n",
      "different look, he put down again on the back of her own the hand he had\r\n",
      "momentarily removed. Maisie even thought he coloured a little. \"I want\r\n",
      "tremendously to speak to you. You must never believe any harm of your\r\n",
      "mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I assure you I DON'T!\" cried the child, blushing, herself, up to her\r\n",
      "eyes in a sudden surge of deprecation of such a thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Captain, bending his head, raised her hand to his lips with a\r\n",
      "benevolence that made her wish her glove had been nicer. \"Of course you\r\n",
      "don't when you know how fond she is of YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's fond of me?\" Maisie panted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tremendously. But she thinks you don't like her. You MUST like her. She\r\n",
      "has had too much to put up with.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--I know!\" She rejoiced that she had never denied it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course I've no right to speak of her except as a particular friend,\"\r\n",
      "the Captain went on. \"But she's a splendid woman. She has never had any\r\n",
      "sort of justice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hasn't she?\"--his companion, to hear the words, felt a thrill\r\n",
      "altogether new.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps I oughtn't to say it to you, but she has had everything to\r\n",
      "suffer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--you can SAY it to me!\" Maisie hastened to profess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Captain was glad. \"Well, you needn't tell. It's all for YOU--do you\r\n",
      "see?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Serious and smiling she only wanted to take it from him. \"It's between\r\n",
      "you and me! Oh there are lots of things I've never told!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, keep this with the rest. I assure you she has had the most\r\n",
      "infernal time, no matter what any one says to the contrary. She's the\r\n",
      "cleverest woman I ever saw in all my life. She's too charming.\" She had\r\n",
      "been touched already by his tone, and now she leaned back in her chair\r\n",
      "and felt something tremble within her. \"She's tremendous fun--she can\r\n",
      "do all sorts of things better than I've ever seen any one. She has the\r\n",
      "pluck of fifty--and I know; I assure you I do. She has the nerve for a\r\n",
      "tiger-shoot--by Jove I'd TAKE her! And she is awfully open and generous,\r\n",
      "don't you know? there are women that are such horrid sneaks. She'll\r\n",
      "go through anything for any one she likes.\" He appeared to watch for\r\n",
      "a moment the effect on his companion of this emphasis; then he gave a\r\n",
      "small sigh that mourned the limits of the speakable. But it was almost\r\n",
      "with the note of a fresh challenge that he wound up: \"Look here, she's\r\n",
      "TRUE!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had so little desire to assert the contrary that she found\r\n",
      "herself, in the intensity of her response, throbbing with a joy still\r\n",
      "less utterable than the essence of the Captain's admiration. She was\r\n",
      "fairly hushed with the sense that he spoke of her mother as she had\r\n",
      "never heard any one speak. It came over her as she sat silent that,\r\n",
      "after all, this admiration and this respect were quite new words, which\r\n",
      "took a distinction from the fact that nothing in the least resembling\r\n",
      "them in quality had on any occasion dropped from the lips of her father,\r\n",
      "of Mrs. Beale, of Sir Claude or even of Mrs. Wix. What it appeared to\r\n",
      "her to come to was that on the subject of her ladyship it was the first\r\n",
      "real kindness she had heard, so that at the touch of it something\r\n",
      "strange and deep and pitying surged up within her--a revelation that,\r\n",
      "practically and so far as she knew, her mother, apart from this,\r\n",
      "had only been disliked. Mrs. Wix's original account of Sir Claude's\r\n",
      "affection seemed as empty now as the chorus in a children's game, and\r\n",
      "the husband and wife, but a little way off at that moment, were face to\r\n",
      "face in hatred and with the dreadful name he had called her still in the\r\n",
      "air. What was it the Captain on the other hand had called her? Maisie\r\n",
      "wanted to hear that again. The tears filled her eyes and rolled down\r\n",
      "her cheeks, which burned under them with the rush of a consciousness\r\n",
      "that for her too, five minutes before, the vivid towering beauty whose\r\n",
      "assault she awaited had been, a moment long, an object of pure dread.\r\n",
      "She became on the spot indifferent to her usual fear of showing what\r\n",
      "in children was notoriously most offensive--presented to her companion,\r\n",
      "soundlessly but hideously, her wet distorted face. She cried, with a\r\n",
      "pang, straight AT him, cried as she had never cried at any one in all\r\n",
      "her life. \"Oh do you love her?\" she brought out with a gulp that was\r\n",
      "the effect of her trying not to make a noise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was doubtless another consequence of the thick mist through which she\r\n",
      "saw him that in reply to her question the Captain gave her such a queer\r\n",
      "blurred look. He stammered, yet in his voice there was also the ring of\r\n",
      "a great awkward insistence. \"Of course I'm tremendously fond of her--I\r\n",
      "like her better than any woman I ever saw. I don't mind in the least\r\n",
      "telling you that,\" he went on, \"and I should think myself a great beast\r\n",
      "if I did.\" Then to show that his position was superlatively clear he\r\n",
      "made her, with a kindness that even Sir Claude had never surpassed,\r\n",
      "tremble again as she had trembled at his first outbreak. He called her\r\n",
      "by her name, and her name drove it home. \"My dear Maisie, your mother's\r\n",
      "an angel!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was an almost unbelievable balm--it soothed so her impression of\r\n",
      "danger and pain. She sank back in her chair, she covered her face\r\n",
      "with her hands. \"Oh mother, mother, mother!\" she sobbed. She had an\r\n",
      "impression that the Captain, beside her, if more and more friendly, was\r\n",
      "by no means unembarrassed; in a minute, however, when her eyes were\r\n",
      "clearer, he was erect in front of her, very red and nervously looking\r\n",
      "about him and whacking his leg with his stick. \"Say you love her, Mr.\r\n",
      "Captain; say it, say it!\" she implored.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Captain's blue eyes fixed themselves very hard. \"Of course I love\r\n",
      "her, damn it, you know!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this she also jumped up; she had fished out somehow her\r\n",
      "pocket-handkerchief. \"So do I then. I do, I do, I do!\" she passionately\r\n",
      "asseverated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then will you come back to her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, staring, stopped the tight little plug of her handkerchief on\r\n",
      "the way to her eyes. \"She won't have me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes she will. She wants you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Back at the house--with Sir Claude?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again he hung fire. \"No, not with him. In another place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They stood looking at each other with an intensity unusual as between a\r\n",
      "Captain and a little girl. \"She won't have me in any place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes she will if _I_ ask her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie's intensity continued. \"Shall you be there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Captain's, on the whole, did the same. \"Oh yes--some day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you don't mean now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He broke into a quick smile. \"Will you come now?--go with us for an\r\n",
      "hour?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie considered. \"She wouldn't have me even now.\" She could see that\r\n",
      "he had his idea, but that her tone impressed him. That disappointed her\r\n",
      "a little, though in an instant he rang out again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She will if I ask her,\" he repeated. \"I'll ask her this minute.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, turning at this, looked away to where her mother and her\r\n",
      "stepfather had stopped. At first, among the trees, nobody was visible;\r\n",
      "but the next moment she exclaimed with expression: \"It's over--here he\r\n",
      "comes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Captain watched the approach of her ladyship's husband, who lounged\r\n",
      "composedly over the grass, making to Maisie with his closed fingers a\r\n",
      "little movement in the air. \"I've no desire to avoid him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you mustn't see him,\" said Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh he's in no hurry himself!\" Sir Claude had stopped to light another\r\n",
      "cigarette.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was vague as to the way it was proper he should feel; but she had a\r\n",
      "sense that the Captain's remark was rather a free reflexion on it. \"Oh\r\n",
      "he doesn't care!\" she replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doesn't care for what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doesn't care who you are. He told me so. Go and ask mamma,\" she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you can come with us? Very good. You really want me not to wait for\r\n",
      "him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"PLEASE don't.\" But Sir Claude was not yet near, and the Captain had\r\n",
      "with his left hand taken hold of her right, which he familiarly,\r\n",
      "sociably swung a little. \"Only first,\" she continued, \"tell me this. Are\r\n",
      "you going to LIVE with mamma?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The immemorial note of mirth broke out at her seriousness. \"One of these\r\n",
      "days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She wondered, wholly unperturbed by his laughter. \"Then where will Sir\r\n",
      "Claude be?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll have left her of course.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Does he really intend to do that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've every opportunity to ask him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie shook her head with decision. \"He won't do it. Not first.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her \"first\" made the Captain laugh out again. \"Oh he'll be sure to be\r\n",
      "nasty! But I've said too much to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you know, I'll never tell,\" said Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, it's all for yourself. Good-bye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye.\" Maisie kept his hand long enough to add: \"I like you too.\"\r\n",
      "And then supremely: \"You DO love her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child--!\" The Captain wanted words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then don't do it only for just a little.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A little?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like all the others.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All the others?\"--he stood staring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She pulled away her hand. \"Do it always!\" She bounded to meet Sir\r\n",
      "Claude, and as she left the Captain she heard him ring out with apparent\r\n",
      "gaiety:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'm in for it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she joined Sir Claude she noted her mother in the distance move\r\n",
      "slowly off, and, glancing again at the Captain, saw him, swinging his\r\n",
      "stick, retreat in the same direction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had never seen Sir Claude look as he looked just then; flushed yet\r\n",
      "not excited--settled rather in an immoveable disgust and at once very\r\n",
      "sick and very hard. His conversation with her mother had clearly drawn\r\n",
      "blood, and the child's old horror came back to her, begetting the\r\n",
      "instant moral contraction of the days when her parents had looked to\r\n",
      "her to feed their love of battle. Her greatest fear for the moment,\r\n",
      "however, was that her friend would see she had been crying. The next\r\n",
      "she became aware that he had glanced at her, and it presently occurred\r\n",
      "to her that he didn't even wish to be looked at. At this she quickly\r\n",
      "removed her gaze, while he said rather curtly: \"Well, who in the world\r\n",
      "IS the fellow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She felt herself flooded with prudence. \"Oh _I_ haven't found out!\" This\r\n",

      "by halves.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Then what I ask you, please, is HOW?\" She kept silence--so long that\r\n",
      "he presently went on: \"I say, you know--don't you hear me?\" At this she\r\n",
      "produced: \"Well, I'm afraid I didn't attend to him very much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, smoking rather hard, made no immediate rejoinder; but\r\n",
      "finally he exclaimed: \"Then my dear--with such a chance--you were the\r\n",
      "perfection of a dunce!\" He was so irritated--or she took him to be--that\r\n",
      "for the rest of the time they were in the Gardens he spoke no other\r\n",
      "word; and she meanwhile subtly abstained from any attempt to pacify him.\r\n",
      "That would only lead to more questions. At the gate of the Gardens he\r\n",
      "hailed a four-wheeled cab and, in silence, without meeting her eyes, put\r\n",
      "her into it, only saying \"Give him THAT\" as he tossed half a crown upon\r\n",
      "the seat. Even when from outside he had closed the door and told the man\r\n",
      "where to go he never took her departing look. Nothing of this kind had\r\n",
      "ever yet happened to them, but it had no power to make her love him\r\n",
      "less; so she could not only bear it, she felt as she drove away--she\r\n",
      "could rejoice in it. It brought again the sweet sense of success that,\r\n",
      "ages before, she had had at a crisis when, on the stairs, returning from\r\n",
      "her father's, she had met a fierce question of her mother's with an\r\n",
      "imbecility as deep and had in consequence been dashed by Mrs. Farange\r\n",

      "If for reasons of her own she could bear the sense of Sir Claude's\r\n",
      "displeasure her young endurance might have been put to a serious test.\r\n",
      "The days went by without his knocking at her father's door, and the\r\n",
      "time would have turned sadly to waste if something hadn't conspicuously\r\n",
      "happened to give it a new difference. What took place was a marked\r\n",
      "change in the attitude of Mrs. Beale--a change that somehow, even\r\n",
      "in his absence, seemed to bring Sir Claude again into the house. It\r\n",
      "began practically with a conversation that occurred between them the\r\n",
      "day Maisie, came home alone in the cab. Mrs. Beale had by that time\r\n",
      "returned, and she was more successful than their friend in extracting\r\n",
      "from our young lady an account of the extraordinary passage with the\r\n",
      "Captain. She came back to it repeatedly, and on the very next day it\r\n",
      "grew distinct to the child that she was already in full possession of\r\n",
      "what at the same moment had been enacted between her ladyship and Sir\r\n",
      "Claude. This was the real origin of her final perception that though he\r\n",
      "didn't come to the house her stepmother had some rare secret for not\r\n",
      "being quite without him. This led to some rare passages with Mrs. Beale,\r\n",
      "the promptest of which had been--not on Maisie's part--a wonderful\r\n",
      "outbreak of tears. Mrs. Beale was not, as she herself said, a crying\r\n",
      "creature: she hadn't cried, to Maisie's knowledge, since the lowly\r\n",
      "governess days, the grey dawn of their connexion. But she wept now with\r\n",
      "passion, professing loudly that it did her good and saying remarkable\r\n",
      "things to her charge, for whom the occasion was an equal benefit, an\r\n",
      "addition to all the fine precautionary wisdom stored away. It somehow\r\n",
      "hadn't violated that wisdom, Maisie felt, for her to have told Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale what she had not told Sir Claude, inasmuch as the greatest strain,\r\n",
      "to her sense, was between Sir Claude and Sir Claude's wife, and his wife\r\n",
      "was just what Mrs. Beale was unfortunately not. He sent his stepdaughter\r\n",
      "three days after the incident in Kensington Gardens a message as frank\r\n",
      "as it was tender, and that was how Mrs. Beale had had to bring out in\r\n",
      "a manner that seemed half an appeal, half a defiance: \"Well yes, hang\r\n",
      "it--I DO see him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How and when and where, however, were just what Maisie was not to\r\n",
      "know--an exclusion moreover that she never questioned in the light of\r\n",
      "a participation large enough to make him, while she shared the ample\r\n",
      "void of Mrs. Beale's rather blank independence, shine in her yearning\r\n",
      "eye like the single, the sovereign window-square of a great dim\r\n",
      "disproportioned room. As far as her father was concerned such hours\r\n",
      "had no interruption; and then it was clear between them that each\r\n",
      "was thinking of the absent and thinking the other thought, so that he\r\n",
      "was an object of conscious reference in everything they said or did.\r\n",
      "The wretched truth, Mrs. Beale had to confess, was that she had hoped\r\n",
      "against hope and that in the Regent's Park it was impossible Sir Claude\r\n",
      "should really be in and out. Hadn't they at last to look the fact in the\r\n",
      "face?--it was too disgustingly evident that no one after all had been\r\n",
      "squared. Well, if no one had been squared it was because every one had\r\n",
      "been vile. No one and every one were of course Beale and Ida, the extent\r\n",
      "of whose power to be nasty was a thing that, to a little girl, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale simply couldn't give chapter and verse for. Therefore it was that\r\n",
      "to keep going at all, as she said, that lady had to make, as she also\r\n",
      "said, another arrangement--the arrangement in which Maisie was included\r\n",
      "only to the point of knowing it existed and wondering wistfully what it\r\n",
      "was. Conspicuously at any rate it had a side that was responsible for\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale's sudden emotion and sudden confidence--a demonstration\r\n",
      "this, however, of which the tearfulness was far from deterrent to our\r\n",
      "heroine's thought of how happy she should be if she could only make an\r\n",
      "arrangement for herself. Mrs. Beale's own operated, it appeared, with\r\n",
      "regularity and frequency; for it was almost every day or two that she\r\n",
      "was able to bring Maisie a message and to take one back. It had been\r\n",
      "over the vision of what, as she called it, he did for her that she\r\n",
      "broke down; and this vision was kept in a manner before Maisie by a\r\n",
      "subsequent increase not only of the gaiety, but literally--it seemed not\r\n",
      "presumptuous to perceive--of the actual virtue of her friend. The friend\r\n",
      "was herself the first to proclaim it: he had pulled her up immensely--he\r\n",
      "had quite pulled her round. She had charming tormenting words about him:\r\n",
      "he was her good fairy, her hidden spring--above all he was just her\r\n",
      "\"higher\" conscience. That was what had particularly come out with her\r\n",
      "startling tears: he had made her, dear man, think ever so much better of\r\n",
      "herself. It had been thus rather surprisingly revealed that she had been\r\n",
      "in a way to think ill, and Maisie was glad to hear of the corrective at\r\n",
      "the same time that she heard of the ailment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She presently found herself supposing, and in spite of her envy even\r\n",
      "hoping, that whenever Mrs. Beale was out of the house Sir Claude had\r\n",
      "in some manner the satisfaction of it. This was now of more frequent\r\n",
      "occurrence than ever before--so much so that she would have thought of\r\n",
      "her stepmother as almost extravagantly absent had it not been that, in\r\n",
      "the first place, her father was a superior specimen of that habit: it\r\n",
      "was the frequent remark of his present wife, as it had been, before the\r\n",
      "tribunals of their country, a prominent plea of her predecessor, that\r\n",
      "he scarce came home even to sleep. In the second place Mrs. Beale, when\r\n",
      "she WAS on the spot, had now a beautiful air of longing to make up for\r\n",
      "everything. The only shadow in such bright intervals was that, as Maisie\r\n",
      "put it to herself, she could get nothing by questions. It was in the\r\n",
      "nature of things to be none of a small child's business, even when a\r\n",
      "small child had from the first been deluded into a fear that she might\r\n",
      "be only too much initiated. Things then were in Maisie's experience so\r\n",
      "true to their nature that questions were almost always improper; but\r\n",
      "she learned on the other hand soon to recognise how at last, sometimes,\r\n",
      "patient little silences and intelligent little looks could be rewarded\r\n",
      "by delightful little glimpses. There had been years at Beale Farange's\r\n",
      "when the monosyllable \"he\" meant always, meant almost violently, the\r\n",
      "master; but all that was changed at a period at which Sir Claude's\r\n",
      "merits were of themselves so much in the air that it scarce took even\r\n",
      "two letters to name him. \"He keeps me up splendidly--he does, my own\r\n",
      "precious,\" Mrs. Beale would observe to her comrade; or else she would\r\n",
      "say that the situation at the other establishment had reached a point\r\n",
      "that could scarcely be believed--the point, monstrous as it sounded,\r\n",
      "of his not having laid eyes upon her for twelve days. \"She\" of course\r\n",
      "at Beale Farange's had never meant any one but Ida, and there was the\r\n",
      "difference in this case that it now meant Ida with renewed intensity.\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale--it was striking--was in a position to animadvert more and\r\n",
      "more upon her dreadfulness, the moral of all which appeared to be how\r\n",
      "abominably yet blessedly little she had to do with her husband. This\r\n",
      "flow of information came home to our two friends because, truly, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale had not much more to do with her own; but that was one of the\r\n",
      "reflexions that Maisie could make without allowing it to break the\r\n",
      "spell of her present sympathy. How could such a spell be anything but\r\n",
      "deep when Sir Claude's influence, operating from afar, at last really\r\n",
      "determined the resumption of his stepdaughter's studies? Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "again took fire about them and was quite vivid for Maisie as to their\r\n",
      "being the great matter to which the dear absent one kept her up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the second source--I have just alluded to the first--of the\r\n",
      "child's consciousness of something that, very hopefully, she described\r\n",
      "to herself as a new phase; and it also presented in the brightest light\r\n",
      "the fresh enthusiasm with which Mrs. Beale always reappeared and which\r\n",
      "really gave Maisie a happier sense than she had yet had of being very\r\n",
      "dear at least to two persons. That she had small remembrance at present\r\n",
      "of a third illustrates, I am afraid, a temporary oblivion of Mrs. Wix,\r\n",
      "an accident to be explained only by a state of unnatural excitement. For\r\n",
      "what was the form taken by Mrs. Beale's enthusiasm and acquiring relief\r\n",
      "in the domestic conditions still left to her but the delightful form of\r\n",
      "\"reading\" with her little charge on lines directly prescribed and in\r\n",
      "works profusely supplied by Sir Claude? He had got hold of an awfully\r\n",
      "good list--\"mostly essays, don't you know?\" Mrs. Beale had said; a word\r\n",
      "always august to Maisie, but henceforth to be softened by hazy, in fact\r\n",
      "by quite languorous edges. There was at any rate a week in which no less\r\n",
      "than nine volumes arrived, and the impression was to be gathered from\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale that the obscure intercourse she enjoyed with Sir Claude not\r\n",
      "only involved an account and a criticism of studies, but was organised\r\n",
      "almost for the very purpose of report and consultation. It was for\r\n",
      "Maisie's education in short that, as she often repeated, she closed her\r\n",
      "door--closed it to the gentlemen who used to flock there in such numbers\r\n",
      "and whom her husband's practical desertion of her would have made it a\r\n",
      "course of the highest indelicacy to receive. Maisie was familiar from of\r\n",
      "old with the principle at least of the care that a woman, as Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "phrased it, attractive and exposed must take of her \"character,\" and was\r\n",
      "duly impressed with the rigour of her stepmother's scruples. There was\r\n",
      "literally no one of the other sex whom she seemed to feel at liberty to\r\n",
      "see at home, and when the child risked an enquiry about the ladies who,\r\n",
      "one by one, during her own previous period, had been made quite loudly\r\n",
      "welcome, Mrs. Beale hastened to inform her that, one by one, they had,\r\n",
      "the fiends, been found out, after all, to be awful. If she wished to\r\n",
      "know more about them she was recommended to approach her father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had, however, at the very moment of this injunction much livelier\r\n",
      "curiosities, for the dream of lectures at an institution had at last\r\n",
      "become a reality, thanks to Sir Claude's now unbounded energy in\r\n",
      "discovering what could be done. It stood out in this connexion that when\r\n",
      "you came to look into things in a spirit of earnestness an immense deal\r\n",
      "could be done for very little more than your fare in the Underground.\r\n",
      "The institution--there was a splendid one in a part of the town but\r\n",
      "little known to the child--became, in the glow of such a spirit, a\r\n",
      "thrilling place, and the walk to it from the station through Glower\r\n",
      "Street (a pronunciation for which Mrs. Beale once laughed at her little\r\n",
      "friend) a pathway literally strewn with \"subjects.\" Maisie imagined\r\n",
      "herself to pluck them as she went, though they thickened in the great\r\n",
      "grey rooms where the fountain of knowledge, in the form usually of a\r\n",
      "high voice that she took at first to be angry, plashed in the stillness\r\n",
      "of rows of faces thrust out like empty jugs. \"It MUST do us good--it's\r\n",
      "all so hideous,\" Mrs. Beale had immediately declared; manifesting a\r\n",
      "purity of resolution that made these occasions quite the most harmonious\r\n",
      "of all the many on which the pair had pulled together. Maisie certainly\r\n",
      "had never, in such an association, felt so uplifted, and never above\r\n",
      "all been so carried off her feet, as at the moments of Mrs. Beale's\r\n",
      "breathlessly re-entering the house and fairly shrieking upstairs to\r\n",
      "know if they should still be in time for a lecture. Her stepdaughter,\r\n",
      "all ready from the earliest hours, almost leaped over the banister to\r\n",
      "respond, and they dashed out together in quest of learning as hard as\r\n",
      "they often dashed back to release Mrs. Beale for other preoccupations.\r\n",
      "There had been in short no bustle like these particular spasms, once\r\n",
      "they had broken out, since that last brief flurry when Mrs. Wix, blowing\r\n",
      "as if she were grooming her, \"made up\" for everything previously lost at\r\n",
      "her father's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These weeks as well were too few, but they were flooded with a new\r\n",
      "emotion, part of which indeed came from the possibility that, through\r\n",
      "the long telescope of Glower Street, or perhaps between the pillars of\r\n",
      "the institution--which impressive objects were what Maisie thought most\r\n",
      "made it one--they should some day spy Sir Claude. That was what Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale, under pressure, had said--doubtless a little impatiently: \"Oh\r\n",
      "yes, oh yes, some day!\" His joining them was clearly far less of a\r\n",
      "matter of course than was to have been gathered from his original\r\n",
      "profession of desire to improve in their company his own mind; and\r\n",
      "this sharpened our young lady's guess that since that occasion either\r\n",
      "something destructive had happened or something desirable hadn't. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale had thrown but a partial light in telling her how it had turned\r\n",
      "out that nobody had been squared. Maisie wished at any rate that\r\n",
      "somebody WOULD be squared. However, though in every approach to the\r\n",
      "temple of knowledge she watched in vain for Sir Claude, there was\r\n",
      "no doubt about the action of his loved image as an incentive and a\r\n",
      "recompense. When the institution was most on pillars--or, as Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "put it, on stilts--when the subject was deepest and the lecture longest\r\n",
      "and the listeners ugliest, then it was they both felt their patron in\r\n",
      "the background would be most pleased with them. One day, abruptly, with\r\n",
      "a glance at this background, Mrs. Beale said to her companion: \"We'll\r\n",
      "go to-night to the thingumbob at Earl's Court\"; an announcement putting\r\n",
      "forth its full lustre when she had made known that she referred to\r\n",
      "the great Exhibition just opened in that quarter, a collection of\r\n",
      "extraordinary foreign things in tremendous gardens, with illuminations,\r\n",
      "bands, elephants, switchbacks and side-shows, as well as crowds of\r\n",
      "people among whom they might possibly see some one they knew. Maisie\r\n",
      "flew in the same bound at the neck of her friend and at the name of Sir\r\n",
      "Claude, on which Mrs. Beale confessed that--well, yes, there was just a\r\n",
      "chance that he would be able to meet them. He never of course, in his\r\n",
      "terrible position, knew what might happen from hour to hour; but he\r\n",
      "hoped to be free and he had given Mrs. Beale the tip. \"Bring her there\r\n",
      "on the quiet and I'll try to turn up\"--this was clear enough on what\r\n",
      "so many weeks of privation had made of his desire to see the child: it\r\n",
      "even appeared to represent on his part a yearning as constant as her\r\n",
      "own. That in turn was just puzzling enough to make Maisie express a\r\n",
      "bewilderment. She couldn't see, if they were so intensely of the same\r\n",
      "mind, why the theory on which she had come back to Mrs. Beale, the\r\n",
      "general reunion, the delightful trio, should have broken down so in\r\n",
      "fact. Mrs. Beale furthermore only gave her more to think about in saying\r\n",
      "that their disappointment was the result of his having got into his head\r\n",
      "a kind of idea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What kind of idea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh goodness knows!\" She spoke with an approach to asperity. \"He's so\r\n",
      "awfully delicate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Delicate?\"--that was ambiguous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About what he does, don't you know?\" said Mrs. Beale. She fumbled.\r\n",
      "\"Well, about what WE do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie wondered. \"You and me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Me and HIM, silly!\" cried Mrs. Beale with, this time, a real giggle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you don't do any harm--YOU don't,\" said Maisie, wondering afresh\r\n",
      "and intending her emphasis as a decorous allusion to her parents.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course we don't, you angel--that's just the ground _I_ take!\" her\r\n",
      "companion exultantly responded. \"He says he doesn't want you mixed up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mixed up with what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's exactly what _I_ want to know: mixed up with what, and how you\r\n",
      "are any more mixed--?\" Mrs. Beale paused without ending her question.\r\n",
      "She ended after an instant in a different way. \"All you can say is that\r\n",
      "it's his fancy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tone of this, in spite of its expressing a resignation, the fruit of\r\n",
      "weariness, that dismissed the subject, conveyed so vividly how much such\r\n",
      "a fancy was not Mrs. Beale's own that our young lady was led by the mere\r\n",
      "fact of contact to arrive at a dim apprehension of the unuttered and the\r\n",
      "unknown. The relation between her step-parents had then a mysterious\r\n",
      "residuum; this was the first time she really had reflected that except\r\n",
      "as regards herself it was not a relationship. To each other it was only\r\n",
      "what they might have happened to make it, and she gathered that this,\r\n",
      "in the event, had been something that led Sir Claude to keep away from\r\n",
      "her. Didn't he fear she would be compromised? The perception of such a\r\n",
      "scruple endeared him the more, and it flashed over her that she might\r\n",
      "simplify everything by showing him how little she made of such a danger.\r\n",
      "Hadn't she lived with her eyes on it from her third year? It was the\r\n",
      "condition most frequently discussed at the Faranges', where the word was\r\n",
      "always in the air and where at the age of five, amid rounds of applause,\r\n",
      "she could gabble it off. She knew as well in short that a person could\r\n",
      "be compromised as that a person could be slapped with a hair-brush or\r\n",
      "left alone in the dark, and it was equally familiar to her that each of\r\n",
      "these ordeals was in general held to have too little effect. But the\r\n",
      "first thing was to make absolutely sure of Mrs. Beale. This was done by\r\n",
      "saying to her thoughtfully: \"Well, if you don't mind--and you really\r\n",
      "don't, do you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, with a dawn of amusement, considered. \"Mixing you up? Not a\r\n",
      "bit. For what does it mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Whatever it means I don't in the least mind BEING mixed. Therefore if\r\n",
      "you don't and I don't,\" Maisie concluded, \"don't you think that when I\r\n",
      "see him this evening I had better just tell him we don't and ask him why\r\n",
      "in the world HE should?\"\r\n",

      "The child, however, was not destined to enjoy much of Sir Claude at the\r\n",
      "\"thingumbob,\" which took for them a very different turn indeed. On the\r\n",
      "spot Mrs. Beale, with hilarity, had urged her to the course proposed;\r\n",
      "but later, at the Exhibition, she withdrew this allowance, mentioning as\r\n",
      "a result of second thoughts that when a man was so sensitive anything at\r\n",
      "all frisky usually made him worse. It would have been hard indeed for\r\n",
      "Sir Claude to be \"worse,\" Maisie felt, as, in the gardens and the crowd,\r\n",
      "when the first dazzle had dropped, she looked for him in vain up and\r\n",
      "down. They had all their time, the couple, for frugal wistful wandering:\r\n",
      "they had partaken together at home of the light vague meal--Maisie's\r\n",
      "name for it was a \"jam-supper\"--to which they were reduced when Mr.\r\n",
      "Farange sought his pleasure abroad. It was abroad now entirely that Mr.\r\n",
      "Farange pursued this ideal, and it was the actual impression of his\r\n",
      "daughter, derived from his wife, that he had three days before joined a\r\n",
      "friend's yacht at Cowes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The place was full of side-shows, to which Mrs. Beale could introduce\r\n",
      "the little girl only, alas, by revealing to her so attractive, so\r\n",
      "enthralling a name: the side-shows, each time, were sixpence apiece,\r\n",
      "and the fond allegiance enjoyed by the elder of our pair had been\r\n",
      "established from the earliest time in spite of a paucity of sixpences.\r\n",
      "Small coin dropped from her as half-heartedly as answers from bad\r\n",
      "children to lessons that had not been looked at. Maisie passed more\r\n",
      "slowly the great painted posters, pressing with a linked arm closer\r\n",
      "to her friend's pocket, where she hoped for the audible chink of a\r\n",
      "shilling. But the upshot of this was but to deepen her yearning: if Sir\r\n",
      "Claude would only at last come the shillings would begin to ring. The\r\n",
      "companions paused, for want of one, before the Flowers of the Forest, a\r\n",
      "large presentment of bright brown ladies--they were brown all over--in\r\n",
      "a medium suggestive of tropical luxuriance, and there Maisie dolorously\r\n",
      "expressed her belief that he would never come at all. Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "hereupon, though discernibly disappointed, reminded her that he had not\r\n",
      "been promised as a certainty--a remark that caused the child to gaze at\r\n",
      "the Flowers through a blur in which they became more magnificent, yet\r\n",
      "oddly more confused, and by which moreover confusion was imparted to the\r\n",
      "aspect of a gentleman who at that moment, in the company of a lady, came\r\n",
      "out of the brilliant booth. The lady was so brown that Maisie at first\r\n",
      "took her for one of the Flowers; but during the few seconds that this\r\n",
      "required--a few seconds in which she had also desolately given up Sir\r\n",
      "Claude--she heard Mrs. Beale's voice, behind her, gather both wonder and\r\n",
      "pain into a single sharp little cry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of all the wickedness--BEALE!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had already, without distinguishing them in the mass of strollers,\r\n",
      "turned another way--it seemed at the brown lady's suggestion. Her course\r\n",
      "was marked, over heads and shoulders, by an upright scarlet plume, as to\r\n",
      "the ownership of which Maisie was instantly eager. \"Who is she--who is\r\n",
      "she?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mrs. Beale for a moment only looked after them. \"The liar--the\r\n",
      "liar!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie considered. \"Because he's not--where one thought?\" That was also,\r\n",
      "a month ago in Kensington Gardens, where her mother had not been.\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps he has come back,\" she was quick to contribute.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He never went--the hound!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That, according to Sir Claude, had been also what her mother had not\r\n",
      "done, and Maisie could only have a sense of something that in a maturer\r\n",
      "mind would be called the way history repeats itself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who IS she?\" she asked again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, fixed to the spot, seemed lost in the vision of an\r\n",
      "opportunity missed. \"If he had only seen me!\"--it came from between her\r\n",
      "teeth. \"She's a brand-new one. But he must have been with her since\r\n",
      "Tuesday.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie took it in. \"She's almost black,\" she then reported.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're always hideous,\" said Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a remark on which the child had again to reflect. \"Oh not his\r\n",
      "WIVES!\" she remonstrantly exclaimed. The words at another moment would\r\n",
      "probably have set her friend \"off,\" but Mrs. Beale was now, in her\r\n",
      "instant vigilance, too immensely \"on.\" \"Did you ever in your life see\r\n",
      "such a feather?\" Maisie presently continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This decoration appeared to have paused at some distance, and in spite\r\n",
      "of intervening groups they could both look at it. \"Oh that's the way\r\n",
      "they dress--the vulgarest of the vulgar!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're coming back--they'll see us!\" Maisie the next moment cried;\r\n",
      "and while her companion answered that this was exactly what she wanted\r\n",
      "and the child returned \"Here they are--here they are!\" the unconscious\r\n",
      "subjects of so much attention, with a change of mind about their\r\n",
      "direction, quickly retraced their steps and precipitated themselves upon\r\n",
      "their critics. Their unconsciousness gave Mrs. Beale time to leap, under\r\n",
      "her breath, to a recognition which Maisie caught.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It must be Mrs. Cuddon!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie looked at Mrs. Cuddon hard--her lips even echoed the name. What\r\n",
      "followed was extraordinarily rapid--a minute of livelier battle than had\r\n",
      "ever yet, in so short a span at least, been waged round our heroine. The\r\n",
      "muffled shock--lest people should notice--was violent, and it was only\r\n",
      "for her later thought that the steps fell into their order, the steps\r\n",
      "through which, in a bewilderment not so much of sound as of silence, she\r\n",
      "had come to find herself, too soon for comprehension and too strangely\r\n",
      "for fear, at the door of the Exhibition with her father. He thrust her\r\n",
      "into a hansom and got in after her, and then it was--as she drove along\r\n",
      "with him--that she recovered a little what had happened. Face to face\r\n",
      "with them in the gardens he had seen them, and there had been a moment\r\n",
      "of checked concussion during which, in a glare of black eyes and a\r\n",
      "toss of red plumage, Mrs. Cuddon had recognised them, ejaculated and\r\n",
      "vanished. There had been another moment at which she became aware of Sir\r\n",
      "Claude, also poised there in surprise, but out of her father's view, as\r\n",
      "if he had been warned off at the very moment of reaching them. It fell\r\n",
      "into its place with all the rest that she had heard Mrs. Beale say to\r\n",
      "her father, but whether low or loud was now lost to her, something\r\n",
      "about his having this time a new one; on which he had growled something\r\n",
      "indistinct but apparently in the tone and of the sort that the child,\r\n",
      "from her earliest years, had associated with hearing somebody retort\r\n",
      "to somebody that somebody was \"another.\" \"Oh I stick to the old!\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale had then quite loudly pronounced; and her accent, even as the cab\r\n",
      "got away, was still in the air, Maisie's effective companion having\r\n",
      "spoken no other word from the moment of whisking her off--none at least\r\n",
      "save the indistinguishable address which, over the top of the hansom and\r\n",
      "poised on the step, he had given the driver. Reconstructing these things\r\n",
      "later Maisie theorised that she at this point would have put a question\r\n",
      "to him had not the silence into which he charmed her or scared her--she\r\n",
      "could scarcely tell which--come from his suddenly making her feel his\r\n",
      "arm about her, feel, as he drew her close, that he was agitated in a way\r\n",
      "he had never yet shown her. It struck her he trembled, trembled too much\r\n",
      "to speak, and this had the effect of making her, with an emotion which,\r\n",
      "though it had begun to throb in an instant, was by no means all dread,\r\n",
      "conform to his portentous hush. The act of possession that his pressure\r\n",
      "in a manner advertised came back to her after the longest of the long\r\n",
      "intermissions that had ever let anything come back. They drove and\r\n",
      "drove, and he kept her close; she stared straight before her, holding\r\n",
      "her breath, watching one dark street succeed another and strangely\r\n",
      "conscious that what it all meant was somehow that papa was less to be\r\n",
      "left out of everything than she had supposed. It took her but a minute\r\n",
      "to surrender to this discovery, which, in the form of his present\r\n",
      "embrace, suggested a purpose in him prodigiously reaffirmed and with\r\n",
      "that a confused confidence. She neither knew exactly what he had done\r\n",
      "nor what he was doing; she could only, altogether impressed and rather\r\n",
      "proud, vibrate with the sense that he had jumped up to do something and\r\n",
      "that she had as quickly become a part of it. It was a part of it too\r\n",
      "that here they were at a house that seemed not large, but in the fresh\r\n",
      "white front of which the street-lamp showed a smartness of flower-boxes.\r\n",
      "The child had been in thousands of stories--all Mrs. Wix's and her own,\r\n",
      "to say nothing of the richest romances of French Elise--but she had\r\n",
      "never been in such a story as this. By the time he had helped her out\r\n",
      "of the cab, which drove away, and she heard in the door of the house\r\n",
      "the prompt little click of his key, the Arabian Nights had quite closed\r\n",
      "round her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From this minute that pitch of the wondrous was in everything,\r\n",
      "particularly in such an instant \"Open Sesame\" and in the departure of\r\n",
      "the cab, a rattling void filled with relinquished step-parents; it was,\r\n",
      "with the vividness, the almost blinding whiteness of the light that\r\n",
      "sprang responsive to papa's quick touch of a little brass knob on the\r\n",
      "wall, in a place that, at the top of a short soft staircase, struck her\r\n",
      "as the most beautiful she had ever seen in her life. The next thing she\r\n",
      "perceived it to be was the drawing-room of a lady--of a lady, she could\r\n",
      "see in a moment, and not of a gentleman, not even of one like papa\r\n",
      "himself or even like Sir Claude--whose things were as much prettier than\r\n",
      "mamma's as it had always had to be confessed that mamma's were prettier\r\n",
      "than Mrs. Beale's. In the middle of the small bright room and the\r\n",
      "presence of more curtains and cushions, more pictures and mirrors, more\r\n",
      "palm-trees drooping over brocaded and gilded nooks, more little silver\r\n",
      "boxes scattered over little crooked tables and little oval miniatures\r\n",
      "hooked upon velvet screens than Mrs. Beale and her ladyship together\r\n",
      "could, in an unnatural alliance, have dreamed of mustering, the child\r\n",
      "became aware, with a sharp foretaste of compassion, of something that\r\n",
      "was strangely like a relegation to obscurity of each of those women of\r\n",
      "taste. It was a stranger operation still that her father should on the\r\n",
      "spot be presented to her as quite advantageously and even grandly at\r\n",
      "home in the dazzling scene and himself by so much the more separated\r\n",
      "from scenes inferior to it. She spent with him in it, while explanations\r\n",
      "continued to hang back, twenty minutes that, in their sudden drop of\r\n",
      "danger, affected her, though there were neither buns nor ginger-beer,\r\n",
      "like an extemporised expensive treat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is she very rich?\" He had begun to strike her as almost embarrassed, so\r\n",
      "shy that he might have found himself with a young lady with whom he had\r\n",
      "little in common. She was literally moved by this apprehension to offer\r\n",
      "him some tactful relief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beale Farange stood and smiled at his young lady, his back to\r\n",
      "the fanciful fireplace, his light overcoat--the very lightest in\r\n",
      "London--wide open, and his wonderful lustrous beard completely\r\n",
      "concealing the expanse of his shirt-front. It pleased her more than ever\r\n",
      "to think that papa was handsome and, though as high aloft as mamma and\r\n",
      "almost, in his specially florid evening-dress, as splendid, of a beauty\r\n",
      "somehow less belligerent, less terrible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The Countess? Why do you ask me that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie's eyes opened wider. \"Is she a Countess?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed to treat her wonder as a positive tribute. \"Oh yes, my dear,\r\n",
      "but it isn't an English title.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her manner appreciated this. \"Is it a French one?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, nor French either. It's American.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She conversed agreeably. \"Ah then of course she must be rich.\" She took\r\n",
      "in such a combination of nationality and rank. \"I never saw anything so\r\n",
      "lovely.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Did you have a sight of her?\" Beale asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At the Exhibition?\" Maisie smiled. \"She was gone too quick.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father laughed. \"She did slope!\" She had feared he would say\r\n",
      "something about Mrs. Beale and Sir Claude, yet the way he spared them\r\n",
      "made her rather uneasy too. All he risked was, the next minute, \"She has\r\n",
      "a horror of vulgar scenes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was something she needn't take up; she could still continue bland.\r\n",
      "\"But where do you suppose she went?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I thought she'd have taken a cab and have been here by this time.\r\n",
      "But she'll turn up all right.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I HOPE she will,\" Maisie said; she spoke with an earnestness\r\n",
      "begotten of the impression of all the beauty about them, to which, in\r\n",
      "person, the Countess might make further contribution. \"We came awfully\r\n",
      "fast,\" she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father again laughed loud. \"Yes, my dear, I made you step out!\" He\r\n",
      "waited an instant, then pursued: \"I want her to see you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, at this, rejoiced in the attention that, for their evening out,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, even to the extent of personally \"doing up\" her old hat, had\r\n",
      "given her appearance. Meanwhile her father went on: \"You'll like her\r\n",
      "awfully.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I'm sure I shall!\" After which, either from the effect of having\r\n",
      "said so much or from that of a sudden glimpse of the impossibility of\r\n",
      "saying more, she felt an embarrassment and sought refuge in a minor\r\n",
      "branch of the subject. \"I thought she was Mrs. Cuddon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beale's gaiety rather increased than diminished. \"You mean my wife\r\n",
      "did? My dear child, my wife's a damned fool!\" He had the oddest air of\r\n",
      "speaking of his wife as of a person whom she might scarcely have known,\r\n",
      "so that the refuge of her scruple didn't prove particularly happy. Beale\r\n",
      "on the other hand appeared after an instant himself to feel a scruple.\r\n",
      "\"What I mean is, to speak seriously, that she doesn't really know\r\n",
      "anything about anything.\" He paused, following the child's charmed eyes\r\n",
      "and tentative step or two as they brought her nearer to the pretty\r\n",
      "things on one of the tables. \"She thinks she has good things, don't you\r\n",
      "know!\" He quite jeered at Mrs. Beale's delusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie felt she must confess that it WAS one; everything she had missed\r\n",
      "at the side-shows was made up to her by the Countess's luxuries. \"Yes,\"\r\n",
      "she considered; \"she does think that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was again a dryness in the way Beale replied that it didn't matter\r\n",
      "what she thought; but there was an increasing sweetness for his daughter\r\n",
      "in being with him so long without his doing anything worse. The whole\r\n",
      "hour of course was to remain with her, for days and weeks, ineffaceably\r\n",
      "illumined and confirmed; by the end of which she was able to read\r\n",
      "into it a hundred things that had been at the moment mere miraculous\r\n",
      "pleasantness. What they at the moment came to was simply that her\r\n",
      "companion was still in a good deal of a flutter, yet wished not to show\r\n",
      "it, and that just in proportion as he succeeded in this attempt he was\r\n",
      "able to encourage her to regard him as kind. He moved about the room\r\n",
      "after a little, showed her things, spoke to her as a person of taste,\r\n",
      "told her the name, which she remembered, of the famous French lady\r\n",
      "represented in one of the miniatures, and remarked, as if he had caught\r\n",
      "her wistful over a trinket or a trailing stuff, that he made no doubt\r\n",
      "the Countess, on coming in, would give her something jolly. He spied a\r\n",
      "pink satin box with a looking-glass let into the cover, which he raised,\r\n",
      "with a quick facetious flourish, to offer her the privilege of six rows\r\n",
      "of chocolate bonbons, cutting out thereby Sir Claude, who had never\r\n",
      "gone beyond four rows. \"I can do what I like with these,\" he said, \"for\r\n",
      "I don't mind telling you I gave 'em to her myself.\" The Countess had\r\n",
      "evidently appreciated the gift; there were numerous gaps, a ravage now\r\n",
      "quite unchecked, in the array. Even while they waited together Maisie\r\n",
      "had her sense, which was the mark of what their separation had become,\r\n",
      "of her having grown for him, since the last time he had, as it were,\r\n",
      "noticed her, and by increase of years and of inches if by nothing else,\r\n",
      "much more of a little person to reckon with. Yes, this was a part of\r\n",
      "the positive awkwardness that he carried off by being almost foolishly\r\n",
      "tender. There was a passage during which, on a yellow silk sofa under\r\n",
      "one of the palms, he had her on his knee, stroking her hair, playfully\r\n",
      "holding her off while he showed his shining fangs and let her, with\r\n",
      "a vague affectionate helpless pointless \"Dear old girl, dear little\r\n",
      "daughter,\" inhale the fragrance of his cherished beard. She must have\r\n",
      "been sorry for him, she afterwards knew, so well could she privately\r\n",
      "follow his difficulty in being specific to her about anything. She had\r\n",
      "such possibilities of vibration, of response, that it needed nothing\r\n",
      "more than this to make up to her in fact for omissions. The tears came\r\n",
      "into her eyes again as they had done when in the Park that day the\r\n",
      "Captain told her so \"splendidly\" that her mother was good. What was\r\n",
      "this but splendid too--this still directer goodness of her father and\r\n",
      "this unexampled shining solitude with him, out of which everything had\r\n",
      "dropped but that he was papa and that he was magnificent? It didn't\r\n",

      "purpose he didn't quite see his way to bring out, for in the freshness\r\n",
      "of their recovered fellowship she would have lent herself gleefully to\r\n",
      "his suggesting, or even to his pretending, that their relations were\r\n",
      "easy and graceful. There was something in him that seemed, and quite\r\n",
      "touchingly, to ask her to help him to pretend--pretend he knew enough\r\n",
      "about her life and her education, her means of subsistence and her view\r\n",
      "of himself, to give the questions he couldn't put her a natural domestic\r\n",
      "tone. She would have pretended with ecstasy if he could only have given\r\n",
      "her the cue. She waited for it while, between his big teeth, he breathed\r\n",
      "the sighs she didn't know to be stupid. And as if, though he was so\r\n",
      "stupid all through, he had let the friendly suffusion of her eyes yet\r\n",
      "tell him she was ready for anything, he floundered about, wondering what\r\n",
      "the devil he could lay hold of.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had lighted a cigarette and begun to smoke in her face it was as\r\n",
      "if he had struck with the match the note of some queer clumsy ferment\r\n",
      "of old professions, old scandals, old duties, a dim perception of what\r\n",
      "he possessed in her and what, if everything had only--damn it!--been\r\n",
      "totally different, she might still be able to give him. What she was\r\n",
      "able to give him, however, as his blinking eyes seemed to make out\r\n",
      "through the smoke, would be simply what he should be able to get from\r\n",
      "her. To give something, to give here on the spot, was all her own\r\n",
      "desire. Among the old things that came back was her little instinct of\r\n",
      "keeping the peace; it made her wonder more sharply what particular thing\r\n",
      "she could do or not do, what particular word she could speak or not\r\n",
      "speak, what particular line she could take or not take, that might for\r\n",
      "every one, even for the Countess, give a better turn to the crisis. She\r\n",
      "was ready, in this interest, for an immense surrender, a surrender of\r\n",
      "everything but Sir Claude, of everything but Mrs. Beale. The immensity\r\n",
      "didn't include THEM; but if he had an idea at the back of his head\r\n",
      "she had also one in a recess as deep, and for a time, while they sat\r\n",
      "together, there was an extraordinary mute passage between her vision\r\n",
      "of this vision of his, his vision of her vision, and her vision of his\r\n",
      "vision of her vision. What there was no effective record of indeed\r\n",
      "was the small strange pathos on the child's part of an innocence so\r\n",
      "saturated with knowledge and so directed to diplomacy. What, further,\r\n",
      "Beale finally laid hold of while he masked again with his fine presence\r\n",
      "half the flounces of the fireplace was: \"Do you know, my dear, I shall\r\n",
      "soon be off to America?\" It struck his daughter both as a short cut and\r\n",
      "as the way he wouldn't have said it to his wife. But his wife figured\r\n",
      "with a bright superficial assurance in her response.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean with Mrs. Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father looked at her hard. \"Don't be a little ass!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her silence appeared to represent a concentrated effort not to be. \"Then\r\n",
      "with the Countess?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With her or without her, my dear; that concerns only your poor daddy.\r\n",
      "She has big interests over there, and she wants me to take a look at\r\n",
      "them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie threw herself into them. \"Will that take very long?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; they're in such a muddle--it may take months. Now what I want to\r\n",
      "hear, you know, is whether you'd like to come along?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Planted once more before him in the middle of the room she felt herself\r\n",
      "turning white. \"I?\" she gasped, yet feeling as soon as she had spoken\r\n",
      "that such a note of dismay was not altogether pretty. She felt it still\r\n",
      "more while her father replied, with a shake of his legs, a toss of his\r\n",
      "cigarette-ash and a fidgety look--he was for ever taking one--all the\r\n",
      "length of his waistcoat and trousers, that she needn't be quite so\r\n",
      "disgusted. It helped her in a few seconds to appear more as he would\r\n",
      "like her that she saw, in the lovely light of the Countess's splendour,\r\n",
      "exactly, however she appeared, the right answer to make. \"Dear papa,\r\n",
      "I'll go with you anywhere.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned his back to her and stood with his nose at the glass of the\r\n",
      "chimneypiece while he brushed specks of ash out of his beard. Then he\r\n",
      "abruptly said: \"Do you know anything about your brute of a mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was just of her brute of a mother that the manner of the question in\r\n",
      "a remarkable degree reminded her: it had the free flight of one of Ida's\r\n",
      "fine bridgings of space. With the sense of this was kindled for Maisie\r\n",
      "at the same time an inspiration. \"Oh yes, I know everything!\" and she\r\n",
      "became so radiant that her father, seeing it in the mirror, turned back\r\n",
      "to her and presently, on the sofa, had her at his knee again and was\r\n",
      "again particularly affecting. Maisie's inspiration instructed her,\r\n",
      "pressingly, that the more she should be able to say about mamma the\r\n",
      "less she would be called upon to speak of her step-parents. She kept\r\n",
      "hoping the Countess would come in before her power to protect them was\r\n",
      "exhausted; and it was now, in closer quarters with her companion, that\r\n",
      "the idea at the back of her head shifted its place to her lips. She told\r\n",
      "him she had met her mother in the Park with a gentleman who, while Sir\r\n",
      "Claude had strolled with her ladyship, had been kind and had sat and\r\n",
      "talked to her; narrating the scene with a remembrance of her pledge of\r\n",
      "secrecy to the Captain quite brushed away by the joy of seeing Beale\r\n",
      "listen without profane interruption. It was almost an amazement, but it\r\n",
      "was indeed all a joy, thus to be able to guess that papa was at last\r\n",
      "quite tired of his anger--of his anger at any rate about mamma. He was\r\n",
      "only bored with her now. That made it, however, the more imperative that\r\n",
      "his spent displeasure shouldn't be blown out again. It charmed the child\r\n",
      "to see how much she could interest him; and the charm remained even\r\n",
      "when, after asking her a dozen questions, he observed musingly and a\r\n",
      "little obscurely: \"Yes, damned if she won't!\" For in this too there was\r\n",
      "a detachment, a wise weariness that made her feel safe. She had had\r\n",
      "to mention Sir Claude, though she mentioned him as little as possible\r\n",
      "and Beale only appeared to look quite over his head. It pieced itself\r\n",
      "together for her that this was the mildness of general indifference, a\r\n",
      "source of profit so great for herself personally that if the Countess\r\n",
      "was the author of it she was prepared literally to hug the Countess. She\r\n",
      "betrayed that eagerness by a restless question about her, to which her\r\n",
      "father replied: \"Oh she has a head on her shoulders. I'll back her to\r\n",
      "get out of anything!\" He looked at Maisie quite as if he could trace the\r\n",
      "connexion between her enquiry and the impatience of her gratitude. \"Do\r\n",
      "you mean to say you'd really come with me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She felt as if he were now looking at her very hard indeed, and also as\r\n",
      "if she had grown ever so much older. \"I'll do anything in the world you\r\n",
      "ask me, papa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave again, with a laugh and with his legs apart, his proprietary\r\n",
      "glance at his waistcoat and trousers. \"That's a way, my dear, of saying\r\n",
      "'No, thank you!' You know you don't want to go the least little mite.\r\n",
      "You can't humbug ME!\" Beale Farange laid down. \"I don't want to bully\r\n",
      "you--I never bullied you in my life; but I make you the offer, and it's\r\n",
      "to take or to leave. Your mother will never again have any more to do\r\n",
      "with you than if you were a kitchenmaid she had turned out for going\r\n",
      "wrong. Therefore of course I'm your natural protector and you've a right\r\n",
      "to get everything out of me you can. Now's your chance, you know--you\r\n",
      "won't be half-clever if you don't. You can't say I don't put it before\r\n",
      "you--you can't say I ain't kind to you or that I don't play fair. Mind\r\n",
      "you never say that, you know--it WOULD bring me down on you. I know\r\n",
      "what's proper. I'll take you again, just as I HAVE taken you again and\r\n",
      "again. And I'm much obliged to you for making up such a face.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was conscious enough that her face indeed couldn't please him if it\r\n",
      "showed any sign--just as she hoped it didn't--of her sharp impression of\r\n",
      "what he now really wanted to do. Wasn't he trying to turn the tables on\r\n",
      "her, embarrass her somehow into admitting that what would really suit\r\n",
      "her little book would be, after doing so much for good manners, to leave\r\n",
      "her wholly at liberty to arrange for herself? She began to be nervous\r\n",
      "again: it rolled over her that this was their parting, their parting\r\n",
      "for ever, and that he had brought her there for so many caresses only\r\n",
      "because it was important such an occasion should look better for him\r\n",
      "than any other. For her to spoil it by the note of discord would\r\n",
      "certainly give him ground for complaint; and the child was momentarily\r\n",
      "bewildered between her alternatives of agreeing with him about her\r\n",
      "wanting to get rid of him and displeasing him by pretending to stick\r\n",
      "to him. So she found for the moment no solution but to murmur very\r\n",
      "helplessly: \"Oh papa--oh papa!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know what you're up to--don't tell ME!\" After which he came straight\r\n",
      "over and, in the most inconsequent way in the world, clasped her in\r\n",
      "his arms a moment and rubbed his beard against her cheek. Then she\r\n",
      "understood as well as if he had spoken it that what he wanted, hang\r\n",
      "it, was that she should let him off with all the honours--with all\r\n",
      "the appearance of virtue and sacrifice on his side. It was exactly as\r\n",
      "if he had broken out to her: \"I say, you little booby, help me to be\r\n",
      "irreproachable, to be noble, and yet to have none of the beastly bore of\r\n",
      "it. There's only impropriety enough for one of us; so YOU must take it\r\n",
      "all. REPUDIATE your dear old daddy--in the face, mind you, of his tender\r\n",
      "supplications. He can't be rough with you--it isn't in his nature:\r\n",
      "therefore you'll have successfully chucked him because he was too\r\n",
      "generous to be as firm with you, poor man, as was, after all, his duty.\"\r\n",
      "This was what he communicated in a series of tremendous pats on the\r\n",
      "back; that portion of her person had never been so thumped since Moddle\r\n",
      "thumped her when she choked. After a moment he gave her the further\r\n",
      "impression of having become sure enough of her to be able very\r\n",
      "gracefully to say out: \"You know your mother loathes you, loathes you\r\n",
      "simply. And I've been thinking over your precious man--the fellow you\r\n",
      "told me about.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" Maisie replied with competence, \"I'm sure of HIM.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father was vague for an instant. \"Do you mean sure of his liking\r\n",
      "you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no; of his liking HER!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beale had a return of gaiety. \"There's no accounting for tastes! It's\r\n",
      "what they all say, you know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't care--I'm sure of him!\" Maisie repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sure, you mean, that she'll bolt?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie knew all about bolting, but, decidedly, she WAS older, and there\r\n",
      "was something in her that could wince at the way her father made the\r\n",
      "ugly word--ugly enough at best--sound flat and low. It prompted her to\r\n",
      "amend his allusion, which she did by saying: \"I don't know what she'll\r\n",
      "do. But she'll be happy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us hope so,\" said Beale--almost as for edification. \"The more happy\r\n",
      "she is at any rate the less she'll want you about. That's why I press\r\n",
      "you,\" he agreeably pursued, \"to consider this handsome offer--I mean\r\n",
      "seriously, you know--of your sole surviving parent.\" Their eyes, at\r\n",
      "this, met again in a long and extraordinary communion which terminated\r\n",
      "in his ejaculating: \"Ah you little scoundrel!\" She took it from him in\r\n",
      "the manner it seemed to her he would like best and with a success that\r\n",
      "encouraged him to go on: \"You ARE a deep little devil!\" Her silence,\r\n",
      "ticking like a watch, acknowledged even this, in confirmation of which\r\n",
      "he finally brought out: \"You've settled it with the other pair!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what if I have?\" She sounded to herself most bold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father, quite as in the old days, broke into a peal. \"Why, don't you\r\n",
      "know they're awful?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She grew bolder still. \"I don't care--not a bit!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But they're probably the worst people in the world and the very\r\n",
      "greatest criminals,\" Beale pleasantly urged. \"I'm not the man, my dear,\r\n",
      "not to let you know it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it doesn't prevent them from loving me. They love me\r\n",
      "tremendously.\" Maisie turned crimson to hear herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion fumbled; almost any one--let alone a daughter--would\r\n",
      "have seen how conscientious he wanted to be. \"I dare say. But do you\r\n",
      "know why?\" She braved his eyes and he added: \"You're a jolly good\r\n",
      "pretext.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For what?\" Maisie asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, for their game. I needn't tell you what that is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child reflected. \"Well then that's all the more reason.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Reason for what, pray?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For their being kind to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And for your keeping in with them?\" Beale roared again; it was as if\r\n",
      "his spirits rose and rose. \"Do you realise, pray, that in saying that\r\n",
      "you're a monster?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned it over. \"A monster?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They've MADE one of you. Upon my honour it's quite awful. It shows\r\n",
      "the kind of people they are. Don't you understand,\" Beale pursued,\r\n",
      "\"that when they've made you as horrid as they can--as horrid as\r\n",
      "themselves--they'll just simply chuck you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had at this a flicker of passion. \"They WON'T chuck me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon,\" her father courteously insisted; \"it's my duty to\r\n",
      "put it before you. I shouldn't forgive myself if I didn't point out to\r\n",
      "you that they'll cease to require you.\" He spoke as if with an appeal to\r\n",
      "her intelligence that she must be ashamed not adequately to meet, and\r\n",
      "this gave a real distinction to his superior delicacy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It cleared the case as he had wished. \"Cease to require me because they\r\n",
      "won't care?\" She paused with that sketch of her idea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"OF COURSE Sir Claude won't care if his wife bolts. That's his game. It\r\n",
      "will suit him down to the ground.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a proposition Maisie could perfectly embrace, but it still left\r\n",
      "a loophole for triumph. She turned it well over. \"You mean if mamma\r\n",
      "doesn't come back ever at all?\" The composure with which her face was\r\n",
      "presented to that prospect would have shown a spectator the long road\r\n",
      "she had travelled. \"Well, but that won't put Mrs. Beale--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the same comfortable position--?\" Beale took her up with relish; he\r\n",
      "had sprung to his feet again, shaking his legs and looking at his shoes.\r\n",
      "\"Right you are, darling! Something more will be wanted for Mrs. Beale.\"\r\n",
      "He just paused, then he added: \"But she may not have long to wait for\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie also for a minute looked at his shoes, though they were not the\r\n",
      "pair she most admired, the laced yellow \"uppers\" and patent-leather\r\n",
      "complement. At last, with a question, she raised her eyes. \"Aren't you\r\n",
      "coming back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more he hung fire; after which he gave a small laugh that in the\r\n",
      "oddest way in the world reminded her of the unique sounds she had\r\n",
      "heard emitted by Mrs. Wix. \"It may strike you as extraordinary that I\r\n",
      "should make you such an admission; and in point of fact you're not to\r\n",
      "understand that I do. But we'll put it that way to help your decision.\r\n",
      "The point is that that's the way my wife will presently be sure to put\r\n",
      "it. You'll hear her shrieking that she's deserted, so that she may just\r\n",
      "pile up her wrongs. She'll be as free as she likes then--as free, you\r\n",
      "see, as your mother's muff of a husband. They won't have anything more\r\n",
      "to consider and they'll just put you into the street. Do I understand,\"\r\n",
      "Beale enquired, \"that, in the face of what I press on you, you still\r\n",
      "prefer to take the risk of that?\" It was the most wonderful appeal any\r\n",
      "gentleman had ever addressed to his daughter, and it had placed Maisie\r\n",
      "in the middle of the room again while her father moved slowly about her\r\n",
      "with his hands in his pockets and something in his step that seemed,\r\n",
      "more than anything else he had done, to show the habit of the place.\r\n",
      "She turned her fevered little eyes over his friend's brightnesses, as\r\n",
      "if, on her own side, to press for some help in a quandary unexampled.\r\n",
      "As if also the pressure reached him he after an instant stopped short,\r\n",
      "completing the prodigy of his attitude and the pride of his loyalty by\r\n",
      "a supreme formulation of the general inducement. \"You've an eye, love!\r\n",
      "Yes, there's money. No end of money.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This affected her at first in the manner of some great flashing dazzle\r\n",
      "in one of the pantomimes to which Sir Claude had taken her: she saw\r\n",
      "nothing in it but what it directly conveyed. \"And shall I never, never\r\n",
      "see you again--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I do go to America?\" Beale brought it out like a man. \"Never, never,\r\n",
      "never!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hereupon, with the utmost absurdity, she broke down; everything gave\r\n",
      "way, everything but the horror of hearing herself definitely utter such\r\n",
      "an ugliness as the acceptance of that. So she only stiffened herself and\r\n",
      "said: \"Then I can't give you up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She held him some seconds looking at her, showing her a strained\r\n",
      "grimace, a perfect parade of all his teeth, in which it seemed to her\r\n",
      "she could read the disgust he didn't quite like to express at this\r\n",
      "departure from the pliability she had practically promised. But before\r\n",
      "she could attenuate in any way the crudity of her collapse he gave an\r\n",
      "impatient jerk which took him to the window. She heard a vehicle stop;\r\n",
      "Beale looked out; then he freshly faced her. He still said nothing, but\r\n",
      "she knew the Countess had come back. There was a silence again between\r\n",
      "them, but with a different shade of embarrassment from that of their\r\n",
      "united arrival; and it was still without speaking that, abruptly\r\n",
      "repeating one of the embraces of which he had already been so prodigal,\r\n",
      "he whisked her back to the lemon sofa just before the door of the room\r\n",
      "was thrown open. It was thus in renewed and intimate union with him that\r\n",
      "she was presented to a person whom she instantly recognised as the brown\r\n",
      "lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The brown lady looked almost as astonished, though not quite as alarmed,\r\n",
      "as when, at the Exhibition, she had gasped in the face of Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "Maisie in truth almost gasped in her own; this was with the fuller\r\n",
      "perception that she was brown indeed. She literally struck the child\r\n",
      "more as an animal than as a \"real\" lady; she might have been a clever\r\n",
      "frizzled poodle in a frill or a dreadful human monkey in a spangled\r\n",
      "petticoat. She had a nose that was far too big and eyes that were far\r\n",
      "too small and a moustache that was, well, not so happy a feature as Sir\r\n",
      "Claude's. Beale jumped up to her; while, to the child's astonishment,\r\n",
      "though as if in a quick intensity of thought, the Countess advanced as\r\n",
      "gaily as if, for many a day, nothing awkward had happened for any one.\r\n",
      "Maisie, in spite of a large acquaintance with the phenomenon, had\r\n",
      "never seen it so promptly established that nothing awkward was to be\r\n",
      "mentioned. The next minute the Countess had kissed her and exclaimed to\r\n",
      "Beale with bright tender reproach: \"Why, you never told me HALF! My dear\r\n",
      "child,\" she cried, \"it was awfully nice of you to come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But she hasn't come--she won't come!\" Beale answered. \"I've put it to\r\n",
      "her how much you'd like it, but she declines to have anything to do with\r\n",
      "us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Countess stood smiling, and after an instant that was mainly taken\r\n",
      "up with the shock of her weird aspect Maisie felt herself reminded\r\n",
      "of another smile, which was not ugly, though also interested--the\r\n",
      "kind light thrown, that day in the Park, from the clean fair face of\r\n",
      "the Captain. Papa's Captain--yes--was the Countess; but she wasn't\r\n",
      "nearly so nice as the other: it all came back, doubtless, to Maisie's\r\n",
      "minor appreciation of ladies. \"Shouldn't you like me,\" said this one\r\n",
      "endearingly, \"to take you to Spa?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Spa?\" The child repeated the name to gain time, not to show how the\r\n",
      "Countess brought back to her a dim remembrance of a strange woman with a\r\n",
      "horrid face who once, years before, in an omnibus, bending to her from\r\n",
      "an opposite seat, had suddenly produced an orange and murmured \"Little\r\n",
      "dearie, won't you have it?\" She had felt then, for some reason, a small\r\n",
      "silly terror, though afterwards conscious that her interlocutress,\r\n",
      "unfortunately hideous, had particularly meant to be kind. This was also\r\n",
      "what the Countess meant; yet the few words she had uttered and the smile\r\n",
      "with which she had uttered them immediately cleared everything up. Oh\r\n",
      "no, she wanted to go nowhere with HER, for her presence had already, in\r\n",
      "a few seconds, dissipated the happy impression of the room and put an\r\n",
      "end to the pleasure briefly taken in Beale's command of such elegance.\r\n",
      "There was no command of elegance in his having exposed her to the\r\n",
      "approach of the short fat wheedling whiskered person in whom she had now\r\n",
      "to recognise the only figure wholly without attraction involved in any\r\n",
      "of the intimate connexions her immediate circle had witnessed the growth\r\n",
      "of. She was abashed meanwhile, however, at having appeared to weigh in\r\n",
      "the balance the place to which she had been invited; and she added as\r\n",
      "quickly as possible: \"It isn't to America then?\" The Countess, at this,\r\n",
      "looked sharply at Beale, and Beale, airily enough, asked what the deuce\r\n",
      "it mattered when she had already given him to understand she wanted to\r\n",
      "have nothing to do with them. There followed between her companions a\r\n",
      "passage of which the sense was drowned for her in the deepening inward\r\n",
      "hum of her mere desire to get off; though she was able to guess later\r\n",
      "on that her father must have put it to his friend that it was no use\r\n",
      "talking, that she was an obstinate little pig and that, besides, she\r\n",
      "was really old enough to choose for herself. It glimmered back to her\r\n",
      "indeed that she must have failed quite dreadfully to seem ideally other\r\n",
      "than rude, inasmuch as before she knew it she had visibly given the\r\n",
      "impression that if they didn't allow her to go home she should cry. Oh\r\n",
      "if there had ever been a thing to cry about it was being so consciously\r\n",
      "and gawkily below the handsomest offers any one could ever have\r\n",
      "received. The great pain of the thing was that she could see the\r\n",
      "Countess liked her enough to wish to be liked in return, and it was from\r\n",
      "the idea of a return she sought utterly to flee. It was the idea of a\r\n",
      "return that after a confusion of loud words had broken out between the\r\n",
      "others brought to her lips with the tremor preceding disaster: \"Can't\r\n",
      "I, please, be sent home in a cab?\" Yes, the Countess wanted her and the\r\n",
      "Countess was wounded and chilled, and she couldn't help it, and it was\r\n",
      "all the more dreadful because it only made the Countess more coaxing and\r\n",
      "more impossible. The only thing that sustained either of them perhaps\r\n",
      "till the cab came--Maisie presently saw it would come--was its being\r\n",
      "in the air somehow that Beale had done what he wanted. He went out to\r\n",
      "look for a conveyance; the servants, he said, had gone to bed, but she\r\n",
      "shouldn't be kept beyond her time. The Countess left the room with him,\r\n",
      "and, alone in the possession of it, Maisie hoped she wouldn't come\r\n",
      "back. It was all the effect of her face--the child simply couldn't look\r\n",
      "at it and meet its expression halfway. All in a moment too that queer\r\n",
      "expression had leaped into the lovely things--all in a moment she had\r\n",
      "had to accept her father as liking some one whom she was sure neither\r\n",
      "her mother, nor Mrs. Beale, nor Mrs. Wix, nor Sir Claude, nor the\r\n",
      "Captain, nor even Mr. Perriam and Lord Eric could possibly have liked.\r\n",
      "Three minutes later, downstairs, with the cab at the door, it was\r\n",
      "perhaps as a final confession of not having much to boast of that, on\r\n",
      "taking leave of her, he managed to press her to his bosom without her\r\n",
      "seeing his face. For herself she was so eager to go that their parting\r\n",
      "reminded her of nothing, not even of a single one of all the \"nevers\"\r\n",
      "that above, as the penalty of not cleaving to him, he had attached to\r\n",
      "the question of their meeting again. There was something in the Countess\r\n",
      "that falsified everything, even the great interests in America and yet\r\n",
      "more the first flush of that superiority to Mrs. Beale and to mamma\r\n",
      "which had been expressed in Sevres sets and silver boxes. These were\r\n",
      "still there, but perhaps there were no great interests in America.\r\n",
      "Mamma had known an American who was not a bit like this one. She was\r\n",
      "not, however, of noble rank; her name was only Mrs. Tucker. Maisie's\r\n",
      "detachment would none the less have been more complete if she had not\r\n",
      "suddenly had to exclaim: \"Oh dear, I haven't any money!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father's teeth, at this, were such a picture of appetite without\r\n",
      "action as to be a match for any plea of poverty. \"Make your stepmother\r\n",
      "pay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stepmothers DON'T pay!\" cried the Countess. \"No stepmother ever paid\r\n",
      "in her life!\" The next moment they were in the street together, and the\r\n",
      "next the child was in the cab, with the Countess, on the pavement, but\r\n",
      "close to her, quickly taking money from a purse whisked out of a pocket.\r\n",
      "Her father had vanished and there was even yet nothing in that to\r\n",
      "reawaken the pang of loss. \"Here's money,\" said the brown lady: \"go!\"\r\n",
      "The sound was commanding: the cab rattled off. Maisie sat there with her\r\n",
      "hand full of coin. All that for a cab? As they passed a street-lamp she\r\n",
      "bent to see how much. What she saw was a cluster of sovereigns. There\r\n",
      "MUST then have been great interests in America. It was still at any rate\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "XX\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The money was far too much even for a fee in a fairy-tale, and in the\r\n",
      "absence of Mrs. Beale, who, though the hour was now late, had not yet\r\n",
      "returned to the Regent's Park, Susan Ash, in the hall, as loud as Maisie\r\n",
      "was low and as bold as she was bland, produced, on the exhibition\r\n",
      "offered under the dim vigil of the lamp that made the place a\r\n",
      "contrast to the child's recent scene of light, the half-crown that an\r\n",
      "unsophisticated cabman could pronounce to be the least he would take. It\r\n",
      "was apparently long before Mrs. Beale would arrive, and in the interval\r\n",
      "Maisie had been induced by the prompt Susan not only to go to bed like\r\n",
      "a darling dear, but, in still richer expression of that character, to\r\n",
      "devote to the repayment of obligations general as well as particular\r\n",
      "one of the sovereigns in the ordered array that, on the dressing-table\r\n",
      "upstairs, was naturally not less dazzling to a lone orphan of a\r\n",
      "housemaid than to the subject of the manoeuvres of a quartette. This\r\n",
      "subject went to sleep with her property gathered into a knotted\r\n",
      "handkerchief, the largest that could be produced and lodged under her\r\n",
      "pillow; but the explanations that on the morrow were inevitably more\r\n",
      "complete with Mrs. Beale than they had been with her humble friend\r\n",
      "found their climax in a surrender also more becomingly free. There were\r\n",
      "explanations indeed that Mrs. Beale had to give as well as to ask, and\r\n",
      "the most striking of these was to the effect that it was dreadful for\r\n",
      "a little girl to take money from a woman who was simply the vilest of\r\n",
      "their sex. The sovereigns were examined with some attention, the result\r\n",
      "of which, however, was to make the author of that statement desire to\r\n",
      "know what, if one really went into the matter, they could be called\r\n",
      "but the wages of sin. Her companion went into it merely so far as the\r\n",
      "question of what then they were to do with them; on which Mrs. Beale,\r\n",
      "who had by this time put them into her pocket, replied with dignity\r\n",
      "and with her hand on the place: \"We're to send them back on the spot!\"\r\n",
      "Susan, the child soon afterwards learnt, had been invited to contribute\r\n",
      "to this act of restitution her one appropriated coin; but a closer\r\n",
      "clutch of the treasure showed in her private assurance to Maisie that\r\n",
      "there was a limit to the way she could be \"done.\" Maisie had been open\r\n",
      "with Mrs. Beale about the whole of last night's transaction; but she\r\n",
      "now found herself on the part of their indignant inferior a recipient\r\n",
      "of remarks that were so many ringing tokens of that lady's own\r\n",
      "suppressions. One of these bore upon the extraordinary hour--it was\r\n",
      "three in the morning if she really wanted to know--at which Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "had re-entered the house; another, in accents as to which Maisie's\r\n",
      "criticism was still intensely tacit, characterised her appeal as such\r\n",
      "a \"gime,\" such a \"shime,\" as one had never had to put up with; a\r\n",
      "third treated with some vigour the question of the enormous sums due\r\n",
      "belowstairs, in every department, for gratuitous labour and wasted zeal.\r\n",
      "Our young lady's consciousness was indeed mainly filled for several\r\n",
      "days with the apprehension created by the too slow subsidence of her\r\n",
      "attendant's sense of wrong. These days would become terrific like the\r\n",
      "Revolutions she had learnt by heart in Histories if an outbreak in the\r\n",
      "kitchen should crown them; and to promote that prospect she had through\r\n",
      "Susan's eyes more than one glimpse of the way in which Revolutions are\r\n",
      "prepared. To listen to Susan was to gather that the spark applied to\r\n",
      "the inflammables and already causing them to crackle would prove to\r\n",
      "have been the circumstance of one's being called a horrid low thief for\r\n",
      "refusing to part with one's own. The redeeming point of this tension\r\n",
      "was, on the fifth day, that it actually appeared to have had to do with\r\n",
      "a breathless perception in our heroine's breast that scarcely more as\r\n",
      "the centre of Sir Claude's than as that of Susan's energies she had soon\r\n",
      "after breakfast been conveyed from London to Folkestone and established\r\n",
      "at a lovely hotel. These agents, before her wondering eyes, had combined\r\n",
      "to carry through the adventure and to give it the air of having owed\r\n",
      "its success to the fact that Mrs. Beale had, as Susan said, but just\r\n",
      "stepped out. When Sir Claude, watch in hand, had met this fact with the\r\n",
      "exclamation \"Then pack Miss Farange and come off with us!\" there had\r\n",
      "ensued on the stairs a series of gymnastics of a nature to bring Miss\r\n",
      "Farange's heart into Miss Farange's mouth. She sat with Sir Claude in\r\n",
      "a four-wheeler while he still held his watch; held it longer than any\r\n",
      "doctor who had ever felt her pulse; long enough to give her a vision\r\n",
      "of something like the ecstasy of neglecting such an opportunity to\r\n",
      "show impatience. The ecstasy had begun in the schoolroom and over the\r\n",
      "Berceuse, quite in the manner of the same foretaste on the day, a little\r\n",
      "while back, when Susan had panted up and she herself, after the hint\r\n",
      "about the duchess, had sailed down; for what harm then had there been in\r\n",
      "drops and disappointments if she could still have, even only a moment,\r\n",
      "the sensation of such a name \"brought up\"? It had remained with her that\r\n",
      "her father had foretold her she would some day be in the street, but it\r\n",
      "clearly wouldn't be this day, and she felt justified of the preference\r\n",
      "betrayed to that parent as soon as her visitor had set Susan in motion\r\n",
      "and laid his hand, while she waited with him, kindly on her own. This\r\n",
      "was what the Captain, in Kensington Gardens, had done; her present\r\n",
      "situation reminded her a little of that one and renewed the dim wonder\r\n",
      "of the fashion after which, from the first, such pats and pulls had\r\n",
      "struck her as the steps and signs of other people's business and even a\r\n",
      "little as the wriggle or the overflow of their difficulties. What had\r\n",
      "failed her and what had frightened her on the night of the Exhibition\r\n",
      "lost themselves at present alike in the impression that any \"surprise\"\r\n",
      "now about to burst from Sir Claude would be too big to burst all at\r\n",
      "once. Any awe that might have sprung from his air of leaving out her\r\n",
      "stepmother was corrected by the force of a general rule, the odd truth\r\n",
      "that if Mrs. Beale now never came nor went without making her think of\r\n",
      "him, it was never, to balance that, the main mark of his own renewed\r\n",
      "reality to appear to be a reference to Mrs. Beale. To be with Sir Claude\r\n",
      "was to think of Sir Claude, and that law governed Maisie's mind until,\r\n",
      "through a sudden lurch of the cab, which had at last taken in Susan and\r\n",
      "ever so many bundles and almost reached Charing Cross, it popped again\r\n",
      "somehow into her dizzy head the long-lost image of Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was singular, but from this time she understood and she followed,\r\n",
      "followed with the sense of an ample filling-out of any void created by\r\n",
      "symptoms of avoidance and of flight. Her ecstasy was a thing that had\r\n",
      "yet more of a face than of a back to turn, a pair of eyes still directed\r\n",
      "to Mrs. Wix even after the slight surprise of their not finding her, as\r\n",
      "the journey expanded, either at the London station or at the Folkestone\r\n",
      "hotel. It took few hours to make the child feel that if she was in\r\n",
      "neither of these places she was at least everywhere else. Maisie had\r\n",
      "known all along a great deal, but never so much as she was to know from\r\n",
      "this moment on and as she learned in particular during the couple of\r\n",
      "days that she was to hang in the air, as it were, over the sea which\r\n",
      "represented in breezy blueness and with a summer charm a crossing of\r\n",
      "more spaces than the Channel. It was granted her at this time to arrive\r\n",
      "at divinations so ample that I shall have no room for the goal if I\r\n",
      "attempt to trace the stages; as to which therefore I must be content to\r\n",
      "say that the fullest expression we may give to Sir Claude's conduct is\r\n",
      "a poor and pale copy of the picture it presented to his young friend.\r\n",
      "Abruptly, that morning, he had yielded to the action of the idea pumped\r\n",
      "into him for weeks by Mrs. Wix on lines of approach that she had been\r\n",
      "capable of the extraordinary art of preserving from entanglement in\r\n",
      "the fine network of his relations with Mrs. Beale. The breath of her\r\n",
      "sincerity, blowing without a break, had puffed him up to the flight\r\n",
      "by which, in the degree I have indicated, Maisie too was carried off\r\n",
      "her feet. This consisted neither in more nor in less than the brave\r\n",
      "stroke of his getting off from Mrs. Beale as well as from his wife--of\r\n",
      "making with the child straight for some such foreign land as would\r\n",
      "give a support to Mrs. Wix's dream that she might still see his\r\n",
      "errors renounced and his delinquencies redeemed. It would all be a\r\n",
      "sacrifice--under eyes that would miss no faintest shade--to what even\r\n",
      "the strange frequenters of her ladyship's earlier period used to call\r\n",
      "the real good of the little unfortunate. Maisie's head held a suspicion\r\n",
      "of much that, during the last long interval, had confusedly, but quite\r\n",
      "candidly, come and gone in his own; a glimpse, almost awe-stricken in\r\n",
      "its gratitude, of the miracle her old governess had wrought. That\r\n",
      "functionary could not in this connexion have been more impressive, even\r\n",
      "at second-hand, if she had been a prophetess with an open scroll or some\r\n",
      "ardent abbess speaking with the lips of the Church. She had clung day\r\n",
      "by day to their plastic associate, plying him with her deep, narrow\r\n",
      "passion, doing her simple utmost to convert him, and so working on him\r\n",
      "that he had at last really embraced his fine chance. That the chance was\r\n",
      "not delusive was sufficiently guaranteed by the completeness with which\r\n",
      "he could finally figure it out that, in case of his taking action,\r\n",
      "neither Ida nor Beale, whose book, on each side, it would only too well\r\n",
      "suit, would make any sort of row.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It sounds, no doubt, too penetrating, but it was not all as an effect of\r\n",
      "Sir Claude's betrayals that Maisie was able to piece together the beauty\r\n",
      "of the special influence through which, for such stretches of time,\r\n",
      "he had refined upon propriety by keeping, so far as possible, his\r\n",
      "sentimental interests distinct. She had ever of course in her mind fewer\r\n",
      "names than conceptions, but it was only with this drawback that she now\r\n",
      "made out her companion's absences to have had for their ground that he\r\n",
      "was the lover of her stepmother and that the lover of her stepmother\r\n",
      "could scarce logically pretend to a superior right to look after her.\r\n",
      "Maisie had by this time embraced the implication of a kind of natural\r\n",
      "divergence between lovers and little girls. It was just this indeed\r\n",
      "that could throw light on the probable contents of the pencilled note\r\n",
      "deposited on the hall-table in the Regent's Park and which would greet\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale on her return. Maisie freely figured it as provisionally\r\n",
      "jocular in tone, even though to herself on this occasion Sir Claude\r\n",
      "turned a graver face than he had shown in any crisis but that of putting\r\n",
      "her into the cab when she had been horrid to him after her parting with\r\n",
      "the Captain. He might really be embarrassed, but he would be sure, to\r\n",
      "her view, to have muffled in some bravado of pleasantry the disturbance\r\n",
      "produced at her father's by the removal of a valued servant. Not that\r\n",
      "there wasn't a great deal too that wouldn't be in the note--a great deal\r\n",
      "for which a more comfortable place was Maisie's light little brain,\r\n",
      "where it hummed away hour after hour and caused the first outlook at\r\n",
      "Folkestone to swim in a softness of colour and sound. It became clear in\r\n",
      "this medium that her stepfather had really now only to take into account\r\n",
      "his entanglement with Mrs. Beale. Wasn't he at last disentangled from\r\n",
      "every one and every thing else? The obstacle to the rupture pressed upon\r\n",
      "him by Mrs. Wix in the interest of his virtue would be simply that he\r\n",
      "was in love, or rather, to put it more precisely, that Mrs. Beale had\r\n",
      "left him no doubt of the degree in which SHE was. She was so much so as\r\n",
      "to have succeeded in making him accept for a time her infatuated grasp\r\n",
      "of him and even to some extent the idea of what they yet might do\r\n",
      "together with a little diplomacy and a good deal of patience. I may not\r\n",
      "even answer for it that Maisie was not aware of how, in this, Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "failed to share his all but insurmountable distaste for their allowing\r\n",
      "their little charge to breathe the air of their gross irregularity--his\r\n",
      "contention, in a word, that they should either cease to be irregular\r\n",
      "or cease to be parental. Their little charge, for herself, had long\r\n",
      "ago adopted the view that even Mrs. Wix had at one time not thought\r\n",
      "prohibitively coarse--the view that she was after all, AS a little\r\n",
      "charge, morally at home in atmospheres it would be appalling to analyse.\r\n",
      "If Mrs. Wix, however, ultimately appalled, had now set her heart on\r\n",
      "strong measures, Maisie, as I have intimated, could also work round both\r\n",
      "to the reasons for them and to the quite other reasons for that lady's\r\n",
      "not, as yet at least, appearing in them at first-hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh decidedly I shall never get you to believe the number of things she\r\n",
      "saw and the number of secrets she discovered! Why in the world, for\r\n",
      "instance, couldn't Sir Claude have kept it from her--except on the\r\n",
      "hypothesis of his not caring to--that, when you came to look at it and\r\n",
      "so far as it was a question of vested interests, he had quite as much\r\n",
      "right in her as her stepmother, not to say a right that Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "was in no position to dispute? He failed at all events of any such\r\n",
      "successful ambiguity as could keep her, when once they began to look\r\n",
      "across at France, from regarding even what was least explained as most\r\n",
      "in the spirit of their old happy times, their rambles and expeditions in\r\n",
      "the easier better days of their first acquaintance. Never before had she\r\n",
      "had so the sense of giving him a lead for the sort of treatment of what\r\n",
      "was between them that would best carry it off, or of his being grateful\r\n",
      "to her for meeting him so much in the right place. She met him literally\r\n",
      "at the very point where Mrs. Beale was most to be reckoned with, the\r\n",
      "point of the jealousy that was sharp in that lady and of the need of\r\n",
      "their keeping it as long as possible obscure to her that poor Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "had still a hand. Yes, she met him too in the truth of the matter that,\r\n",
      "as her stepmother had had no one else to be jealous of, she had made\r\n",
      "up for so gross a privation by directing the sentiment to a moral\r\n",
      "influence. Sir Claude appeared absolutely to convey in a wink that\r\n",
      "a moral influence capable of pulling a string was after all a moral\r\n",
      "influence exposed to the scratching out of its eyes; and that, this\r\n",
      "being the case, there was somebody they couldn't afford to leave\r\n",
      "unprotected before they should see a little better what Mrs. Beale was\r\n",
      "likely to do. Maisie, true enough, had not to put it into words to\r\n",
      "rejoin, in the coffee-room, at luncheon: \"What CAN she do but come to\r\n",
      "you if papa does take a step that will amount to legal desertion?\"\r\n",
      "Neither had he then, in answer, to articulate anything but the jollity\r\n",
      "of their having found a table at a window from which, as they partook of\r\n",
      "cold beef and apollinaris--for he hinted they would have to save lots\r\n",
      "of money--they could let their eyes hover tenderly on the far-off white\r\n",
      "cliffs that so often had signalled to the embarrassed English a promise\r\n",
      "of safety. Maisie stared at them as if she might really make out after a\r\n",
      "little a queer dear figure perched on them--a figure as to which she had\r\n",
      "already the subtle sense that, wherever perched, it would be the very\r\n",
      "oddest yet seen in France. But it was at least as exciting to feel where\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix wasn't as it would have been to know where she was, and if she\r\n",
      "wasn't yet at Boulogne this only thickened the plot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If she was not to be seen that day, however, the evening was marked by\r\n",
      "an apparition before which, none the less, overstrained suspense folded\r\n",
      "on the spot its wings. Adjusting her respirations and attaching, under\r\n",
      "dropped lashes, all her thoughts to a smartness of frock and frill for\r\n",
      "which she could reflect that she had not appealed in vain to a loyalty\r\n",
      "in Susan Ash triumphant over the nice things their feverish flight had\r\n",
      "left behind, Maisie spent on a bench in the garden of the hotel the\r\n",
      "half-hour before dinner, that mysterious ceremony of the _table d'hote_\r\n",
      "for which she had prepared with a punctuality of flutter. Sir Claude,\r\n",
      "beside her, was occupied with a cigarette and the afternoon papers; and\r\n",
      "though the hotel was full the garden shewed the particular void that\r\n",
      "ensues upon the sound of the dressing-bell. She had almost had time to\r\n",
      "weary of the human scene; her own humanity at any rate, in the shape of\r\n",
      "a smutch on her scanty skirt, had held her so long that as soon as she\r\n",
      "raised her eyes they rested on a high fair drapery by which smutches\r\n",
      "were put to shame and which had glided toward her over the grass without\r\n",
      "her noting its rustle. She followed up its stiff sheen--up and up from\r\n",
      "the ground, where it had stopped--till at the end of a considerable\r\n",
      "journey her impression felt the shock of the fixed face which,\r\n",
      "surmounting it, seemed to offer the climax of the dressed condition.\r\n",
      "\"Why mamma!\" she cried the next instant--cried in a tone that, as\r\n",
      "she sprang to her feet, brought Sir Claude to his own beside her and\r\n",
      "gave her ladyship, a few yards off, the advantage of their momentary\r\n",
      "confusion. Poor Maisie's was immense; her mother's drop had the effect\r\n",
      "of one of the iron shutters that, in evening walks with Susan Ash, she\r\n",
      "had seen suddenly, at the touch of a spring, rattle down over shining\r\n",
      "shop-fronts. The light of foreign travel was darkened at a stroke; she\r\n",
      "had a horrible sense that they were caught; and for the first time of\r\n",
      "her life in Ida's presence she so far translated an impulse into an\r\n",
      "invidious act as to clutch straight at the hand of her responsible\r\n",
      "confederate. It didn't help her that he appeared at first equally hushed\r\n",
      "with horror; a minute during which, in the empty garden, with its long\r\n",
      "shadows on the lawn, its blue sea over the hedge and its startled peace\r\n",
      "in the air, both her elders remained as stiff as tall tumblers filled to\r\n",
      "the brim and held straight for fear of a spill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last, in a tone that enriched the whole surprise by its unexpected\r\n",
      "softness, her mother said to Sir Claude: \"Do you mind at all my speaking\r\n",
      "to her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no; DO you?\" His reply was so long in coming that Maisie was the\r\n",
      "first to find the right note.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed as he seemed to take it from her, and she felt a sufficient\r\n",
      "concession in his manner of addressing their visitor. \"How in the world\r\n",
      "did you know we were here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His wife, at this, came the rest of the way and sat down on the bench\r\n",
      "with a hand laid on her daughter, whom she gracefully drew to her and in\r\n",
      "whom, at her touch, the fear just kindled gave a second jump, but now in\r\n",
      "quite another direction. Sir Claude, on the further side, resumed his\r\n",
      "seat and his newspapers, so that the three grouped themselves like a\r\n",
      "family party; his connexion, in the oddest way in the world, almost\r\n",
      "cynically and in a flash acknowledged, and the mother patting the child\r\n",
      "into conformities unspeakable. Maisie could already feel how little it\r\n",
      "was Sir Claude and she who were caught. She had the positive sense of\r\n",
      "their catching their relative, catching her in the act of getting rid of\r\n",
      "her burden with a finality that showed her as unprecedentedly relaxed.\r\n",
      "Oh yes, the fear had dropped, and she had never been so irrevocably\r\n",
      "parted with as in the pressure of possession now supremely exerted\r\n",
      "by Ida's long-gloved and much-bangled arm. \"I went to the Regent's\r\n",
      "Park\"--this was presently her ladyship's answer to Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean to-day?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This morning, just after your own call there. That's how I found you\r\n",
      "out; that's what has brought me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude considered and Maisie waited. \"Whom then did you see?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ida gave a sound of indulgent mockery. \"I like your scare. I know your\r\n",
      "game. I didn't see the person I risked seeing, but I had been ready\r\n",
      "to take my chance of her.\" She addressed herself to Maisie; she had\r\n",
      "encircled her more closely. \"I asked for YOU, my dear, but I saw no one\r\n",
      "but a dirty parlourmaid. She was red in the face with the great things\r\n",
      "that, as she told me, had just happened in the absence of her mistress;\r\n",
      "and she luckily had the sense to have made out the place to which Sir\r\n",
      "Claude had come to take you. If he hadn't given a false scent I should\r\n",
      "find you here: that was the supposition on which I've proceeded.\" Ida\r\n",
      "had never been so explicit about proceeding or supposing, and Maisie,\r\n",
      "drinking this in, noted too how Sir Claude shared her fine impression of\r\n",
      "it. \"I wanted to see you,\" his wife continued, \"and now you can judge of\r\n",
      "the trouble I've taken. I had everything to do in town to-day, but I\r\n",
      "managed to get off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie and her companion, for a moment, did justice to this achievement;\r\n",
      "but Maisie was the first to express it. \"I'm glad you wanted to see me,\r\n",
      "mamma.\" Then after a concentration more deep and with a plunge more\r\n",
      "brave: \"A little more and you'd have been too late.\" It stuck in her\r\n",
      "throat, but she brought it out: \"We're going to France.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ida was magnificent; Ida kissed her on the forehead. \"That's just what I\r\n",
      "thought likely; it made me decide to run down. I fancied that in spite\r\n",
      "of your scramble you'd wait to cross, and it added to the reason I have\r\n",
      "for seeing you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie wondered intensely what the reason could be, but she knew ever so\r\n",
      "much better than to ask. She was slightly surprised indeed to perceive\r\n",
      "that Sir Claude didn't, and to hear him immediately enquire: \"What in\r\n",
      "the name of goodness can you have to say to her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His tone was not exactly rude, but it was impatient enough to make his\r\n",
      "wife's response a fresh specimen of the new softness. \"That, my dear\r\n",
      "man, is all my own business.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean,\" Sir Claude asked, \"that you wish me to leave you with\r\n",
      "her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, if you'll be so good; that's the extraordinary request I take the\r\n",
      "liberty of making.\" Her ladyship had dropped to a mildness of irony by\r\n",
      "which, for a moment, poor Maisie was mystified and charmed, puzzled\r\n",
      "with a glimpse of something that in all the years had at intervals\r\n",
      "peeped out. Ida smiled at Sir Claude with the strange air she had on\r\n",
      "such occasions of defying an interlocutor to keep it up as long; her\r\n",
      "huge eyes, her red lips, the intense marks in her face formed an\r\n",
      "_eclairage_ as distinct and public as a lamp set in a window. The\r\n",
      "child seemed quite to see in it the very beacon that had lighted her\r\n",
      "path; she suddenly found herself reflecting that it was no wonder the\r\n",
      "gentlemen were guided. This must have been the way mamma had first\r\n",
      "looked at Sir Claude; it brought back the lustre of the time they had\r\n",
      "outlived. It must have been the way she looked also at Mr. Perriam and\r\n",
      "Lord Eric; above all it contributed in Maisie's mind to a completer\r\n",
      "view of that satisfied state of the Captain. Our young lady grasped\r\n",
      "this idea with a quick lifting of the heart; there was a stillness\r\n",
      "during which her mother flooded her with a wealth of support to the\r\n",
      "Captain's striking tribute. This stillness remained long enough\r\n",
      "unbroken to represent that Sir Claude too might but be gasping again\r\n",
      "under the spell originally strong for him; so that Maisie quite hoped\r\n",
      "he would at least say something to show a recognition of how charming\r\n",
      "she could be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What he presently said was: \"Are you putting up for the night?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His wife cast grandly about. \"Not here--I've come from Dover.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Over Maisie's head, at this, they still faced each other. \"You spend the\r\n",
      "night there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I brought some things. I went to the hotel and hastily arranged;\r\n",
      "then I caught the train that whisked me on here. You see what a day I've\r\n",
      "had of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The statement may surprise, but these were really as obliging if not as\r\n",
      "lucid words as, into her daughter's ears at least, Ida's lips had ever\r\n",
      "dropped; and there was a quick desire in the daughter that for the hour\r\n",
      "at any rate they should duly be welcomed as a ground of intercourse.\r\n",
      "Certainly mamma had a charm which, when turned on, became a large\r\n",
      "explanation; and the only danger now in an impulse to applaud it would\r\n",
      "be that of appearing to signalise its rarity. Maisie, however, risked\r\n",
      "the peril in the geniality of an admission that Ida had indeed had a\r\n",
      "rush; and she invited Sir Claude to expose himself by agreeing with her\r\n",
      "that the rush had been even worse than theirs. He appeared to meet this\r\n",
      "appeal by saying with detachment enough: \"You go back there to-night?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes--there are plenty of trains.\" Again Sir Claude hesitated; it\r\n",
      "would have been hard to say if the child, between them, more connected\r\n",
      "or divided them. Then he brought out quietly: \"It will be late for you\r\n",
      "to knock about. I'll see you over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You needn't trouble, thank you. I think you won't deny that I can help\r\n",
      "myself and that it isn't the first time in my dreadful life that I've\r\n",
      "somehow managed it.\" Save for this allusion to her dreadful life they\r\n",
      "talked there, Maisie noted, as if they were only rather superficial\r\n",
      "friends; a special effect that she had often wondered at before in the\r\n",
      "midst of what she supposed to be intimacies. This effect was augmented\r\n",
      "by the almost casual manner in which her ladyship went on: \"I dare say\r\n",
      "I shall go abroad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From Dover do you mean, straight?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How straight I can't say. I'm excessively ill.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This for a minute struck Maisie as but a part of the conversation;\r\n",
      "at the end of which time she became aware that it ought to strike\r\n",
      "her--though it apparently didn't strike Sir Claude--as a part of\r\n",
      "something graver. It helped her to twist nearer. \"Ill, mamma--really\r\n",
      "ill?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She regretted her \"really\" as soon as she had spoken it; but there\r\n",
      "couldn't be a better proof of her mother's present polish than that Ida\r\n",
      "showed no gleam of a temper to take it up. She had taken up at other\r\n",
      "times much tinier things. She only pressed Maisie's head against her\r\n",
      "bosom and said: \"Shockingly, my dear. I must go to that new place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What new place?\" Sir Claude enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ida thought, but couldn't recall it. \"Oh 'Chose,' don't you know?\r\n",
      "--where every one goes. I want some proper treatment. It's all I've ever\r\n",
      "asked for on earth. But that's not what I came to say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, in silence, folded one by one his newspapers; then he rose\r\n",
      "and stood whacking the palm of his hand with the bundle. \"You'll stop\r\n",
      "and dine with us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear no--I can't dine at this sort of hour. I ordered dinner at Dover.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her ladyship's tone in this one instance showed a certain superiority to\r\n",
      "those conditions in which her daughter had artlessly found Folkestone a\r\n",
      "paradise. It was yet not so crushing as to nip in the bud the eagerness\r\n",
      "with which the latter broke out: \"But won't you at least have a cup of\r\n",
      "tea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ida kissed her again on the brow. \"Thanks, love. I had tea before\r\n",
      "coming.\" She raised her eyes to Sir Claude. \"She IS sweet!\" He made no\r\n",
      "more answer than if he didn't agree; but Maisie was at ease about that\r\n",
      "and was still taken up with the joy of this happier pitch of their talk,\r\n",
      "which put more and more of a meaning into the Captain's version of her\r\n",
      "ladyship and literally kindled a conjecture that such an admirer might,\r\n",
      "over there at the other place, be waiting for her to dine. Was the same\r\n",
      "conjecture in Sir Claude's mind? He partly puzzled her, if it had risen\r\n",
      "there, by the slight perversity with which he returned to a question\r\n",
      "that his wife evidently thought she had disposed of.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He whacked his hand again with his paper. \"I had really much better take\r\n",
      "you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And leave Maisie here alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mamma so clearly didn't want it that Maisie leaped at the vision of a\r\n",
      "Captain who had seen her on from Dover and who, while he waited to take\r\n",
      "her back, would be hovering just at the same distance at which, in\r\n",
      "Kensington Gardens, the companion of his walk had herself hovered. Of\r\n",
      "course, however, instead of breathing any such guess she let Sir Claude\r\n",
      "reply; all the more that his reply could contribute so much to her own\r\n",
      "present grandeur. \"She won't be alone when she has a maid in\r\n",
      "attendance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had never before had so much of a retinue, and she waited also to\r\n",
      "enjoy the action of it on her ladyship. \"You mean the woman you brought\r\n",
      "from town?\" Ida considered. \"The person at the house spoke of her in a\r\n",
      "way that scarcely made her out company for my child.\" Her tone was that\r\n",
      "her child had never wanted, in her hands, for prodigious company. But\r\n",
      "she as distinctly continued to decline Sir Claude's. \"Don't be an old\r\n",
      "goose,\" she said charmingly. \"Let us alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In front of them on the grass he looked graver than Maisie at all now\r\n",
      "thought the occasion warranted. \"I don't see why you can't say it before\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His wife smoothed one of her daughter's curls. \"Say what, dear?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why what you came to say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this Maisie at last interposed: she appealed to Sir Claude. \"Do let\r\n",
      "her say it to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked hard for a moment at his little friend. \"How do you know what\r\n",
      "she may say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She must risk it,\" Ida remarked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I only want to protect you,\" he continued to the child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You want to protect yourself--that's what you mean,\" his wife replied.\r\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid. I won't touch you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She won't touch you--she WON'T!\" Maisie declared. She felt by this time\r\n",
      "that she could really answer for it, and something of the emotion with\r\n",
      "which she had listened to the Captain came back to her. It made her\r\n",
      "so happy and so secure that she could positively patronise mamma. She\r\n",
      "did so in the Captain's very language. \"She's good, she's good!\" she\r\n",
      "proclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Lord!\"--Sir Claude, at this, let himself go. He appeared to have\r\n",
      "emitted some sound of derision that was smothered, to Maisie's ears, by\r\n",
      "her being again embraced by his wife. Ida released her and held her off\r\n",
      "a little, looking at her with a very queer face. Then the child became\r\n",
      "aware that their companion had left them and that from the face in\r\n",
      "question a confirmatory remark had proceeded.\r\n",

      "A good deal of the rest of Ida's visit was devoted to explaining, as it\r\n",
      "were, so extraordinary a statement. This explanation was more copious\r\n",
      "than any she had yet indulged in, and as the summer twilight gathered\r\n",
      "and she kept her child in the garden she was conciliatory to a degree\r\n",
      "that let her need to arrange things a little perceptibly peep out. It\r\n",
      "was not merely that she explained; she almost conversed; all that was\r\n",
      "wanting was that she should have positively chattered a little less. It\r\n",
      "was really the occasion of Maisie's life on which her mother was to have\r\n",
      "most to say to her. That alone was an implication of generosity and\r\n",
      "virtue, and no great stretch was required to make our young lady feel\r\n",
      "that she should best meet her and soonest have it over by simply seeming\r\n",
      "struck with the propriety of her contention. They sat together while\r\n",
      "the parent's gloved hand sometimes rested sociably on the child's and\r\n",
      "sometimes gave a corrective pull to a ribbon too meagre or a tress too\r\n",
      "thick; and Maisie was conscious of the effort to keep out of her eyes\r\n",
      "the wonder with which they were occasionally moved to blink. Oh there\r\n",
      "would have been things to blink at if one had let one's self go; and\r\n",
      "it was lucky they were alone together, without Sir Claude or Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "or even Mrs. Beale to catch an imprudent glance. Though profuse and\r\n",
      "prolonged her ladyship was not exhaustively lucid, and her account of\r\n",
      "her situation, so far as it could be called descriptive, was a muddle\r\n",
      "of inconsequent things, bruised fruit of an occasion she had rather too\r\n",
      "lightly affronted. None of them were really thought out and some were\r\n",
      "even not wholly insincere. It was as if she had asked outright what\r\n",
      "better proof could have been wanted of her goodness and her greatness\r\n",
      "than just this marvellous consent to give up what she had so cherished.\r\n",
      "It was as if she had said in so many words: \"There have been things\r\n",
      "between us--between Sir Claude and me--which I needn't go into, you\r\n",
      "little nuisance, because you wouldn't understand them.\" It suited her\r\n",
      "to convey that Maisie had been kept, so far as SHE was concerned or\r\n",
      "could imagine, in a holy ignorance and that she must take for granted a\r\n",
      "supreme simplicity. She turned this way and that in the predicament she\r\n",
      "had sought and from which she could neither retreat with grace nor\r\n",
      "emerge with credit: she draped herself in the tatters of her impudence,\r\n",
      "postured to her utmost before the last little triangle of cracked glass\r\n",
      "to which so many fractures had reduced the polished plate of filial\r\n",
      "superstition. If neither Sir Claude nor Mrs. Wix was there this was\r\n",
      "perhaps all the more a pity: the scene had a style of its own that would\r\n",
      "have qualified it for presentation, especially at such a moment as that\r\n",
      "of her letting it betray that she quite did think her wretched offspring\r\n",
      "better placed with Sir Claude than in her own soiled hands. There was at\r\n",
      "any rate nothing scant either in her admissions or her perversions, the\r\n",
      "mixture of her fear of what Maisie might undiscoverably think and of the\r\n",
      "support she at the same time gathered from a necessity of selfishness\r\n",
      "and a habit of brutality. This habit flushed through the merit she now\r\n",
      "made, in terms explicit, of not having come to Folkestone to kick up a\r\n",
      "vulgar row. She had not come to box any ears or to bang any doors or\r\n",
      "even to use any language: she had come at the worst to lose the thread\r\n",
      "of her argument in an occasional dumb disgusted twitch of the toggery in\r\n",
      "which Mrs. Beale's low domestic had had the impudence to serve up Miss\r\n",
      "Farange. She checked all criticism, not committing herself even so far\r\n",
      "as for those missing comforts of the schoolroom on which Mrs. Wix had\r\n",
      "presumed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I AM good--I'm crazily, I'm criminally good. But it won't do for YOU\r\n",
      "any more, and if I've ceased to contend with him, and with you too, who\r\n",
      "have made most of the trouble between us, it's for reasons that you'll\r\n",
      "understand one of these days but too well--one of these days when I\r\n",
      "hope you'll know what it is to have lost a mother. I'm awfully ill, but\r\n",
      "you mustn't ask me anything about it. If I don't get off somewhere my\r\n",
      "doctor won't answer for the consequences. He's stupefied at what I've\r\n",
      "borne--he says it has been put on me because I was formed to suffer. I'm\r\n",
      "thinking of South Africa, but that's none of your business. You must\r\n",
      "take your choice--you can't ask me questions if you're so ready to\r\n",
      "give me up. No, I won't tell you; you can find out for yourself. South\r\n",
      "Africa's wonderful, they say, and if I do go it must be to give it a\r\n",
      "fair trial. It must be either one thing or the other; if he takes you,\r\n",
      "you know, he takes you. I've struck my last blow for you; I can follow\r\n",
      "you no longer from pillar to post. I must live for myself at last, while\r\n",
      "there's still a handful left of me. I'm very, very ill; I'm very, very\r\n",
      "tired; I'm very, very determined. There you have it. Make the most of\r\n",
      "it. Your frock's too filthy; but I came to sacrifice myself.\" Maisie\r\n",
      "looked at the peccant places; there were moments when it was a relief to\r\n",
      "her to drop her eyes even on anything so sordid. All her interviews, all\r\n",
      "her ordeals with her mother had, as she had grown older, seemed to have,\r\n",
      "before any other, the hard quality of duration; but longer than any,\r\n",
      "strangely, were these minutes offered to her as so pacific and so\r\n",
      "agreeably winding up the connexion. It was her anxiety that made them\r\n",
      "long, her fear of some hitch, some check of the current, one of her\r\n",
      "ladyship's famous quick jumps. She held her breath; she only wanted,\r\n",
      "by playing into her visitor's hands, to see the thing through. But her\r\n",
      "impatience itself made at instants the whole situation swim; there were\r\n",
      "things Ida said that she perhaps didn't hear, and there were things\r\n",
      "she heard that Ida perhaps didn't say. \"You're all I have, and yet I'm\r\n",
      "capable of this. Your father wishes you were dead--that, my dear, is\r\n",
      "what your father wishes. You'll have to get used to it as I've done--I\r\n",
      "mean to his wishing that I'M dead. At all events you see for yourself\r\n",
      "how wonderful I am to Sir Claude. He wishes me dead quite as much; and\r\n",
      "I'm sure that if making me scenes about YOU could have killed me--!\" It\r\n",
      "was the mark of Ida's eloquence that she started more hares than she\r\n",
      "followed, and she gave but a glance in the direction of this one; going\r\n",
      "on to say that the very proof of her treating her husband like an angel\r\n",
      "was that he had just stolen off not to be fairly shamed. She spoke as\r\n",
      "if he had retired on tiptoe, as he might have withdrawn from a place\r\n",
      "of worship in which he was not fit to be present. \"You'll never know\r\n",
      "what I've been through about you--never, never, never. I spare you\r\n",
      "everything, as I always have; though I dare say you know things that,\r\n",
      "if I did (I mean if I knew them) would make me--well, no matter! You're\r\n",
      "old enough at any rate to know there are a lot of things I don't say\r\n",
      "that I easily might; though it would do me good, I assure you, to have\r\n",
      "spoken my mind for once in my life. I don't speak of your father's\r\n",
      "infamous wife: that may give you a notion of the way I'm letting you\r\n",
      "off. When I say 'you' I mean your precious friends and backers. If you\r\n",
      "don't do justice to my forbearing, out of delicacy, to mention, just as\r\n",
      "a last word, about your stepfather, a little fact or two of a kind that\r\n",
      "really I should only HAVE to mention to shine myself in comparison, and\r\n",
      "after every calumny, like pure gold: if you don't do me THAT justice\r\n",
      "you'll never do me justice at all!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie's desire to show what justice she did her had by this time become\r\n",
      "so intense as to have brought with it an inspiration. The great effect\r\n",
      "of their encounter had been to confirm her sense of being launched with\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, to make it rich and full beyond anything she had dreamed,\r\n",
      "and everything now conspired to suggest that a single soft touch of her\r\n",
      "small hand would complete the good work and set her ladyship so promptly\r\n",
      "and majestically afloat as to leave the great seaway clear for the\r\n",
      "morrow. This was the more the case as her hand had for some moments been\r\n",
      "rendered free by a marked manoeuvre of both of her mother's. One of\r\n",
      "these capricious members had fumbled with visible impatience in some\r\n",
      "backward depth of drapery and had presently reappeared with a small\r\n",
      "article in its grasp. The act had a significance for a little person\r\n",
      "trained, in that relation, from an early age, to keep an eye on manual\r\n",
      "motions, and its possible bearing was not darkened by the memory of the\r\n",
      "handful of gold that Susan Ash would never, never believe Mrs. Beale had\r\n",
      "sent back--\"not she; she's too false and too greedy!\"--to the munificent\r\n",
      "Countess. To have guessed, none the less, that her ladyship's purse\r\n",
      "might be the real figure of the object extracted from the rustling\r\n",
      "covert at her rear--this suspicion gave on the spot to the child's eyes\r\n",
      "a direction carefully distant. It added moreover to the optimism that\r\n",
      "for an hour could ruffle the surface of her deep diplomacy, ruffle it\r\n",
      "to the point of making her forget that she had never been safe unless\r\n",
      "she had also been stupid. She in short forgot her habitual caution in\r\n",
      "her impulse to adopt her ladyship's practical interests and show her\r\n",
      "ladyship how perfectly she understood them. She saw without looking\r\n",
      "that her mother pressed a little clasp; heard, without wanting to,\r\n",
      "the sharp click that marked the closing portemonnaie from which\r\n",
      "something had been taken. What this was she just didn't see; it was not\r\n",
      "too substantial to be locked with ease in the fold of her ladyship's\r\n",
      "fingers. Nothing was less new to Maisie than the art of not thinking\r\n",
      "singly, so that at this instant she could both bring out what was on\r\n",
      "her tongue's end and weigh, as to the object in her mother's palm, the\r\n",
      "question of its being a sovereign against the question of its being a\r\n",
      "shilling. No sooner had she begun to speak than she saw that within a\r\n",
      "few seconds this question would have been settled: she had foolishly\r\n",
      "checked the rising words of the little speech of presentation to which,\r\n",
      "under the circumstances, even such a high pride as Ida's had had to give\r\n",
      "some thought. She had checked it completely--that was the next thing she\r\n",
      "felt: the note she sounded brought into her companion's eyes a look that\r\n",
      "quickly enough seemed at variance with presentations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That was what the Captain said to me that day, mamma. I think it would\r\n",
      "have given you pleasure to hear the way he spoke of you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pleasure, Maisie could now in consternation reflect, would have been\r\n",
      "a long time coming if it had come no faster than the response evoked by\r\n",
      "her allusion to it. Her mother gave her one of the looks that slammed\r\n",
      "the door in her face; never in a career of unsuccessful experiments had\r\n",
      "Maisie had to take such a stare. It reminded her of the way that once,\r\n",
      "at one of the lectures in Glower Street, something in a big jar that,\r\n",
      "amid an array of strange glasses and bad smells, had been promised as a\r\n",
      "beautiful yellow was produced as a beautiful black. She had been sorry\r\n",
      "on that occasion for the lecturer, but she was at this moment sorrier\r\n",
      "for herself. Oh nothing had ever made for twinges like mamma's manner of\r\n",
      "saying: \"The Captain? What Captain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why when we met you in the Gardens--the one who took me to sit with\r\n",
      "him. That was exactly what HE said.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ida let it come on so far as to appear for an instant to pick up a lost\r\n",
      "thread. \"What on earth did he say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie faltered supremely, but supremely she brought it out. \"What you\r\n",
      "say, mamma--that you're so good.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What 'I' say?\" Ida slowly rose, keeping her eyes on her child, and the\r\n",
      "hand that had busied itself in her purse conformed at her side and amid\r\n",
      "the folds of her dress to a certain stiffening of the arm. \"I say you're\r\n",
      "a precious idiot, and I won't have you put words into my mouth!\" This\r\n",
      "was much more peremptory than a mere contradiction. Maisie could only\r\n",
      "feel on the spot that everything had broken short off and that their\r\n",
      "communication had abruptly ceased. That was presently proved. \"What\r\n",
      "business have you to speak to me of him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her daughter turned scarlet. \"I thought you liked him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Him!--the biggest cad in London!\" Her ladyship towered again, and in\r\n",
      "the gathering dusk the whites of her eyes were huge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie's own, however, could by this time pretty well match them; and\r\n",
      "she had at least now, with the first flare of anger that had ever yet\r\n",
      "lighted her face for a foe, the sense of looking up quite as hard as any\r\n",
      "one could look down. \"Well, he was kind about you then; he WAS, and it\r\n",
      "made me like him. He said things--they were beautiful, they were, they\r\n",
      "were!\" She was almost capable of the violence of forcing this home, for\r\n",
      "even in the midst of her surge of passion--of which in fact it was a\r\n",
      "part--there rose in her a fear, a pain, a vision ominous, precocious,\r\n",
      "of what it might mean for her mother's fate to have forfeited such a\r\n",
      "loyalty as that. There was literally an instant in which Maisie fully\r\n",
      "saw--saw madness and desolation, saw ruin and darkness and death. \"I've\r\n",
      "thought of him often since, and I hoped it was with him--with him--\"\r\n",
      "Here, in her emotion, it failed her, the breath of her filial hope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Ida got it out of her. \"You hoped, you little horror--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That it was he who's at Dover, that it was he who's to take you. I mean\r\n",
      "to South Africa,\" Maisie said with another drop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ida's stupefaction, on this, kept her silent unnaturally long, so long\r\n",
      "that her daughter could not only wonder what was coming, but perfectly\r\n",
      "measure the decline of every symptom of her liberality. She loomed there\r\n",
      "in her grandeur, merely dark and dumb; her wrath was clearly still, as\r\n",
      "it had always been, a thing of resource and variety. What Maisie least\r\n",
      "expected of it was by this law what now occurred. It melted, in the\r\n",
      "summer twilight, gradually into pity, and the pity after a little found\r\n",
      "a cadence to which the renewed click of her purse gave an accent.\r\n",
      "She had put back what she had taken out. \"You're a dreadful dismal\r\n",
      "deplorable little thing,\" she murmured. And with this she turned back\r\n",
      "and rustled away over the lawn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After she had disappeared, Maisie dropped upon the bench again and for\r\n",
      "some time, in the empty garden and the deeper dusk, sat and stared at\r\n",
      "the image her flight had still left standing. It had ceased to be her\r\n",
      "mother only, in the strangest way, that it might become her father, the\r\n",
      "father of whose wish that she were dead the announcement still lingered\r\n",
      "in the air. It was a presence with vague edges--it continued to front\r\n",
      "her, to cover her. But what reality that she need reckon with did it\r\n",
      "represent if Mr. Farange were, on his side, also going off--going off to\r\n",
      "America with the Countess, or even only to Spa? That question had, from\r\n",
      "the house, a sudden gay answer in the great roar of a gong, and at the\r\n",
      "same moment she saw Sir Claude look out for her from the wide lighted\r\n",
      "doorway. At this she went to him and he came forward and met her on the\r\n",
      "lawn. For a minute she was with him there in silence as, just before, at\r\n",
      "the last, she had been with her mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's gone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's gone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing more, for the instant, passed between them but to move together\r\n",
      "to the house, where, in the hall, he indulged in one of those sudden\r\n",
      "pleasantries with which, to the delight of his stepdaughter, his native\r\n",
      "animation overflowed. \"Will Miss Farange do me the honour to accept my\r\n",
      "arm?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nothing in all her days that Miss Farange had accepted with\r\n",
      "such bliss, a bright rich element that floated them together to their\r\n",
      "feast; before they reached which, however, she uttered, in the spirit\r\n",
      "of a glad young lady taken in to her first dinner, a sociable word that\r\n",
      "made him stop short. \"She goes to South Africa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To South Africa?\" His face, for a moment, seemed to swing for a jump;\r\n",
      "the next it took its spring into the extreme of hilarity. \"Is that what\r\n",
      "she said?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I didn't MISTAKE!\" Maisie took to herself THAT credit. \"For the\r\n",
      "climate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude was now looking at a young woman with black hair, a red frock\r\n",
      "and a tiny terrier tucked under her elbow. She swept past them on her\r\n",
      "way to the dining-room, leaving an impression of a strong scent which\r\n",
      "mingled, amid the clatter of the place, with the hot aroma of food. He\r\n",
      "had become a little graver; he still stopped to talk. \"I see--I see.\"\r\n",
      "Other people brushed by; he was not too grave to notice them. \"Did she\r\n",
      "say anything else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, a lot more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this he met her eyes again with some intensity, but only repeating:\r\n",
      "\"I see--I see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had still her own vision, which she brought out. \"I thought she\r\n",
      "was going to give me something.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What kind of a thing?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Some money that she took out of her purse and then put back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude's amusement reappeared. \"She thought better of it. Dear\r\n",
      "thrifty soul! How much did she make by that manoeuvre?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie considered. \"I didn't see. It was very small.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude threw back his head. \"Do you mean very little? Sixpence?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie resented this almost as if, at dinner, she were already bandying\r\n",
      "jokes with an agreeable neighbour. \"It may have been a sovereign.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Or even,\" Sir Claude suggested, \"a ten-pound note.\" She flushed at this\r\n",
      "sudden picture of what she perhaps had lost, and he made it more vivid\r\n",
      "by adding: \"Rolled up in a tight little ball, you know--her way of\r\n",
      "treating banknotes as if they were curl-papers!\" Maisie's flush deepened\r\n",
      "both with the immense plausibility of this and with a fresh wave of the\r\n",
      "consciousness that was always there to remind her of his cleverness--the\r\n",
      "consciousness of how immeasurably more after all he knew about mamma\r\n",
      "than she. She had lived with her so many times without discovering the\r\n",
      "material of her curl-papers or assisting at any other of her dealings\r\n",
      "with banknotes. The tight little ball had at any rate rolled away from\r\n",
      "her for ever--quite like one of the other balls that Ida's cue used to\r\n",
      "send flying. Sir Claude gave her his arm again, and by the time she was\r\n",
      "seated at table she had perfectly made up her mind as to the amount of\r\n",
      "the sum she had forfeited. Everything about her, however--the crowded\r\n",
      "room, the bedizened banquet, the savour of dishes, the drama of\r\n",
      "figures--ministered to the joy of life. After dinner she smoked with her\r\n",
      "friend--for that was exactly what she felt she did--on a porch, a kind\r\n",
      "of terrace, where the red tips of cigars and the light dresses of ladies\r\n",
      "made, under the happy stars, a poetry that was almost intoxicating.\r\n",
      "They talked but little, and she was slightly surprised at his asking\r\n",
      "for no more news of what her mother had said; but she had no need of\r\n",
      "talk--there were a sense and a sound in everything to which words had\r\n",
      "nothing to add. They smoked and smoked, and there was a sweetness in her\r\n",
      "stepfather's silence. At last he said: \"Let us take another turn--but\r\n",
      "you must go to bed soon. Oh you know, we're going to have a system!\"\r\n",
      "Their turn was back into the garden, along the dusky paths from which\r\n",
      "they could see the black masts and the red lights of boats and hear the\r\n",
      "calls and cries that evidently had to do with happy foreign travel; and\r\n",
      "their system was once more to get on beautifully in this further lounge\r\n",
      "without a definite exchange. Yet he finally spoke--he broke out as he\r\n",
      "tossed away the match from which he had taken a fresh light: \"I must go\r\n",
      "for a stroll. I'm in a fidget--I must walk it off.\" She fell in with\r\n",
      "this as she fell in with everything; on which he went on: \"You go up to\r\n",
      "Miss Ash\"--it was the name they had started; \"you must see she's not in\r\n",
      "mischief. Can you find your way alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes; I've been up and down seven times.\" She positively enjoyed the\r\n",
      "prospect of an eighth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still they didn't separate; they stood smoking together under the stars.\r\n",
      "Then at last Sir Claude produced it. \"I'm free--I'm free.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked up at him; it was the very spot on which a couple of hours\r\n",
      "before she had looked up at her mother. \"You're free--you're free.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To-morrow we go to France.\" He spoke as if he hadn't heard her; but it\r\n",
      "didn't prevent her again concurring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To-morrow we go to France.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again he appeared not to have heard her; and after a moment--it was an\r\n",
      "effect evidently of the depth of his reflexions and the agitation of\r\n",
      "his soul--he also spoke as if he had not spoken before. \"I'm free--I'm\r\n",
      "free!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She repeated her form of assent. \"You're free--you're free.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time he did hear her; he fixed her through the darkness with a\r\n",
      "grave face. But he said nothing more; he simply stooped a little and\r\n",
      "drew her to him--simply held her a little and kissed her goodnight;\r\n",
      "after which, having given her a silent push upstairs to Miss Ash, he\r\n",

      "the height at which Sir Claude remained and which had never in every way\r\n",

      "above all in the great ecstasy of a larger impression of life. She was\r\n",

      "reached the hotel recognised in the institutions and manners of France a\r\n",
      "multitude of affinities and messages. Literally in the course of an hour\r\n",
      "she found her initiation; a consciousness much quickened by the superior\r\n",
      "part that, as soon as they had gobbled down a French breakfast--which\r\n",
      "was indeed a high note in the concert--she observed herself to play to\r\n",
      "Susan Ash. Sir Claude, who had already bumped against people he knew and\r\n",
      "who, as he said, had business and letters, sent them out together for a\r\n",

      "required, not only for the loud giggles that in their London trudges\r\n",
      "used to break from her attendant, but for all the years of her tendency\r\n",
      "to produce socially that impression of an excess of the queer something\r\n",
      "which had seemed to waver so widely between innocence and guilt. On the\r\n",
      "spot, at Boulogne, though there might have been excess there was at\r\n",
      "least no wavering; she recognised, she understood, she adored and took\r\n",
      "possession; feeling herself attuned to everything and laying her hand,\r\n",
      "right and left, on what had simply been waiting for her. She explained\r\n",

      "somehow Susan's stupidity, of which she had never yet been so sure,\r\n",

      "went down to the wide sands, shimmered, in a thousand tints, with the\r\n",
      "pretty organisation of the _plage_, with the gaiety of spectators and\r\n",
      "bathers, with that of the language and the weather, and above all with\r\n",
      "that of our young lady's unprecedented situation. For it appeared to her\r\n",
      "that no one since the beginning of time could have had such an adventure\r\n",
      "or, in an hour, so much experience; as a sequel to which she only\r\n",
      "needed, in order to feel with conscious wonder how the past was changed,\r\n",
      "to hear Susan, inscrutably aggravated, express a preference for the\r\n",
      "Edgware Road. The past was so changed and the circle it had formed\r\n",
      "already so overstepped that on that very afternoon, in the course of\r\n",
      "another walk, she found herself enquiring of Sir Claude--without a\r\n",
      "single scruple--if he were prepared as yet to name the moment at which\r\n",

      "be so much older since yesterday without reflecting that if by this time\r\n",
      "she probed a little he would recognise that she had done enough for mere\r\n",
      "patience. There was in fact something in his eyes that suddenly, to her\r\n",
      "own, made her discretion shabby. Before she could remedy this he had\r\n",
      "answered her last question, answered it in the way that, of all ways,\r\n",
      "she had least expected. \"The thing it doesn't do not to do? Certainly\r\n",

      "it's so beastly expensive.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "poor then, that is was HE poor, really poor beyond the pleasantry of\r\n",
      "apollinaris and cold beef? They had walked to the end of the long jetty\r\n",
      "that enclosed the harbour and were looking out at the dangers they had\r\n",
      "escaped, the grey horizon that was England, the tumbled surface of the\r\n",
      "sea and the brown smacks that bobbed upon it. Why had he chosen an\r\n",
      "embarrassed time to make this foreign dash? unless indeed it was just\r\n",
      "the dash economic, of which she had often heard and on which, after\r\n",
      "another look at the grey horizon and the bobbing boats, she was ready\r\n",
      "to turn round with elation. She replied to him quite in his own manner:\r\n",
      "\"I see, I see.\" She smiled up at him. \"Our affairs are involved.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it.\" He returned her smile. \"Mine are not quite so bad as yours;\r\n",
      "for yours are really, my dear man, in a state I can't see through at\r\n",
      "all. But mine will do--for a mess.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought this over. \"But isn't France cheaper than England?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "England, over there in the thickening gloom, looked just then remarkably\r\n",
      "dear. \"I dare say; some parts.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was something that for an instant, in satisfaction of this, he had\r\n",
      "the air of being about to say and yet not saying. What he presently said\r\n",
      "was: \"This very place is one of them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then we shall live here?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It took her breath away. \"You can save money in that time?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He burst out laughing, starting to walk again and taking her under his\r\n",
      "arm. He confessed to her on the way that she too had put a finger on\r\n",
      "the weakest of all his weaknesses, the fact, of which he was perfectly\r\n",
      "aware, that he probably might have lived within his means if he had\r\n",
      "never done anything for thrift. \"It's the happy thoughts that do it,\" he\r\n",
      "said; \"there's nothing so ruinous as putting in a cheap week.\" Maisie\r\n",
      "heard afresh among the pleasant sounds of the closing day that steel\r\n",
      "click of Ida's change of mind. She thought of the ten-pound note\r\n",
      "it would have been delightful at this juncture to produce for her\r\n",
      "companion's encouragement. But the idea was dissipated by his saying\r\n",
      "irrelevantly, in presence of the next thing they stopped to admire: \"We\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She turned upon him. \"Mrs. Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Wix. I've had a wire,\" he went on. \"She has seen your mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Seen mamma?\" Maisie stared. \"Where in the world?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Apparently in London. They've been together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For an instant this looked ominous--a fear came into her eyes. \"Then\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Your mother?--to South Africa? I give it up, dear boy,\" Sir Claude\r\n",

      "there and with a kind of absent gaze--absent, that is, from HER\r\n",
      "affairs--followed the fine stride and shining limbs of a young fishwife\r\n",
      "who had just waded out of the sea with her basketful of shrimps. His\r\n",
      "thought came back to her sooner than his eyes. \"But I dare say it's all\r\n",
      "right. She wouldn't come if it wasn't, poor old thing: she knows rather\r\n",
      "well what she's about.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was so reassuring that Maisie, after turning it over, could make it\r\n",
      "fit into her dream. \"Well, what IS she about?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He finally stopped looking at the fishwife--he met his companion's\r\n",
      "enquiry. \"Oh you know!\" There was something in the way he said it that\r\n",
      "made, between them, more of an equality than she had yet imagined; but\r\n",
      "it had also more the effect of raising her up than of letting him down,\r\n",
      "and what it did with her was shown by the sound of her assent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--I know!\" What she knew, what she COULD know is by this time no\r\n",
      "secret to us: it grew and grew at any rate, the rest of that day, in the\r\n",
      "air of what he took for granted. It was better he should do that than\r\n",
      "attempt to test her knowledge; but there at the worst was the gist of\r\n",
      "the matter: it was open between them at last that their great change,\r\n",
      "as, speaking as if it had already lasted weeks, Maisie called it, was\r\n",
      "somehow built up round Mrs. Wix. Before she went to bed that night she\r\n",
      "knew further that Sir Claude, since, as HE called it, they had been on\r\n",
      "the rush, had received more telegrams than one. But they separated again\r\n",
      "without speaking of Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh what a crossing for the straighteners and the old brown dress--which\r\n",
      "latter appurtenance the child saw thriftily revived for the possible\r\n",
      "disasters of travel! The wind got up in the night and from her little\r\n",
      "room at the inn Maisie could hear the noise of the sea. The next day it\r\n",
      "was raining and everything different: this was the case even with Susan\r\n",
      "Ash, who positively crowed over the bad weather, partly, it seemed, for\r\n",
      "relish of the time their visitor would have in the boat, and partly to\r\n",
      "point the moral of the folly of coming to such holes. In the wet, with\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, Maisie went to the Folkestone packet, on the arrival of\r\n",
      "which, with many signs of the fray, he made her wait under an umbrella\r\n",
      "by the quay; whence almost ere the vessel touched, he was to be\r\n",
      "descried, in quest of their friend, wriggling--that had been his\r\n",
      "word--through the invalids massed upon the deck. It was long till\r\n",
      "he reappeared--it was not indeed till every one had landed; when he\r\n",
      "presented the object of his benevolence in a light that Maisie scarce\r\n",
      "knew whether to suppose the depth of prostration or the flush of\r\n",
      "triumph. The lady on his arm, still bent beneath her late ordeal, was\r\n",
      "muffled in such draperies as had never before offered so much support\r\n",
      "to so much woe. At the hotel, an hour later, this ambiguity dropped:\r\n",
      "assisting Mrs. Wix in private to refresh and reinvest herself, Maisie\r\n",
      "heard from her in detail how little she could have achieved if Sir\r\n",
      "Claude hadn't put it in her power. It was a phrase that in her room she\r\n",
      "repeated in connexions indescribable: he had put it in her power to have\r\n",
      "\"changes,\" as she said, of the most intimate order, adapted to climates\r\n",
      "and occasions so various as to foreshadow in themselves the stages of\r\n",
      "a vast itinerary. Cheap weeks would of course be in their place after\r\n",
      "so much money spent on a governess; sums not grudged, however, by this\r\n",
      "lady's pupil, even on her feeling her own appearance give rise, through\r\n",
      "the straighteners, to an attention perceptibly mystified. Sir Claude in\r\n",
      "truth had had less time to devote to it than to Mrs. Wix's; and moreover\r\n",
      "she would rather be in her own shoes than in her friend's creaking new\r\n",
      "ones in the event of an encounter with Mrs. Beale. Maisie was too lost\r\n",
      "in the idea of Mrs. Beale's judgement of so much newness to pass any\r\n",
      "judgement herself. Besides, after much luncheon and many endearments,\r\n",
      "the question took quite another turn, to say nothing of the pleasure\r\n",
      "of the child's quick view that there were other eyes than Susan Ash's\r\n",
      "to open to what she could show. She couldn't show much, alas, till it\r\n",
      "stopped raining, which it declined to do that day; but this had only the\r\n",
      "effect of leaving more time for Mrs. Wix's own demonstration. It came\r\n",
      "as they sat in the little white and gold salon which Maisie thought the\r\n",
      "loveliest place she had ever seen except perhaps the apartment of the\r\n",
      "Countess; it came while the hard summer storm lashed the windows and\r\n",
      "blew in such a chill that Sir Claude, with his hands in his pockets and\r\n",
      "cigarettes in his teeth, fidgeting, frowning, looking out and turning\r\n",
      "back, ended by causing a smoky little fire to be made in the dressy\r\n",
      "little chimney. It came in spite of something that could only be named\r\n",
      "his air of wishing to put it off; an air that had served him--oh as all\r\n",
      "his airs served him!--to the extent of his having for a couple of hours\r\n",
      "confined the conversation to gratuitous jokes and generalities, kept it\r\n",
      "on the level of the little empty coffee-cups and _petits verres_ (Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix had two of each!) that struck Maisie, through the fumes of the\r\n",
      "French fire and the English tobacco, as a token more than ever that they\r\n",
      "were launched. She felt now, in close quarters and as clearly as if Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix had told her, that what this lady had come over for was not merely\r\n",
      "to be chaffed and to hear her pupil chaffed; not even to hear Sir\r\n",
      "Claude, who knew French in perfection, imitate the strange sounds\r\n",
      "emitted by the English folk at the hotel. It was perhaps half an effect\r\n",
      "of her present renovations, as if her clothes had been somebody's else:\r\n",
      "she had at any rate never produced such an impression of high colour,\r\n",
      "of a redness associated in Maisie's mind at THAT pitch either with\r\n",
      "measles or with \"habits.\" Her heart was not at all in the gossip about\r\n",
      "Boulogne; and if her complexion was partly the result of the dejeuner\r\n",
      "and the _petits verres_ it was also the brave signal of what she was\r\n",
      "there to say. Maisie knew when this did come how anxiously it had been\r\n",
      "awaited by the youngest member of the party. \"Her ladyship packed me\r\n",
      "off--she almost put me into the cab!\" That was what Mrs. Wix at last\r\n",

      "you mean you went to see her yesterday?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She came to see ME. She knocked at my shabby door. She mounted my\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Maisie wondered. \"She went back that evening?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; yesterday morning. She drove to me straight from the station. It\r\n",
      "was most remarkable. If I had a job to get off she did nothing to make\r\n",
      "it worse--she did a great deal to make it better.\" Mrs. Wix hung fire,\r\n",
      "though the flame in her face burned brighter; then she became capable\r\n",
      "of saying: \"Her ladyship's kind! She did what I didn't expect.\"\r\n",

      "Maisie, on this, looked straight at her stepfather's back; it might well\r\n",
      "have been for her at that hour a monument of her ladyship's kindness. It\r\n",
      "remained, as such, monumentally still, and for a time that permitted the\r\n",
      "child to ask of their companion: \"Did she really help you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Most practically.\" Again Mrs. Wix paused; again she quite resounded.\r\n",
      "\"She gave me a ten-pound note.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that, still looking out, Sir Claude, at the window, laughed loud. \"So\r\n",
      "you see, Maisie, we've not quite lost it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no,\" Maisie responded. \"Isn't that too charming?\" She smiled at Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix. \"We know all about it.\" Then on her friend's showing such blankness\r\n",
      "as was compatible with such a flush she pursued: \"She does want me to\r\n",
      "have you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix showed a final hesitation, which, however, while Sir Claude\r\n",
      "drummed on the window-pane, she presently surmounted. It came to Maisie\r\n",
      "that in spite of his drumming and of his not turning round he was really\r\n",
      "so much interested as to leave himself in a manner in her hands; which\r\n",
      "somehow suddenly seemed to her a greater proof than he could have given\r\n",
      "by interfering. \"She wants me to have YOU!\" Mrs. Wix declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie answered this bang at Sir Claude. \"Then that's nice for all of\r\n",
      "us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course it was, his continued silence sufficiently admitted while\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix rose from her chair and, as if to take more of a stand, placed\r\n",
      "herself, not without majesty, before the fire. The incongruity of her\r\n",
      "smartness, the circumference of her stiff frock, presented her as really\r\n",
      "more ready for Paris than any of them. She also gazed hard at Sir\r\n",
      "Claude's back. \"Your wife was different from anything she had ever shown\r\n",
      "me. She recognises certain proprieties.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Which? Do you happen to remember?\" Sir Claude asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix's reply was prompt. \"The importance for Maisie of a\r\n",
      "gentlewoman, of some one who's not--well, so bad! She objects to a mere\r\n",
      "maid, and I don't in the least mind telling you what she wants me to\r\n",
      "do.\" One thing was clear--Mrs. Wix was now bold enough for anything.\r\n",
      "\"She wants me to persuade you to get rid of the person from Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie waited for Sir Claude to pronounce on this; then she could only\r\n",
      "understand that he on his side waited, and she felt particularly full of\r\n",
      "common sense as she met her responsibility. \"Oh I don't want Susan with\r\n",
      "YOU!\" she said to Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, always from the window, approved. \"That's quite simple. I'll\r\n",
      "take her back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix gave a positive jump; Maisie caught her look of alarm. \"'Take'\r\n",
      "her? You don't mean to go over on purpose?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude said nothing for a moment; after which, \"Why shouldn't I\r\n",
      "leave you here?\" he enquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, at this, sprang up. \"Oh do, oh do, oh do!\" The next moment she\r\n",
      "was interlaced with Mrs. Wix, and the two, on the hearth-rug, their eyes\r\n",
      "in each other's eyes, considered the plan with intensity. Then Maisie\r\n",
      "felt the difference of what they saw in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She can surely go back alone: why should you put yourself out?\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh she's an idiot--she's incapable. If anything should happen to her\r\n",
      "it would be awkward: it was I who brought her--without her asking. If I\r\n",
      "turn her away I ought with my own hand to place her again exactly where\r\n",
      "I found her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix's face appealed to Maisie on such folly, and her manner,\r\n",
      "as directed to their companion, had, to her pupil's surprise, an\r\n",
      "unprecedented firmness. \"Dear Sir Claude, I think you're perverse. Pay\r\n",
      "her fare and give her a sovereign. She has had an experience that she\r\n",
      "never dreamed of and that will be an advantage to her through life.\r\n",
      "If she goes wrong on the way it will be simply because she wants to,\r\n",
      "and, with her expenses and her remuneration--make it even what you\r\n",
      "like!--you'll have treated her as handsomely as you always treat every\r\n",
      "one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a new tone--as new as Mrs. Wix's cap; and it could strike a\r\n",
      "young person with a sharpened sense for latent meanings as the upshot of\r\n",
      "a relation that had taken on a new character. It brought out for Maisie\r\n",
      "how much more even than she had guessed her friends were fighting side\r\n",
      "by side. At the same time it needed so definite a justification that as\r\n",
      "Sir Claude now at last did face them she at first supposed him merely\r\n",
      "resentful of excessive familiarity. She was therefore yet more puzzled\r\n",
      "to see him show his serene beauty untroubled, as well as an equal\r\n",
      "interest in a matter quite distinct from any freedom but her ladyship's.\r\n",
      "\"Did my wife come alone?\" He could ask even that good-humouredly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When she called on me?\" Mrs. Wix WAS red now: his good humour wouldn't\r\n",
      "keep down her colour, which for a minute glowed there like her ugly\r\n",
      "honesty. \"No--there was some one in the cab.\" The only attenuation she\r\n",
      "could think of was after a minute to add: \"But they didn't come up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude broke into a laugh--Maisie herself could guess what it was\r\n",
      "at: while he now walked about, still laughing, and at the fireplace\r\n",
      "gave a gay kick to a displaced log, she felt more vague about almost\r\n",
      "everything than about the drollery of such a \"they.\" She in fact could\r\n",
      "scarce have told you if it was to deepen or to cover the joke that she\r\n",
      "bethought herself to observe: \"Perhaps it was her maid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix gave her a look that at any rate deprecated the wrong tone. \"It\r\n",
      "was not her maid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean there are this time two?\" Sir Claude asked as if he hadn't\r\n",
      "heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Two maids?\" Maisie went on as if she might assume he had.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The reproach of the straighteners darkened; but Sir Claude cut across it\r\n",
      "with a sudden: \"See here; what do you mean? And what do you suppose SHE\r\n",
      "meant?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix let him for a moment, in silence, understand that the answer\r\n",
      "to his question, if he didn't take care, might give him more than he\r\n",
      "wanted. It was as if, with this scruple, she measured and adjusted all\r\n",
      "she gave him in at last saying: \"What she meant was to make me know that\r\n",
      "you're definitely free. To have that straight from her was a joy I of\r\n",
      "course hadn't hoped for: it made the assurance, and my delight at it, a\r\n",
      "thing I could really proceed upon. You already know now certainly I'd\r\n",
      "have started even if she hadn't pressed me; you already know what, so\r\n",
      "long, we've been looking for and what, as soon as she told me of her\r\n",
      "step taken at Folkestone, I recognised with rapture that we HAVE. It's\r\n",
      "your freedom that makes me right\"--she fairly bristled with her logic.\r\n",
      "\"But I don't mind telling you that it's her action that makes me happy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her action?\" Sir Claude echoed. \"Why, my dear woman, her action is just\r\n",
      "a hideous crime. It happens to satisfy our sympathies in a way that's\r\n",
      "quite delicious; but that doesn't in the least alter the fact that it's\r\n",
      "the most abominable thing ever done. She has chucked our friend here\r\n",
      "overboard not a bit less than if she had shoved her shrieking and\r\n",
      "pleading, out of that window and down two floors to the paving-stones.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie surveyed serenely the parties to the discussion. \"Oh your friend\r\n",
      "here, dear Sir Claude, doesn't plead and shriek!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at her a moment. \"Never. Never. That's one, only one, but\r\n",
      "charming so far as it goes, of about a hundred things we love her for.\"\r\n",
      "Then he pursued to Mrs. Wix: \"What I can't for the life of me make out\r\n",
      "is what Ida is REALLY up to, what game she was playing in turning to you\r\n",
      "with that cursed cheek after the beastly way she has used you. Where--to\r\n",
      "explain her at all--does she fancy she can presently, when we least\r\n",
      "expect it, take it out of us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She doesn't fancy anything, nor want anything out of any one. Her\r\n",
      "cursed cheek, as you call it, is the best thing I've ever seen in her.\r\n",
      "I don't care a fig for the beastly way she used me--I forgive it all a\r\n",
      "thousand times over!\" Mrs. Wix raised her voice as she had never raised\r\n",
      "it; she quite triumphed in her lucidity. \"I understand her, I almost\r\n",
      "admire her!\" she quavered. She spoke as if this might practically\r\n",
      "suffice; yet in charity to fainter lights she threw out an explanation.\r\n",
      "\"As I've said, she was different; upon my word I wouldn't have known\r\n",
      "her. She had a glimmering, she had an instinct; they brought her. It was\r\n",
      "a kind of happy thought, and if you couldn't have supposed she would\r\n",
      "ever have had such a thing, why of course I quite agree with you. But\r\n",
      "she did have it! There!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie could feel again how a certain rude rightness in this plea might\r\n",
      "have been found exasperating; but as she had often watched Sir Claude in\r\n",
      "apprehension of displeasures that didn't come, so now, instead of saying\r\n",
      "\"Oh hell!\" as her father used, she observed him only to take refuge in a\r\n",
      "question that at the worst was abrupt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who IS it this time, do you know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix tried blind dignity. \"Who is what, Sir Claude?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The man who stands the cabs. Who was in the one that waited at your\r\n",
      "door?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this challenge she faltered so long that her young friend's pitying\r\n",
      "conscience gave her a hand. \"It wasn't the Captain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This good intention, however, only converted the excellent woman's\r\n",
      "scruple to a more ambiguous stare; besides of course making Sir Claude\r\n",
      "go off. Mrs. Wix fairly appealed to him. \"Must I really tell you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His amusement continued. \"Did she make you promise not to?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix looked at him still harder. \"I mean before Maisie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude laughed again. \"Why SHE can't hurt him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie felt herself, as it passed, brushed by the light humour of this.\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I can't hurt him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The straighteners again roofed her over; after which they seemed to\r\n",
      "crack with the explosion of their wearer's honesty. Amid the flying\r\n",
      "splinters Mrs. Wix produced a name. \"Mr. Tischbein.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was for an instant a silence that, under Sir Claude's influence\r\n",
      "and while he and Maisie looked at each other, suddenly pretended to be\r\n",
      "that of gravity. \"We don't know Mr. Tischbein, do we, dear?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie gave the point all needful thought. \"No, I can't place Mr.\r\n",
      "Tischbein.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a passage that worked visibly on their friend. \"You must pardon\r\n",
      "me, Sir Claude,\" she said with an austerity of which the note was real,\r\n",
      "\"if I thank God to your face that he has in his mercy--I mean his mercy\r\n",
      "to our charge--allowed me to achieve this act.\" She gave out a long puff\r\n",
      "of pain. \"It was time!\" Then as if still more to point the moral: \"I\r\n",
      "said just now I understood your wife. I said just now I admired her. I\r\n",
      "stand to it: I did both of those things when I saw how even SHE, poor\r\n",
      "thing, saw. If you want the dots on the i's you shall have them. What\r\n",
      "she came to me for, in spite of everything, was that I'm just\"--she\r\n",
      "quavered it out--\"well, just clean! What she saw for her daughter was\r\n",
      "that there must at last be a DECENT person!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie was quick enough to jump a little at the sound of this\r\n",
      "implication that such a person was what Sir Claude was not; the\r\n",
      "next instant, however, she more profoundly guessed against whom the\r\n",
      "discrimination was made. She was therefore left the more surprised at\r\n",
      "the complete candour with which he embraced the worst. \"If she's bent on\r\n",
      "decent persons why has she given her to ME? You don't call me a decent\r\n",
      "person, and I'll do Ida the justice that SHE never did. I think I'm as\r\n",
      "indecent as any one and that there's nothing in my behaviour that makes\r\n",
      "my wife's surrender a bit less ignoble!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't speak of your behaviour!\" Mrs. Wix cried. \"Don't say such\r\n",
      "horrible things; they're false and they're wicked and I forbid you! It's\r\n",
      "to KEEP you decent that I'm here and that I've done everything I have\r\n",
      "done. It's to save you--I won't say from yourself, because in yourself\r\n",
      "you're beautiful and good! It's to save you from the worst person of\r\n",
      "all. I haven't, after all, come over to be afraid to speak of her!\r\n",
      "That's the person in whose place her ladyship wants such a person as\r\n",
      "even me; and if she thought herself, as she as good as told me, not fit\r\n",
      "for Maisie's company, it's not, as you may well suppose, that she may\r\n",
      "make room for Mrs. Beale!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie watched his face as it took this outbreak, and the most she saw\r\n",
      "in it was that it turned a little white. That indeed made him look,\r\n",
      "as Susan Ash would have said, queer; and it was perhaps a part of the\r\n",
      "queerness that he intensely smiled. \"You're too hard on Mrs. Beale. She\r\n",
      "has great merits of her own.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix, at this, instead of immediately replying, did what Sir Claude\r\n",
      "had been doing before: she moved across to the window and stared a while\r\n",
      "into the storm. There was for a minute, to Maisie's sense, a hush that\r\n",
      "resounded with wind and rain. Sir Claude, in spite of these things,\r\n",
      "glanced about for his hat; on which Maisie spied it first and, making\r\n",
      "a dash for it, held it out to him. He took it with a gleam of a\r\n",
      "\"thank-you\" in his face, and then something moved her still to hold the\r\n",
      "other side of the brim; so that, united by their grasp of this object,\r\n",
      "they stood some seconds looking many things at each other. By this time\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix had turned round. \"Do you mean to tell me,\" she demanded, \"that\r\n",
      "you are going back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Mrs. Beale?\" Maisie surrendered his hat, and there was something\r\n",
      "that touched her in the embarrassed, almost humiliated way their\r\n",
      "companion's challenge made him turn it round and round. She had seen\r\n",
      "people do that who, she was sure, did nothing else that Sir Claude did.\r\n",
      "\"I can't just say, my dear thing. We'll see about I--we'll talk of it\r\n",
      "to-morrow. Meantime I must get some air.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix, with her back to the window, threw up her head to a height\r\n",
      "that, still for a moment, had the effect of detaining him. \"All the air\r\n",
      "in France, Sir Claude, won't, I think, give you the courage to deny that\r\n",
      "you're simply afraid of her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh this time he did look queer; Maisie had no need of Susan's vocabulary\r\n",
      "to note it! It would have come to her of itself as, with his hand on\r\n",
      "the door, he turned his eyes from his stepdaughter to her governess and\r\n",
      "then back again. Resting on Maisie's, though for ever so short a time,\r\n",
      "there was something they gave up to her and tried to explain. His lips,\r\n",
      "however, explained nothing; they only surrendered to Mrs. Wix. \"Yes. I'm\r\n",
      "simply afraid of her!\" He opened the door and passed out. It brought\r\n",
      "back to Maisie his confession of fear of her mother; it made her\r\n",
      "stepmother then the second lady about whom he failed of the particular\r\n",
      "virtue that was supposed most to mark a gentleman. In fact there were\r\n",
      "three of them, if she counted in Mrs. Wix, before whom he had undeniably\r\n",
      "quailed. Well, his want of valour was but a deeper appeal to her\r\n",
      "tenderness. To thrill with response to it she had only to remember all\r\n",
      "the ladies she herself had, as they called it, funked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XXIV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It continued to rain so hard that our young lady's private dream of\r\n",
      "explaining the Continent to their visitor had to contain a provision for\r\n",
      "some adequate treatment of the weather. At the _table d'hote_ that evening\r\n",
      "she threw out a variety of lights: this was the second ceremony of the\r\n",
      "sort she had sat through, and she would have neglected her privilege\r\n",
      "and dishonoured her vocabulary--which indeed consisted mainly of the\r\n",
      "names of dishes--if she had not been proportionately ready to dazzle\r\n",
      "with interpretations. Preoccupied and overawed, Mrs. Wix was apparently\r\n",
      "dim: she accepted her pupil's version of the mysteries of the menu in a\r\n",
      "manner that might have struck the child as the depression of a credulity\r\n",
      "conscious not so much of its needs as of its dimensions. Maisie was soon\r\n",
      "enough--though it scarce happened before bedtime--confronted again with\r\n",
      "the different sort of programme for which she reserved her criticism.\r\n",
      "They remounted together to their sitting-room while Sir Claude, who said\r\n",
      "he would join them later, remained below to smoke and to converse with\r\n",
      "the old acquaintances that he met wherever he turned. He had proposed\r\n",
      "his companions, for coffee, the enjoyment of the _salon de lecture_,\r\n",
      "but Mrs. Wix had replied promptly and with something of an air that it\r\n",
      "struck her their own apartments offered them every convenience. They\r\n",
      "offered the good lady herself, Maisie could immediately observe, not\r\n",
      "only that of this rather grand reference, which, already emulous, so\r\n",
      "far as it went, of her pupil, she made as if she had spent her life in\r\n",
      "salons; but that of a stiff French sofa where she could sit and stare at\r\n",
      "the faint French lamp, in default of the French clock that had stopped,\r\n",
      "as for some account of the time Sir Claude would so markedly interpose.\r\n",
      "Her demeanour accused him so directly of hovering beyond her reach that\r\n",
      "Maisie sought to divert her by a report of Susan's quaint attitude on\r\n",
      "the matter of their conversation after lunch. Maisie had mentioned to\r\n",
      "the young woman for sympathy's sake the plan for her relief, but her\r\n",
      "disapproval of alien ways appeared, strange to say, only to prompt her\r\n",
      "to hug her gloom; so that between Mrs. Wix's effect of displacing her\r\n",
      "and the visible stiffening of her back the child had the sense of a\r\n",
      "double office and enlarged play for pacific powers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These powers played to no great purpose, it was true, in keeping before\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix the vision of Sir Claude's perversity, which hung there in the\r\n",
      "pauses of talk and which he himself, after unmistakeable delays, finally\r\n",
      "made quite lurid by bursting in--it was near ten o'clock--with an object\r\n",
      "held up in his hand. She knew before he spoke what it was; she knew at\r\n",
      "least from the underlying sense of all that, since the hour spent after\r\n",
      "the Exhibition with her father, had not sprung up to reinstate Mr.\r\n",
      "Farange--she knew it meant a triumph for Mrs. Beale. The mere present\r\n",
      "sight of Sir Claude's face caused her on the spot to drop straight\r\n",
      "through her last impression of Mr. Farange a plummet that reached still\r\n",
      "deeper down than the security of these days of flight. She had wrapped\r\n",
      "that impression in silence--a silence that had parted with half its veil\r\n",
      "to cover also, from the hour of Sir Claude's advent, the image of Mr.\r\n",
      "Farange's wife. But if the object in Sir Claude's hand revealed itself\r\n",
      "as a letter which he held up very high, so there was something in his\r\n",
      "mere motion that laid Mrs. Beale again bare. \"Here we are!\" he cried\r\n",
      "almost from the door, shaking his trophy at them and looking from one to\r\n",
      "the other. Then he came straight to Mrs. Wix; he had pulled two papers\r\n",
      "out of the envelope and glanced at them again to see which was which. He\r\n",
      "thrust one out open to Mrs. Wix. \"Read that.\" She looked at him hard,\r\n",
      "as if in fear: it was impossible not to see he was excited. Then she\r\n",
      "took the letter, but it was not her face that Maisie watched while she\r\n",
      "read. Neither, for that matter, was it this countenance that Sir Claude\r\n",
      "scanned: he stood before the fire and, more calmly, now that he had\r\n",
      "acted, communed in silence with his stepdaughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The silence was in truth quickly broken; Mrs. Wix rose to her feet with\r\n",
      "the violence of the sound she emitted. The letter had dropped from her\r\n",
      "and lay upon the floor; it had made her turn ghastly white and she was\r\n",
      "speechless with the effect of it. \"It's too abominable--it's too\r\n",
      "unspeakable!\" she then cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't it a charming thing?\" Sir Claude asked. \"It has just arrived,\r\n",
      "enclosed in a word of her own. She sends it on to me with the remark\r\n",
      "that comment's superfluous. I really think it is. That's all you can\r\n",
      "say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She oughtn't to pass such a horror about,\" said Mrs. Wix. \"She ought\r\n",
      "to put it straight in the fire.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear woman, she's not such a fool! It's much too precious.\" He had\r\n",
      "picked the letter up and he gave it again a glance of complacency which\r\n",
      "produced a light in his face. \"Such a document\"--he considered, then\r\n",
      "concluded with a slight drop--\"such a document is, in fine, a basis!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A basis for what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--for proceedings.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hers?\" Mrs. Wix's voice had become outright the voice of derision. \"How\r\n",
      "can SHE proceed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude turned it over. \"How can she get rid of him? Well--she IS rid\r\n",
      "of him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not legally.\" Mrs. Wix had never looked to her pupil so much as if she\r\n",
      "knew what she was talking about.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I dare say,\" Sir Claude laughed; \"but she's not a bit less deprived\r\n",
      "than I!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of the power to get a divorce? It's just your want of the power that\r\n",
      "makes the scandal of your connexion with her. Therefore it's just her\r\n",
      "want of it that makes that of hers with you. That's all I contend!\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix concluded with an unparalleled neigh of battle. Oh she did know what\r\n",
      "she was talking about!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had meanwhile appealed mutely to Sir Claude, who judged it easier\r\n",
      "to meet what she didn't say than to meet what Mrs. Wix did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a letter to Mrs. Beale from your father, my dear, written from\r\n",
      "Spa and making the rupture between them perfectly irrevocable. It lets\r\n",
      "her know, and not in pretty language, that, as we technically say, he\r\n",
      "deserts her. It puts an end for ever to their relations.\" He ran his\r\n",
      "eyes over it again, then appeared to make up his mind. \"In fact it\r\n",
      "concerns you, Maisie, so nearly and refers to you so particularly that\r\n",
      "I really think you ought to see the terms in which this new situation\r\n",
      "is created for you.\" And he held out the letter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix, at this, pounced upon it; she had grabbed it too soon even\r\n",
      "for Maisie to become aware of being rather afraid of it. Thrusting it\r\n",
      "instantly behind her she positively glared at Sir Claude. \"See it,\r\n",
      "wretched man?--the innocent child SEE such a thing? I think you must be\r\n",
      "mad, and she shall not have a glimpse of it while I'm here to prevent!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The breadth of her action had made Sir Claude turn red--he even looked a\r\n",
      "little foolish. \"You think it's too bad, eh? But it's precisely because\r\n",
      "it's bad that it seemed to me it would have a lesson and a virtue for\r\n",
      "her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie could do a quick enough justice to his motive to be able clearly\r\n",
      "to interpose. She fairly smiled at him. \"I assure you I can quite\r\n",
      "believe how bad it is!\" She thought of something, kept it back a moment,\r\n",
      "and then spoke. \"I know what's in it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He of course burst out laughing and, while Mrs. Wix groaned an \"Oh\r\n",
      "heavens!\" replied: \"You wouldn't say that, old boy, if you did! The\r\n",
      "point I make is,\" he continued to Mrs. Wix with a blandness now\r\n",
      "re-established--\"the point I make is simply that it sets Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "free.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She hung fire but an instant. \"Free to live with YOU?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Free not to live, not to pretend to live, with her husband.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah they're mighty different things!\"--a truth as to which her\r\n",
      "earnestness could now with a fine inconsequent look invite the\r\n",
      "participation of the child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before Maisie could commit herself, however, the ground was occupied by\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, who, as he stood before their visitor with an expression\r\n",
      "half rueful, half persuasive, rubbed his hand sharply up and down the\r\n",
      "back of his head. \"Then why the deuce do you grant so--do you, I may\r\n",
      "even say, rejoice so--that by the desertion of my own precious partner\r\n",
      "I'm free?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix met this challenge first with silence, then with a\r\n",
      "demonstration the most extraordinary, the most unexpected. Maisie could\r\n",
      "scarcely believe her eyes as she saw the good lady, with whom she had\r\n",
      "associated no faintest shade of any art of provocation, actually, after\r\n",
      "an upward grimace, give Sir Claude a great giggling insinuating naughty\r\n",
      "slap. \"You wretch--you KNOW why!\" And she turned away. The face that\r\n",
      "with this movement she left him to present to Maisie was to abide with\r\n",
      "his stepdaughter as the very image of stupefaction; but the pair lacked\r\n",
      "time to communicate either amusement or alarm before their admonisher\r\n",
      "was upon them again. She had begun in fact to show infinite variety and\r\n",
      "she flashed about with a still quicker change of tone. \"Have you brought\r\n",
      "me that thing as a pretext for your going over?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude braced himself. \"I can't, after such news, in common decency\r\n",
      "not go over. I mean, don't you know, in common courtesy and humanity.\r\n",
      "My dear lady, you can't chuck a woman that way, especially taking the\r\n",
      "moment when she has been most insulted and wronged. A fellow must behave\r\n",
      "like a gentleman, damn it, dear good Mrs. Wix. We didn't come away, we\r\n",
      "two, to hang right on, you know: it was only to try our paces and just\r\n",
      "put in a few days that might prove to every one concerned that we're in\r\n",
      "earnest. It's exactly because we're in earnest that, dash it, we needn't\r\n",
      "be so awfully particular. I mean, don't you know, we needn't be so\r\n",
      "awfully afraid.\" He showed a vivacity, an intensity of argument, and if\r\n",
      "Maisie counted his words she was all the more ready to swallow after a\r\n",
      "single swift gasp those that, the next thing, she became conscious he\r\n",
      "paused for a reply to. \"We didn't come, old girl, did we,\" he pleaded\r\n",
      "straight, \"to stop right away for ever and put it all in NOW?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had never doubted she could be heroic for him. \"Oh no!\" It was as\r\n",
      "if she had been shocked at the bare thought. \"We're just taking it as\r\n",
      "we find it.\" She had a sudden inspiration, which she backed up with a\r\n",
      "smile. \"We're just seeing what we can afford.\" She had never yet in her\r\n",
      "life made any claim for herself, but she hoped that this time, frankly,\r\n",
      "what she was doing would somehow be counted to her. Indeed she felt Sir\r\n",
      "Claude WAS counting it, though she was afraid to look at him--afraid she\r\n",
      "should show him tears. She looked at Mrs. Wix; she reached her maximum.\r\n",
      "\"I don't think I ought to be bad to Mrs. Beale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She heard, on this, a deep sound, something inarticulate and sweet,\r\n",
      "from Sir Claude; but tears were what Mrs. Wix didn't scruple to show.\r\n",
      "\"Do you think you ought to be bad to ME?\" The question was the more\r\n",
      "disconcerting that Mrs. Wix's emotion didn't deprive her of the\r\n",
      "advantage of her effect. \"If you see that woman again you're lost!\" she\r\n",
      "declared to their companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked at the moony globe of the lamp; he seemed to see\r\n",
      "for an instant what seeing Mrs. Beale would consist of. It was also\r\n",
      "apparently from this vision that he drew strength to return: \"Her\r\n",
      "situation, by what has happened, is completely changed; and it's no\r\n",
      "use your trying to prove to me that I needn't take any account of\r\n",
      "that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you see that woman you're lost!\" Mrs. Wix with greater force\r\n",

      "you here, you and Maisie, as a hostage to fortune, and I promise you by\r\n",
      "all that's sacred that I shall be with you again at the very latest on\r\n",
      "Saturday. I provide you with funds; I install you in these lovely rooms;\r\n",
      "I arrange with the people here that you be treated with every attention\r\n",
      "and supplied with every luxury. The weather, after this, will mend; it\r\n",
      "will be sure to be exquisite. You'll both be as free as air and you can\r\n",
      "roam all over the place and have tremendous larks. You shall have a\r\n",
      "carriage to drive you; the whole house shall be at your call. You'll\r\n",
      "have a magnificent position.\" He paused, he looked from one of his\r\n",
      "companions to the other as to see the impression he had made. Whether or\r\n",
      "no he judged it adequate he subjoined after a moment: \"And you'll oblige\r\n",
      "me above all by not making a fuss.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie could only answer for the impression on herself, though indeed\r\n",
      "from the heart even of Mrs. Wix's rigour there floated to her sense a\r\n",
      "faint fragrance of depraved concession. Maisie had her dumb word for the\r\n",
      "show such a speech could make, for the irresistible charm it could take\r\n",
      "from his dazzling sincerity; and before she could do anything but blink\r\n",
      "at excess of light she heard this very word sound on Mrs. Wix's lips,\r\n",
      "just as if the poor lady had guessed it and wished, snatching it from\r\n",
      "her, to blight it like a crumpled flower. \"You're dreadful, you're\r\n",
      "terrible, for you know but too well that it's not a small thing to me\r\n",
      "that you should address me in terms that are princely!\" Princely was\r\n",
      "what he stood there and looked and sounded; that was what Maisie for the\r\n",
      "occasion found herself reduced to simple worship of him for being. Yet\r\n",
      "strange to say too, as Mrs. Wix went on, an echo rang within her that\r\n",
      "matched the echo she had herself just produced. \"How much you must WANT\r\n",
      "to see her to say such things as that and to be ready to do so much for\r\n",
      "the poor little likes of Maisie and me! She has a hold on you, and you\r\n",
      "know it, and you want to feel it again and--God knows, or at least _I_\r\n",
      "do, what's your motive and desire--enjoy it once more and give yourself\r\n",
      "up to it! It doesn't matter if it's one day or three: enough is as good\r\n",
      "as a feast and the lovely time you'll have with her is something you're\r\n",
      "willing to pay for! I dare say you'd like me to believe that your pay is\r\n",
      "to get her to give you up; but that's a matter on which I strongly urge\r\n",
      "you not to put down your money in advance. Give HER up first. Then pay\r\n",
      "her what you please!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude took this to the end, though there were things in it that\r\n",
      "made him colour, called into his face more of the apprehension than\r\n",
      "Maisie had ever perceived there of a particular sort of shock. She had\r\n",
      "an odd sense that it was the first time she had seen any one but Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix really and truly scandalised, and this fed her inference, which grew\r\n",
      "and grew from moment to moment, that Mrs. Wix was proving more of a\r\n",
      "force to reckon with than either of them had allowed so much room for.\r\n",
      "It was true that, long before, she had obtained a \"hold\" of him, as\r\n",
      "she called it, different in kind from that obtained by Mrs. Beale and\r\n",
      "originally by her ladyship. But Maisie could quite feel with him now\r\n",
      "that he had really not expected this advantage to be driven so home. Oh\r\n",
      "they hadn't at all got to where Mrs. Wix would stop, for the next minute\r\n",
      "she was driving harder than ever. It was the result of his saying with a\r\n",
      "certain dryness, though so kindly that what most affected Maisie in it\r\n",
      "was his patience: \"My dear friend, it's simply a matter in which I must\r\n",
      "judge for myself. You've judged FOR me, I know, a good deal, of late, in\r\n",
      "a way that I appreciate, I assure you, down to the ground. But you can't\r\n",
      "do it always; no one can do that for another, don't you see, in every\r\n",
      "case. There are exceptions, particular cases that turn up and that are\r\n",
      "awfully delicate. It would be too easy if I could shift it all off on\r\n",
      "you: it would be allowing you to incur an amount of responsibility that\r\n",
      "I should simply become quite ashamed of. You'll find, I'm sure, that\r\n",
      "you'll have quite as much as you'll enjoy if you'll be so good as to\r\n",
      "accept the situation as circumstances happen to make it for you and to\r\n",
      "stay here with our friend, till I rejoin you, on the footing of as much\r\n",
      "pleasantness and as much comfort--and I think I have a right to add, to\r\n",
      "both of you, of as much faith in ME--as possible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh he was princely indeed: that came out more and more with every word\r\n",
      "he said and with the particular way he said it, and Maisie could feel\r\n",
      "his monitress stiffen almost with anguish against the increase of his\r\n",
      "spell and then hurl herself as a desperate defence from it into the\r\n",
      "quite confessed poorness of violence, of iteration. \"You're afraid\r\n",
      "of her--afraid, afraid, afraid! Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\" Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "wailed it with a high quaver, then broke down into a long shudder of\r\n",
      "helplessness and woe. The next minute she had flung herself again on\r\n",
      "the lean sofa and had burst into a passion of tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude stood and looked at her a moment; he shook his head slowly,\r\n",
      "altogether tenderly. \"I've already admitted it--I'm in mortal terror;\r\n",
      "so we'll let that settle the question. I think you had best go to bed,\"\r\n",
      "he added; \"you've had a tremendous day and you must both be tired to\r\n",
      "death. I shall not expect you to concern yourselves in the morning\r\n",
      "with my movements. There's an early boat on; I shall have cleared out\r\n",
      "before you're up; and I shall moreover have dealt directly and most\r\n",
      "effectively, I assure you, with the haughty but not quite hopeless Miss\r\n",
      "Ash.\" He turned to his stepdaughter as if at once to take leave of her\r\n",
      "and give her a sign of how, through all tension and friction, they were\r\n",
      "still united in such a way that she at least needn't worry. \"Maisie\r\n",
      "boy!\"--he opened his arms to her. With her culpable lightness she flew\r\n",
      "into them and, while he kissed her, chose the soft method of silence to\r\n",
      "satisfy him, the silence that after battles of talk was the best balm\r\n",
      "she could offer his wounds. They held each other long enough to reaffirm\r\n",
      "intensely their vows; after which they were almost forced apart by Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix's jumping to her feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her jump, either with a quick return or with a final lapse of courage,\r\n",
      "was also to supplication almost abject. \"I beseech you not to take a\r\n",
      "step so miserable and so fatal. I know her but too well, even if you\r\n",
      "jeer at me for saying it; little as I've seen her I know her, I know\r\n",
      "her. I know what she'll do--I see it as I stand here. Since you're\r\n",
      "afraid of her it's the mercy of heaven. Don't, for God's sake, be afraid\r\n",
      "to show it, to profit by it and to arrive at the very safety that it\r\n",
      "gives you. I'M not afraid of her, I assure you; you must already have\r\n",
      "seen for yourself that there's nothing I'm afraid of now. Let me go to\r\n",
      "her--I'LL settle her and I'll take that woman back without a hair of\r\n",
      "her touched. Let me put in the two or three days--let me wind up the\r\n",
      "connexion. You stay here with Maisie, with the carriage and the larks\r\n",
      "and the luxury; then I'll return to you and we'll go off together--we'll\r\n",
      "live together without a cloud. Take me, take me,\" she went on and\r\n",
      "on--the tide of her eloquence was high. \"Here I am; I know what I am\r\n",
      "and what I ain't; but I say boldly to the face of you both that I'll do\r\n",
      "better for you, far, than ever she'll even try to. I say it to yours,\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, even though I owe you the very dress on my back and the very\r\n",
      "shoes on my feet. I owe you everything--that's just the reason; and to\r\n",
      "pay it back, in profusion, what can that be but what I want? Here I am,\r\n",
      "here I am!\"--she spread herself into an exhibition that, combined with\r\n",
      "her intensity and her decorations, appeared to suggest her for strange\r\n",
      "offices and devotions, for ridiculous replacements and substitutions.\r\n",
      "She manipulated her gown as she talked, she insisted on the items of\r\n",
      "her debt. \"I have nothing of my own, I know--no money, no clothes, no\r\n",
      "appearance, no anything, nothing but my hold of this little one truth,\r\n",
      "which is all in the world I can bribe you with: that the pair of you are\r\n",
      "more to me than all besides, and that if you'll let me help you and save\r\n",
      "you, make what you both want possible in the one way it CAN be, why,\r\n",
      "I'll work myself to the bone in your service!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude wavered there without an answer to this magnificent appeal;\r\n",
      "he plainly cast about for one, and in no small agitation and pain. He\r\n",
      "addressed himself in his quest, however, only to vague quarters until he\r\n",
      "met again, as he so frequently and actively met it, the more than filial\r\n",
      "gaze of his intelligent little charge. That gave him--poor plastic and\r\n",
      "dependent male--his issue. If she was still a child she was yet of\r\n",
      "the sex that could help him out. He signified as much by a renewed\r\n",
      "invitation to an embrace. She freshly sprang to him and again they\r\n",
      "inaudibly conversed. \"Be nice to her, be nice to her,\" he at last\r\n",
      "distinctly articulated; \"be nice to her as you've not even been to ME!\"\r\n",
      "On which, without another look at Mrs. Wix, he somehow got out of the\r\n",

      "she presently noticed, by any scheme of revenge for Sir Claude's flight\r\n",
      "which should take on Mrs. Wix's part the form of a refusal to avail\r\n",
      "herself of the facilities he had so bravely ordered. It was in fact\r\n",
      "impossible to escape them; it was in the good lady's own phrase\r\n",
      "ridiculous to go on foot when you had a carriage prancing at the door.\r\n",
      "Everything about them pranced: the very waiters even as they presented\r\n",
      "the dishes to which, from a similar sense of the absurdity of\r\n",
      "perversity, Mrs. Wix helped herself with a freedom that spoke to Maisie\r\n",
      "quite as much of her depletion as of her logic. Her appetite was a sign\r\n",
      "to her companion of a great many things and testified no less on the\r\n",
      "whole to her general than to her particular condition. She had arrears\r\n",
      "of dinner to make up, and it was touching that in a dinnerless state\r\n",
      "her moral passion should have burned so clear. She partook largely as\r\n",
      "a refuge from depression, and yet the opportunity to partake was just\r\n",
      "a mark of the sinister symptoms that depressed her. The affair was\r\n",
      "in short a combat, in which the baser element triumphed, between her\r\n",
      "refusal to be bought off and her consent to be clothed and fed. It was\r\n",
      "not at any rate to be gainsaid that there was comfort for her in the\r\n",
      "developments of France; comfort so great as to leave Maisie free to take\r\n",
      "with her all the security for granted and brush all the danger aside.\r\n",
      "That was the way to carry out in detail Sir Claude's injunction to be\r\n",
      "\"nice\"; that was the way, as well, to look, with her, in a survey of the\r\n",
      "pleasures of life abroad, straight over the head of any doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They shrank at last, all doubts, as the weather cleared up: it had an\r\n",
      "immense effect on them and became quite as lovely as Sir Claude had\r\n",
      "engaged. This seemed to have put him so into the secret of things, and\r\n",
      "the joy of the world so waylaid the steps of his friends, that little by\r\n",
      "little the spirit of hope filled the air and finally took possession of\r\n",
      "the scene. To drive on the long cliff was splendid, but it was perhaps\r\n",
      "better still to creep in the shade--for the sun was strong--along the\r\n",
      "many-coloured and many-odoured port and through the streets in which, to\r\n",
      "English eyes, everything that was the same was a mystery and everything\r\n",
      "that was different a joke. Best of all was to continue the creep up the\r\n",
      "long Grand' Rue to the gate of the _haute ville_ and, passing beneath\r\n",
      "it, mount to the quaint and crooked rampart, with its rows of trees,\r\n",
      "its quiet corners and friendly benches where brown old women in such\r\n",
      "white-frilled caps and such long gold earrings sat and knitted or\r\n",
      "snoozed, its little yellow-faced houses that looked like the homes of\r\n",
      "misers or of priests and its dark chateau where small soldiers lounged\r\n",
      "on the bridge that stretched across an empty moat and military washing\r\n",
      "hung from the windows of towers. This was a part of the place that could\r\n",
      "lead Maisie to enquire if it didn't just meet one's idea of the middle\r\n",
      "ages; and since it was rather a satisfaction than a shock to perceive,\r\n",
      "and not for the first time, the limits in Mrs. Wix's mind of the\r\n",
      "historic imagination, that only added one more to the variety of kinds\r\n",
      "of insight that she felt it her own present mission to show. They sat\r\n",
      "together on the old grey bastion; they looked down on the little new\r\n",
      "town which seemed to them quite as old, and across at the great dome and\r\n",
      "the high gilt Virgin of the church that, as they gathered, was famous\r\n",
      "and that pleased them by its unlikeness to any place in which they\r\n",
      "had worshipped. They wandered in this temple afterwards and Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "confessed that for herself she had probably made a fatal mistake early\r\n",
      "in life in not being a Catholic. Her confession in its turn caused\r\n",
      "Maisie to wonder rather interestedly what degree of lateness it was\r\n",
      "that shut the door against an escape from such an error. They went back\r\n",
      "to the rampart on the second morning--the spot on which they appeared\r\n",
      "to have come furthest in the journey that was to separate them from\r\n",
      "everything objectionable in the past: it gave them afresh the impression\r\n",
      "that had most to do with their having worked round to a confidence that\r\n",
      "on Maisie's part was determined and that she could see to be on her\r\n",
      "companion's desperate. She had had for many hours the sense of showing\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix so much that she was comparatively slow to become conscious\r\n",
      "of being at the same time the subject of a like aim. The business went\r\n",
      "the faster, however, from the moment she got her glimpse of it; it then\r\n",
      "fell into its place in her general, her habitual view of the particular\r\n",
      "phenomenon that, had she felt the need of words for it, she might have\r\n",
      "called her personal relation to her knowledge. This relation had never\r\n",
      "been so lively as during the time she waited with her old governess for\r\n",
      "Sir Claude's reappearance, and what made it so was exactly that Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "struck her as having a new suspicion of it. Mrs. Wix had never yet had a\r\n",
      "suspicion--this was certain--so calculated to throw her pupil, in spite\r\n",
      "of the closer union of such adventurous hours, upon the deep defensive.\r\n",
      "Her pupil made out indeed as many marvels as she had made out on the\r\n",
      "rush to Folkestone; and if in Sir Claude's company on that occasion Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix was the constant implication, so in Mrs. Wix's, during these hours,\r\n",
      "Sir Claude was--and most of all through long pauses--the perpetual, the\r\n",
      "insurmountable theme. It all took them back to the first flush of his\r\n",
      "marriage and to the place he held in the schoolroom at that crisis of\r\n",
      "love and pain; only he had himself blown to a much bigger balloon the\r\n",
      "large consciousness he then filled out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They went through it all again, and indeed while the interval dragged\r\n",
      "by the very weight of its charm they went, in spite of defences and\r\n",
      "suspicions, through everything. Their intensified clutch of the future\r\n",
      "throbbed like a clock ticking seconds; but this was a timepiece that\r\n",
      "inevitably, as well, at the best, rang occasionally a portentous hour.\r\n",
      "Oh there were several of these, and two or three of the worst on the old\r\n",
      "city-wall where everything else so made for peace. There was nothing\r\n",
      "in the world Maisie more wanted than to be as nice to Mrs. Wix as Sir\r\n",
      "Claude had desired; but it was exactly because this fell in with her\r\n",
      "inveterate instinct of keeping the peace that the instinct itself\r\n",
      "was quickened. From the moment it was quickened, however, it found\r\n",
      "other work, and that was how, to begin with, she produced the very\r\n",
      "complication she most sought to avert. What she had essentially done,\r\n",
      "these days, had been to read the unspoken into the spoken; so that thus,\r\n",
      "with accumulations, it had become more definite to her that the unspoken\r\n",
      "was, unspeakably, the completeness of the sacrifice of Mrs. Beale. There\r\n",
      "were times when every minute that Sir Claude stayed away was like a nail\r\n",
      "in Mrs. Beale's coffin. That brought back to Maisie--it was a roundabout\r\n",
      "way--the beauty and antiquity of her connexion with the flower of the\r\n",
      "Overmores as well as that lady's own grace and charm, her peculiar\r\n",
      "prettiness and cleverness and even her peculiar tribulations. A hundred\r\n",
      "things hummed at the back of her head, but two of these were simple\r\n",
      "enough. Mrs. Beale was by the way, after all, just her stepmother\r\n",
      "and her relative. She was just--and partly for that very reason--Sir\r\n",
      "Claude's greatest intimate (\"lady-intimate\" was Maisie's term) so that\r\n",
      "what together they were on Mrs. Wix's prescription to give up and break\r\n",
      "short off with was for one of them his particular favourite and for the\r\n",
      "other her father's wife. Strangely, indescribably her perception of\r\n",
      "reasons kept pace with her sense of trouble; but there was something in\r\n",
      "her that, without a supreme effort not to be shabby, couldn't take the\r\n",
      "reasons for granted. What it comes to perhaps for ourselves is that,\r\n",
      "disinherited and denuded as we have seen her, there still lingered in\r\n",
      "her life an echo of parental influence--she was still reminiscent of\r\n",
      "one of the sacred lessons of home. It was the only one she retained,\r\n",
      "but luckily she retained it with force. She enjoyed in a word an\r\n",
      "ineffaceable view of the fact that there were things papa called mamma\r\n",
      "and mamma called papa a low sneak for doing or for not doing. Now this\r\n",
      "rich memory gave her a name that she dreaded to invite to the lips of\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale: she should personally wince so just to hear it. The very\r\n",
      "sweetness of the foreign life she was steeped in added with each hour\r\n",
      "of Sir Claude's absence to the possibility of such pangs. She watched\r\n",
      "beside Mrs. Wix the great golden Madonna, and one of the ear-ringed old\r\n",
      "women who had been sitting at the end of their bench got up and pottered\r\n",
      "away. \"Adieu mesdames!\" said the old woman in a little cracked civil\r\n",
      "voice--a demonstration by which our friends were so affected that they\r\n",
      "bobbed up and almost curtseyed to her. They subsided again, and it was\r\n",
      "shortly after, in a summer hum of French insects and a phase of almost\r\n",
      "somnolent reverie, that Maisie most had the vision of what it was to\r\n",
      "shut out from such a perspective so appealing a participant. It had not\r\n",
      "yet appeared so vast as at that moment, this prospect of statues shining\r\n",
      "in the blue and of courtesy in romantic forms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why after all should we have to choose between you? Why shouldn't we\r\n",
      "be four?\" she finally demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix gave the jerk of a sleeper awakened or the start even of one\r\n",
      "who hears a bullet whiz at the flag of truce. Her stupefaction at\r\n",
      "such a breach of the peace delayed for a moment her answer. \"Four\r\n",
      "improprieties, do you mean? Because two of us happen to be decent\r\n",
      "people! Do I gather you to wish that I should stay on with you even\r\n",
      "if that woman IS capable--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie took her up before she could further phrase Mrs. Beale's\r\n",
      "capability. \"Stay on as MY companion--yes. Stay on as just what you\r\n",
      "were at mamma's. Mrs. Beale WOULD let you!\" the child said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix had by this time fairly sprung to her arms. \"And who, I'd like\r\n",
      "to know, would let Mrs. Beale? Do you mean, little unfortunate, that YOU\r\n",
      "would?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not, if now she's free?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Free? Are you imitating HIM? Well, if Sir Claude's old enough to know\r\n",
      "better, upon my word I think it's right to treat you as if you also\r\n",
      "were. You'll have to, at any rate--to know better--if that's the line\r\n",
      "you're proposing to take.\" Mrs. Wix had never been so harsh; but on the\r\n",
      "other hand Maisie could guess that she herself had never appeared so\r\n",
      "wanton. What was underlying, however, rather overawed than angered her;\r\n",
      "she felt she could still insist--not for contradiction, but for ultimate\r\n",
      "calm. Her wantonness meanwhile continued to work upon her friend, who\r\n",
      "caught again, on the rebound, the sound of deepest provocation. \"Free,\r\n",
      "free, free? If she's as free as YOU are, my dear, she's free enough, to\r\n",
      "be sure!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As I am?\"--Maisie, after reflexion and despite whatever of portentous\r\n",
      "this seemed to convey, risked a critical echo.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Wix, \"nobody, you know, is free to commit a crime.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A crime!\" The word had come out in a way that made the child sound it\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'd commit as great a one as their own--and so should I--if we were\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her companion now turned upon her with a reproach softer because it was\r\n",

      "about?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix made little of her valour. \"I can promise you that, whatever\r\n",

      "immorality when you've seen with your own eyes that Sir Claude has felt\r\n",
      "it to be so to that dire extent that, rather than make you face the\r\n",
      "shame of it, he has for months kept away from you altogether? Is it any\r\n",
      "more difficult to see that the first time he tries to do his duty he\r\n",

      "disingenuous as of being precisely accused of the meanness that had\r\n",

      "and Mrs. Wix seemed to flaunt there in her finery. \"Then doesn't he pay\r\n",
      "YOU too?\" her unhappy charge demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this she bounded in her place. \"Oh you incredible little waif!\"\r\n",
      "She brought it out with a wail of violence; after which, with another\r\n",
      "convulsion, she marched straight away.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing so dreadful of course could be final or even for many minutes\r\n",
      "prolonged: they rushed together again too soon for either to feel that\r\n",
      "either had kept it up, and though they went home in silence it was with\r\n",
      "a vivid perception for Maisie that her companion's hand had closed upon\r\n",
      "her. That hand had shown altogether, these twenty-four hours, a new\r\n",
      "capacity for closing, and one of the truths the child could least resist\r\n",
      "was that a certain greatness had now come to Mrs. Wix. The case was\r\n",
      "indeed that the quality of her motive surpassed the sharpness of her\r\n",
      "angles; both the combination and the singularity of which things, when\r\n",
      "in the afternoon they used the carriage, Maisie could borrow from the\r\n",
      "contemplative hush of their grandeur the freedom to feel to the utmost.\r\n",
      "She still bore the mark of the tone in which her friend had thrown out\r\n",
      "that threat of never losing sight of her. This friend had been converted\r\n",
      "in short from feebleness to force; and it was the light of her new\r\n",
      "authority that showed from how far she had come. The threat in question,\r\n",
      "sharply exultant, might have produced defiance; but before anything so\r\n",
      "ugly could happen another process had insidiously forestalled it. The\r\n",
      "moment at which this process had begun to mature was that of Mrs. Wix's\r\n",
      "breaking out with a dignity attuned to their own apartments and with an\r\n",
      "advantage now measurably gained. They had ordered coffee after luncheon,\r\n",
      "in the spirit of Sir Claude's provision, and it was served to them while\r\n",
      "they awaited their equipage in the white and gold saloon. It was flanked\r\n",
      "moreover with a couple of liqueurs, and Maisie felt that Sir Claude\r\n",
      "could scarce have been taken more at his word had it been followed\r\n",
      "by anecdotes and cigarettes. The influence of these luxuries was\r\n",
      "at any rate in the air. It seemed to her while she tiptoed at the\r\n",
      "chimney-glass, pulling on her gloves and with a motion of her head\r\n",
      "shaking a feather into place, to have had something to do with Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix's suddenly saying: \"Haven't you really and truly ANY moral sense?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie was aware that her answer, though it brought her down to her\r\n",
      "heels, was vague even to imbecility, and that this was the first time\r\n",
      "she had appeared to practise with Mrs. Wix an intellectual inaptitude to\r\n",
      "meet her--the infirmity to which she had owed so much success with papa\r\n",
      "and mamma. The appearance did her injustice, for it was not less through\r\n",
      "her candour than through her playfellow's pressure that after this the\r\n",
      "idea of a moral sense mainly coloured their intercourse. She began, the\r\n",
      "poor child, with scarcely knowing what it was; but it proved something\r\n",
      "that, with scarce an outward sign save her surrender to the swing of the\r\n",
      "carriage, she could, before they came back from their drive, strike up a\r\n",
      "sort of acquaintance with. The beauty of the day only deepened, and the\r\n",
      "splendour of the afternoon sea, and the haze of the far headlands, and\r\n",
      "the taste of the sweet air. It was the coachman indeed who, smiling and\r\n",
      "cracking his whip, turning in his place, pointing to invisible objects\r\n",
      "and uttering unintelligible sounds--all, our tourists recognised, strict\r\n",
      "features of a social order principally devoted to language: it was this\r\n",
      "polite person, I say, who made their excursion fall so much short that\r\n",
      "their return left them still a stretch of the long daylight and an hour\r\n",
      "that, at his obliging suggestion, they spent on foot by the shining\r\n",
      "sands. Maisie had seen the _plage_ the day before with Sir Claude, but\r\n",
      "that was a reason the more for showing on the spot to Mrs. Wix that it\r\n",
      "was, as she said, another of the places on her list and of the things of\r\n",
      "which she knew the French name. The bathers, so late, were absent and\r\n",
      "the tide was low; the sea-pools twinkled in the sunset and there were\r\n",
      "dry places as well, where they could sit again and admire and expatiate:\r\n",
      "a circumstance that, while they listened to the lap of the waves, gave\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix a fresh support for her challenge. \"Have you absolutely none at\r\n",
      "all?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had no need now, as to the question itself at least, to be specific;\r\n",
      "that on the other hand was the eventual result of their quiet conjoined\r\n",
      "apprehension of the thing that--well, yes, since they must face\r\n",
      "it--Maisie absolutely and appallingly had so little of. This marked more\r\n",
      "particularly the moment of the child's perceiving that her friend had\r\n",
      "risen to a level which might--till superseded at all events--pass almost\r\n",
      "for sublime. Nothing more remarkable had taken place in the first heat\r\n",
      "of her own departure, no act of perception less to be overtraced by our\r\n",
      "rough method, than her vision, the rest of that Boulogne day, of the\r\n",
      "manner in which she figured. I so despair of courting her noiseless\r\n",
      "mental footsteps here that I must crudely give you my word for its being\r\n",
      "from this time forward a picture literally present to her. Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "saw her as a little person knowing so extraordinarily much that, for\r\n",
      "the account to be taken of it, what she still didn't know would be\r\n",
      "ridiculous if it hadn't been embarrassing. Mrs. Wix was in truth more\r\n",
      "than ever qualified to meet embarrassment; I am not sure that Maisie had\r\n",
      "not even a dim discernment of the queer law of her own life that made\r\n",
      "her educate to that sort of proficiency those elders with whom she was\r\n",
      "concerned. She promoted, as it were, their development; nothing could\r\n",
      "have been more marked for instance than her success in promoting Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale's. She judged that if her whole history, for Mrs. Wix, had been\r\n",
      "the successive stages of her knowledge, so the very climax of the\r\n",
      "concatenation would, in the same view, be the stage at which the\r\n",
      "knowledge should overflow. As she was condemned to know more and more,\r\n",
      "how could it logically stop before she should know Most? It came to her\r\n",
      "in fact as they sat there on the sands that she was distinctly on the\r\n",
      "road to know Everything. She had not had governesses for nothing: what\r\n",
      "in the world had she ever done but learn and learn and learn? She looked\r\n",
      "at the pink sky with a placid foreboding that she soon should have\r\n",
      "learnt All. They lingered in the flushed air till at last it turned\r\n",
      "to grey and she seemed fairly to receive new information from every\r\n",
      "brush of the breeze. By the time they moved homeward it was as if this\r\n",
      "inevitability had become for Mrs. Wix a long, tense cord, twitched by\r\n",
      "a nervous hand, on which the valued pearls of intelligence were to be\r\n",
      "neatly strung.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the evening upstairs they had another strange sensation, as to which\r\n",
      "Maisie couldn't afterwards have told you whether it was bang in the\r\n",
      "middle or quite at the beginning that her companion sounded with fresh\r\n",
      "emphasis the note of the moral sense. What mattered was merely that she\r\n",
      "did exclaim, and again, as at first appeared, most disconnectedly: \"God\r\n",
      "help me, it does seem to peep out!\" Oh the queer confusions that had\r\n",
      "wooed it at last to such peeping! None so queer, however, as the words\r\n",
      "of woe, and it might verily be said of rage, in which the poor lady\r\n",
      "bewailed the tragic end of her own rich ignorance. There was a point at\r\n",
      "which she seized the child and hugged her as close as in the old days of\r\n",
      "partings and returns; at which she was visibly at a loss how to make up\r\n",
      "to such a victim for such contaminations: appealing, as to what she had\r\n",
      "done and was doing, in bewilderment, in explanation, in supplication,\r\n",
      "for reassurance, for pardon and even outright for pity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know what I've said to you, my own: I don't know what I'm\r\n",
      "saying or what the turn you've given my life has rendered me, heaven\r\n",
      "forgive me, capable of saying. Have I lost all delicacy, all decency,\r\n",
      "all measure of how far and how bad? It seems to me mostly that I have,\r\n",
      "though I'm the last of whom you would ever have thought it. I've just\r\n",
      "done it for YOU, precious--not to lose you, which would have been worst\r\n",
      "of all: so that I've had to pay with my own innocence, if you do laugh!\r\n",
      "for clinging to you and keeping you. Don't let me pay for nothing; don't\r\n",
      "let me have been thrust for nothing into such horrors and such shames. I\r\n",
      "never knew anything about them and I never wanted to know! Now I know\r\n",
      "too much, too much!\" the poor woman lamented and groaned. \"I know so\r\n",
      "much that with hearing such talk I ask myself where I am; and with\r\n",
      "uttering it too, which is worse, say to myself that I'm far, too far,\r\n",
      "from where I started! I ask myself what I should have thought with my\r\n",
      "lost one if I had heard myself cross the line. There are lines I've\r\n",
      "crossed with YOU where I should have fancied I had come to a pretty\r\n",
      "pass--\" She gasped at the mere supposition. \"I've gone from one thing to\r\n",
      "another, and all for the real love of you; and now what would any one\r\n",
      "say--I mean any one but THEM--if they were to hear the way I go on? I've\r\n",
      "had to keep up with you, haven't I?--and therefore what could I do less\r\n",
      "than look to you to keep up with ME? But it's not THEM that are the\r\n",
      "worst--by which I mean to say it's not HIM: it's your dreadfully base\r\n",
      "papa and the one person in the world whom he could have found, I do\r\n",
      "believe--and she's not the Countess, duck--wickeder than himself. While\r\n",
      "they were about it at any rate, since they WERE ruining you, they might\r\n",
      "have done it so as to spare an honest woman. Then I shouldn't have had\r\n",
      "to do whatever it is that's the worst: throw up at you the badness you\r\n",
      "haven't taken in, or find my advantage in the vileness you HAVE! What I\r\n",
      "did lose patience at this morning was at how it was that without your\r\n",
      "seeming to condemn--for you didn't, you remember!--you yet did seem to\r\n",
      "KNOW. Thank God, in his mercy, at last, IF you do!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night, this time, was warm, and one of the windows stood open to the\r\n",
      "small balcony over the rail of which, on coming back from dinner, Maisie\r\n",
      "had hung a long time in the enjoyment of the chatter, the lights, the\r\n",
      "life of the quay made brilliant by the season and the hour. Mrs. Wix's\r\n",
      "requirements had drawn her in from this pasture and Mrs. Wix's embrace\r\n",
      "had detained her even though midway in the outpouring her confusion\r\n",
      "and sympathy had permitted, or rather had positively helped, her to\r\n",
      "disengage herself. But the casement was still wide, the spectacle, the\r\n",
      "pleasure were still there, and from her place in the room, which, with\r\n",
      "its polished floor and its panels of elegance, was lighted from without\r\n",
      "more than from within, the child could still take account of them. She\r\n",
      "appeared to watch and listen; after which she answered Mrs. Wix with a\r\n",
      "question. \"If I do know--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you do condemn.\" The correction was made with some austerity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had the effect of causing Maisie to heave a vague sigh of oppression\r\n",
      "and then after an instant and as if under cover of this ambiguity pass\r\n",
      "out again upon the balcony. She hung again over the rail; she felt the\r\n",
      "summer night; she dropped down into the manners of France. There was\r\n",
      "a cafe below the hotel, before which, with little chairs and tables,\r\n",
      "people sat on a space enclosed by plants in tubs; and the impression was\r\n",
      "enriched by the flash of the white aprons of waiters and the music of a\r\n",
      "man and a woman who, from beyond the precinct, sent up the strum of a\r\n",
      "guitar and the drawl of a song about \"amour.\" Maisie knew what \"amour\"\r\n",
      "meant too, and wondered if Mrs. Wix did: Mrs. Wix remained within, as\r\n",
      "still as a mouse and perhaps not reached by the performance. After\r\n",
      "a while, but not till the musicians had ceased and begun to circulate\r\n",
      "with a little plate, her pupil came back to her. \"IS it a crime?\" Maisie\r\n",
      "then asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix was as prompt as if she had been crouching in a lair. \"Branded\r\n",
      "by the Bible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, he won't commit a crime.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix looked at her gloomily. \"He's committing one now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In being with her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had it on her tongue's end to return once more: \"But now he's\r\n",
      "free.\" She remembered, however, in time that one of the things she had\r\n",
      "known for the last entire hour was that this made no difference. After\r\n",
      "that, and as if to turn the right way, she was on the point of a blind\r\n",
      "dash, a weak reversion to the reminder that it might make a difference,\r\n",
      "might diminish the crime for Mrs. Beale; till such a reflexion was in\r\n",
      "its order also quashed by the visibility in Mrs. Wix's face of the\r\n",
      "collapse produced by her inference from her pupil's manner that after\r\n",
      "all her pains her pupil didn't even yet adequately understand. Never so\r\n",
      "much as when confronted had Maisie wanted to understand, and all her\r\n",
      "thought for a minute centred in the effort to come out with something\r\n",
      "which should be a disproof of her simplicity. \"Just TRUST me, dear;\r\n",
      "that's all!\"--she came out finally with that; and it was perhaps a good\r\n",
      "sign of her action that with a long, impartial moan Mrs. Wix floated her\r\n",
      "to bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no letter the next morning from Sir Claude--which Mrs. Wix let\r\n",
      "out that she deemed the worst of omens; yet it was just for the quieter\r\n",
      "communion they so got with him that, when after the coffee and rolls\r\n",
      "which made them more foreign than ever, it came to going forth for fresh\r\n",
      "drafts upon his credit they wandered again up the hill to the rampart\r\n",
      "instead of plunging into distraction with the crowd on the sands or into\r\n",
      "the sea with the semi-nude bathers. They gazed once more at their gilded\r\n",
      "Virgin; they sank once more upon their battered bench; they felt once\r\n",
      "more their distance from the Regent's Park. At last Mrs. Wix became\r\n",
      "definite about their friend's silence. \"He IS afraid of her! She has\r\n",
      "forbidden him to write.\" The fact of his fear Maisie already knew; but\r\n",
      "her companion's mention of it had at this moment two unexpected results.\r\n",
      "The first was her wondering in dumb remonstrance how Mrs. Wix, with\r\n",
      "a devotion not after all inferior to her own, could put into such an\r\n",
      "allusion such a grimness of derision; the second was that she found\r\n",
      "herself suddenly drop into a deeper view of it. She too had been afraid,\r\n",
      "as we have seen, of the people of whom Sir Claude was afraid, and by\r\n",
      "that law she had had her due measure of latest apprehension of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale. What occurred at present, however, was that, whereas this\r\n",
      "sympathy appeared vain as for him, the ground of it loomed dimly as a\r\n",
      "reason for selfish alarm. That uneasiness had not carried her far before\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix spoke again and with an abruptness so great as almost to seem\r\n",
      "irrelevant. \"Has it never occurred to you to be jealous of her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It never had in the least; yet the words were scarce in the air before\r\n",
      "Maisie had jumped at them. She held them well, she looked at them hard;\r\n",
      "at last she brought out with an assurance which there was no one, alas,\r\n",
      "but herself to admire: \"Well, yes--since you ask me.\" She debated, then\r\n",
      "continued: \"Lots of times!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix glared askance an instant; such approval as her look expressed\r\n",
      "was not wholly unqualified. It expressed at any rate something that\r\n",
      "presumably had to do with her saying once more: \"Yes. He's afraid of\r\n",
      "her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie heard, and it had afresh its effect on her even through the\r\n",
      "blur of the attention now required by the possibility of that idea of\r\n",
      "jealousy--a possibility created only by her feeling she had thus found\r\n",
      "the way to show she was not simple. It struck out of Mrs. Wix that\r\n",
      "this lady still believed her moral sense to be interested and feigned;\r\n",
      "so what could be such a gage of her sincerity as a peep of the most\r\n",
      "restless of the passions? Such a revelation would baffle discouragement,\r\n",
      "and discouragement was in fact so baffled that, helped in some degree\r\n",
      "by the mere intensity of their need to hope, which also, according to\r\n",
      "its nature, sprang from the dark portent of the absent letter, the real\r\n",
      "pitch of their morning was reached by the note, not of mutual scrutiny,\r\n",
      "but of unprecedented frankness. There were broodings indeed and\r\n",
      "silences, and Maisie sank deeper into the vision that for her friend\r\n",
      "she was, at the most, superficial, and that also, positively, she was\r\n",
      "the more so the more she tried to appear complete. Was the sum of all\r\n",
      "knowledge only to know how little in this presence one would ever reach\r\n",
      "it? The answer to that question luckily lost itself in the brightness\r\n",
      "suffusing the scene as soon as Maisie had thrown out in regard to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale such a remark as she had never dreamed she should live to make.\r\n",
      "\"If I thought she was unkind to him--I don't know WHAT I should do!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix dropped one of her squints; she even confirmed it by a wild\r\n",
      "grunt. \"I know what _I_ should!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie at this felt that she lagged. \"Well, I can think of ONE thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix more directly challenged her. \"What is it then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie met her expression as if it were a game with forfeits for\r\n",
      "winking. \"I'd KILL her!\" That at least, she hoped as she looked away,\r\n",
      "would guarantee her moral sense. She looked away, but her companion said\r\n",
      "nothing for so long that she at last turned her head again. Then she saw\r\n",
      "the straighteners all blurred with tears which after a little seemed to\r\n",
      "have sprung from her own eyes. There were tears in fact on both sides of\r\n",
      "the spectacles, and they were even so thick that it was presently all\r\n",
      "Maisie could do to make out through them that slowly, finally Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "put forth a hand. It was the material pressure that settled this and\r\n",
      "even at the end of some minutes more things besides. It settled in its\r\n",
      "own way one thing in particular, which, though often, between them,\r\n",
      "heaven knew, hovered round and hung over, was yet to be established\r\n",
      "without the shadow of an attenuating smile. Oh there was no gleam of\r\n",
      "levity, as little of humour as of deprecation, in the long time they now\r\n",
      "sat together or in the way in which at some unmeasured point of it Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix became distinct enough for her own dignity and yet not loud enough\r\n",
      "for the snoozing old women.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I adore him. I adore him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie took it well in; so well that in a moment more she would have\r\n",
      "answered profoundly: \"So do I.\" But before that moment passed something\r\n",
      "took place that brought other words to her lips; nothing more, very\r\n",
      "possibly, than the closer consciousness in her hand of the significance\r\n",
      "of Mrs. Wix's. Their hands remained linked in unutterable sign of their\r\n",
      "union, and what Maisie at last said was simply and serenely: \"Oh I\r\n",
      "know!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their hands were so linked and their union was so confirmed that it took\r\n",
      "the far deep note of a bell, borne to them on the summer air, to call\r\n",
      "them back to a sense of hours and proprieties. They had touched bottom\r\n",
      "and melted together, but they gave a start at last: the bell was the\r\n",
      "voice of the inn and the inn was the image of luncheon. They should be\r\n",
      "late for it; they got up, and their quickened step on the return had\r\n",
      "something of the swing of confidence. When they reached the hotel the\r\n",
      "_table d'hote_ had begun; this was clear from the threshold, clear\r\n",
      "from the absence in the hall and on the stairs of the \"personnel,\"\r\n",
      "as Mrs. Wix said--she had picked THAT up--all collected in the\r\n",
      "dining-room. They mounted to their apartments for a brush before the\r\n",
      "glass, and it was Maisie who, in passing and from a vain impulse,\r\n",
      "threw open the white and gold door. She was thus first to utter the\r\n",
      "sound that brought Mrs. Wix almost on top of her, as by the other\r\n",
      "accident it would have brought her on top of Mrs. Wix. It had at any\r\n",
      "rate the effect of leaving them bunched together in a strained stare\r\n",
      "at their new situation. This situation had put on in a flash the\r\n",
      "bright form of Mrs. Beale: she stood there in her hat and her jacket,\r\n",
      "amid bags and shawls, smiling and holding out her arms. If she had\r\n",
      "just arrived it was a different figure from either of the two that for\r\n",
      "THEIR benefit, wan and tottering and none too soon to save life, the\r\n",
      "Channel had recently disgorged. She was as lovely as the day that had\r\n",
      "brought her over, as fresh as the luck and the health that attended\r\n",
      "her: it came to Maisie on the spot that she was more beautiful than\r\n",
      "she had ever been. All this was too quick to count, but there was\r\n",
      "still time in it to give the child the sense of what had kindled the\r\n",
      "light. That leaped out of the open arms, the open eyes, the open\r\n",
      "mouth; it leaped out with Mrs. Beale's loud cry at her: \"I'm free,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The greatest wonder of all was the way Mrs. Beale addressed her\r\n",
      "announcement, so far as could be judged, equally to Mrs. Wix, who, as\r\n",
      "if from sudden failure of strength, sank into a chair while Maisie\r\n",
      "surrendered to the visitor's embrace. As soon as the child was liberated\r\n",
      "she met with profundity Mrs. Wix's stupefaction and actually was able to\r\n",
      "see that while in a manner sustaining the encounter her face yet seemed\r\n",
      "with intensity to say: \"Now, for God's sake, don't crow 'I told you\r\n",
      "so!'\" Maisie was somehow on the spot aware of an absence of disposition\r\n",
      "to crow; it had taken her but an extra minute to arrive at such a quick\r\n",
      "survey of the objects surrounding Mrs. Beale as showed that among them\r\n",
      "was no appurtenance of Sir Claude's. She knew his dressing-bag now--oh\r\n",
      "with the fondest knowledge!--and there was an instant during which its\r\n",
      "not being there was a stroke of the worst news. She was yet to learn\r\n",
      "what it could be to recognise in some lapse of a sequence the proof of\r\n",
      "an extinction, and therefore remained unaware that this momentary pang\r\n",
      "was a foretaste of the experience of death. It of course yielded in\r\n",
      "a flash to Mrs. Beale's brightness, it gasped itself away in her own\r\n",
      "instant appeal. \"You've come alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Without Sir Claude?\" Strangely, Mrs. Beale looked even brighter. \"Yes;\r\n",
      "in the eagerness to get at you. You abominable little villain!\"--and her\r\n",
      "stepmother, laughing clear, administered to her cheek a pat that was\r\n",
      "partly a pinch. \"What were you up to and what did you take me for? But\r\n",
      "I'm glad to be abroad, and after all it's you who have shown me the way.\r\n",
      "I mightn't, without you, have been able to come--to come, that is, so\r\n",
      "soon. Well, here I am at any rate and in a moment more I should have\r\n",
      "begun to worry about you. This will do very well\"--she was good-natured\r\n",
      "about the place and even presently added that it was charming. Then with\r\n",
      "a rosier glow she made again her great point: \"I'm free, I'm free!\"\r\n",
      "Maisie made on her side her own: she carried back her gaze to Mrs. Wix,\r\n",
      "whom amazement continued to hold; she drew afresh her old friend's\r\n",
      "attention to the superior way she didn't take that up. What she did take\r\n",
      "up the next minute was the question of Sir Claude. \"Where is he? Won't\r\n",
      "he come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale's consideration of this oscillated with a smile between the\r\n",
      "two expectancies with which she was flanked: it was conspicuous, it\r\n",
      "was extraordinary, her unblinking acceptance of Mrs. Wix, a miracle of\r\n",
      "which Maisie had even now begun to read a reflexion in that lady's long\r\n",
      "visage. \"He'll come, but we must MAKE him!\" she gaily brought forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Make him?\" Maisie echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We must give him time. We must play our cards.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But he promised us awfully,\" Maisie replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear child, he has promised ME awfully; I mean lots of things, and\r\n",
      "not in every case kept his promise to the letter.\" Mrs. Beale's good\r\n",
      "humour insisted on taking for granted Mrs. Wix's, to whom her attention\r\n",
      "had suddenly grown prodigious. \"I dare say he has done the same with\r\n",
      "you, and not always come to time. But he makes it up in his own way--and\r\n",
      "it isn't as if we didn't know exactly what he is. There's one thing he\r\n",
      "is,\" she went on, \"which makes everything else only a question, for us,\r\n",
      "of tact.\" They scarce had time to wonder what this was before, as they\r\n",
      "might have said, it flew straight into their face. \"He's as free as I\r\n",
      "am!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I know,\" said Maisie; as if, however, independently weighing the\r\n",
      "value of that. She really weighed also the oddity of her stepmother's\r\n",
      "treating it as news to HER, who had been the first person literally to\r\n",
      "whom Sir Claude had mentioned it. For a few seconds, as if with the\r\n",
      "sound of it in her ears, she stood with him again, in memory and in the\r\n",
      "twilight, in the hotel garden at Folkestone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anything Mrs. Beale overlooked was, she indeed divined, but the effect\r\n",
      "of an exaltation of high spirits, a tendency to soar that showed even\r\n",
      "when she dropped--still quite impartially--almost to the confidential.\r\n",
      "\"Well, then--we've only to wait. He can't do without us long. I'm sure,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix, he can't do without YOU! He's devoted to you; he has told me\r\n",
      "so much about you. The extent I count on you, you know, count on you to\r\n",
      "help me--\" was an extent that even all her radiance couldn't express.\r\n",
      "What it couldn't express quite as much as what it could made at any rate\r\n",
      "every instant her presence and even her famous freedom loom larger; and\r\n",
      "it was this mighty mass that once more led her companions, bewildered\r\n",
      "and disjoined, to exchange with each other as through a thickening veil\r\n",
      "confused and ineffectual signs. They clung together at least on the\r\n",
      "common ground of unpreparedness, and Maisie watched without relief the\r\n",
      "havoc of wonder in Mrs. Wix. It had reduced her to perfect impotence,\r\n",
      "and, but that gloom was black upon her, she sat as if fascinated by Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale's high style. It had plunged her into a long deep hush; for what\r\n",
      "had happened was the thing she had least allowed for and before which\r\n",
      "the particular rigour she had worked up could only grow limp and sick.\r\n",
      "Sir Claude was to have reappeared with his accomplice or without\r\n",
      "her; never, never his accomplice without HIM. Mrs. Beale had gained\r\n",
      "apparently by this time an advantage she could pursue: she looked at the\r\n",
      "droll dumb figure with jesting reproach. \"You really won't shake hands\r\n",
      "with me? Never mind; you'll come round!\" She put the matter to no test,\r\n",
      "going on immediately and, instead of offering her hand, raising it, with\r\n",
      "a pretty gesture that her bent head met, to a long black pin that played\r\n",
      "a part in her back hair. \"Are hats worn at luncheon? If you're as hungry\r\n",
      "as I am we must go right down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix stuck fast, but she met the question in a voice her pupil\r\n",
      "scarce recognised. \"I wear mine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, swallowing at one glance her brand-new bravery, which she\r\n",
      "appeared at once to refer to its origin and to follow in its flights,\r\n",
      "accepted this as conclusive. \"Oh but I've not such a beauty!\" Then she\r\n",
      "turned rejoicingly to Maisie. \"I've got a beauty for YOU my dear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A beauty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A love of a hat--in my luggage. I remembered THAT\"--she nodded at the\r\n",
      "object on her stepdaughter's head--\"and I've brought you one with a\r\n",
      "peacock's breast. It's the most gorgeous blue!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was too strange, this talking with her there already not about\r\n",
      "Sir Claude but about peacocks--too strange for the child to have the\r\n",
      "presence of mind to thank her. But the felicity in which she had arrived\r\n",
      "was so proof against everything that Maisie felt more and more the depth\r\n",
      "of the purpose that must underlie it. She had a vague sense of its being\r\n",
      "abysmal, the spirit with which Mrs. Beale carried off the awkwardness,\r\n",
      "in the white and gold salon, of such a want of breath and of welcome.\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix was more breathless than ever; the embarrassment of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale's isolation was as nothing to the embarrassment of her grace. The\r\n",
      "perception of this dilemma was the germ on the child's part of a new\r\n",
      "question altogether. What if WITH this indulgence--? But the idea lost\r\n",
      "itself in something too frightened for hope and too conjectured for\r\n",
      "fear; and while everything went by leaps and bounds one of the waiters\r\n",
      "stood at the door to remind them that the _table d'hote_ was half over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Had you come up to wash hands?\" Mrs. Beale hereupon asked them. \"Go and\r\n",
      "do it quickly and I'll be with you: they've put my boxes in that nice\r\n",
      "room--it was Sir Claude's. Trust him,\" she laughed, \"to have a nice\r\n",
      "one!\" The door of a neighbouring room stood open, and now from the\r\n",
      "threshold, addressing herself again to Mrs. Wix, she launched a note\r\n",
      "that gave the very key of what, as she would have said, she was up to.\r\n",
      "\"Dear lady, please attend to my daughter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was up to a change of deportment so complete that it represented--oh\r\n",
      "for offices still honourably subordinate if not too explicitly\r\n",
      "menial--an absolute coercion, an interested clutch of the old woman's\r\n",
      "respectability. There was response, to Maisie's view, I may say at once,\r\n",
      "in the jump of that respectability to its feet: it was itself capable of\r\n",
      "one of the leaps, one of the bounds just mentioned, and it carried its\r\n",
      "charge, with this momentum and while Mrs. Beale popped into Sir Claude's\r\n",
      "chamber, straight away to where, at the end of the passage, pupil and\r\n",
      "governess were quartered. The greatest stride of all, for that matter,\r\n",
      "was that within a few seconds the pupil had, in another relation, been\r\n",
      "converted into a daughter. Maisie's eyes were still following it when,\r\n",
      "after the rush, with the door almost slammed and no thought of soap and\r\n",
      "towels, the pair stood face to face. Mrs. Wix, in this position, was the\r\n",
      "first to gasp a sound. \"Can it ever be that SHE has one?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie felt still more bewildered. \"One what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why moral sense.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They spoke as if you might have two, but Mrs. Wix looked as if it were\r\n",
      "not altogether a happy thought, and Maisie didn't see how even an\r\n",
      "affirmative from her own lips would clear up what had become most of a\r\n",
      "mystery. It was to this larger puzzle she sprang pretty straight. \"IS\r\n",
      "she my mother now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a point as to which an horrific glimpse of the responsibility of\r\n",
      "an opinion appeared to affect Mrs. Wix like a blow in the stomach. She\r\n",
      "had evidently never thought of it; but she could think and rebound. \"If\r\n",
      "she is, he's equally your father.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, however, thought further. \"Then my father and my mother--!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she had already faltered and Mrs. Wix had already glared back:\r\n",
      "\"Ought to live together? Don't begin it AGAIN!\" She turned away with\r\n",
      "a groan, to reach the washing-stand, and Maisie could by this time\r\n",
      "recognise with a certain ease that that way verily madness did lie. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix gave a great untidy splash, but the next instant had faced round.\r\n",
      "\"She has taken a new line.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She was nice to you,\" Maisie concurred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What SHE thinks so--'go and dress the young lady!' But it's something!\"\r\n",
      "she panted. Then she thought out the rest. \"If he won't have her, why\r\n",
      "she'll have YOU. She'll be the one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The one to keep me abroad?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The one to give you a home.\" Mrs. Wix saw further; she mastered all the\r\n",
      "portents. \"Oh she's cruelly clever! It's not a moral sense.\" She reached\r\n",
      "her climax: \"It's a game!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A game?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not to lose him. She has sacrificed him--to her duty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then won't he come?\" Maisie pleaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix made no answer; her vision absorbed her. \"He has fought. But\r\n",
      "she has won.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then won't he come?\" the child repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix made it out. \"Yes, hang him!\" She had never been so profane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For all Maisie minded! \"Soon--to-morrow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Too soon--whenever. Indecently soon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But then we SHALL be together!\" the child went on. It made Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "look at her as if in exasperation; but nothing had time to come before\r\n",
      "she precipitated: \"Together with YOU!\" The air of criticism continued,\r\n",
      "but took voice only in her companion's bidding her wash herself and come\r\n",
      "down. The silence of quick ablutions fell upon them, presently broken,\r\n",
      "however, by one of Maisie's sudden reversions. \"Mercy, isn't she\r\n",
      "handsome?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix had finished; she waited. \"She'll attract attention.\" They\r\n",
      "were rapid, and it would have been noticed that the shock the beauty\r\n",
      "had given them acted, incongruously, as a positive spur to their\r\n",
      "preparations for rejoining her. She had none the less, when they\r\n",
      "returned to the sitting-room, already descended; the open door of her\r\n",
      "room showed it empty and the chambermaid explained. Here again they were\r\n",
      "delayed by another sharp thought of Mrs. Wix's. \"But what will she live\r\n",
      "on meanwhile?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie stopped short. \"Till Sir Claude comes?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was nothing to the violence with which her friend had been arrested.\r\n",
      "\"Who'll pay the bills?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie thought. \"Can't SHE?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She? She hasn't a penny.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child wondered. \"But didn't papa--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Leave her a fortune?\" Mrs. Wix would have appeared to speak of papa as\r\n",
      "dead had she not immediately added: \"Why he lives on other women!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh yes, Maisie remembered. \"Then can't he send--\" She faltered again;\r\n",
      "even to herself it sounded queer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Some of their money to his wife?\" Mrs. Wix pave a laugh still stranger\r\n",
      "than the weird suggestion. \"I dare say she'd take it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They hurried on again; yet again, on the stairs, Maisie pulled up.\r\n",
      "\"Well, if she had stopped in England--!\" she threw out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix considered. \"And he had come over instead?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, as we expected.\" Maisie launched her speculation. \"What then would\r\n",
      "she have lived on?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix hung fire but an instant. \"On other men!\" And she marched\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, at table between the pair, plainly attracted the attention\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix had foretold. No other lady present was nearly so handsome,\r\n",
      "nor did the beauty of any other accommodate itself with such art to the\r\n",
      "homage it produced. She talked mainly to her other neighbour, and that\r\n",
      "left Maisie leisure both to note the manner in which eyes were riveted\r\n",
      "and nudges interchanged, and to lose herself in the meanings that, dimly\r\n",
      "as yet and disconnectedly, but with a vividness that fed apprehension,\r\n",
      "she could begin to read into her stepmother's independent move. Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "had helped her by talking of a game; it was a connexion in which the\r\n",
      "move could put on a strategic air. Her notions of diplomacy were thin,\r\n",
      "but it was a kind of cold diplomatic shoulder and an elbow of more than\r\n",
      "usual point that, temporarily at least, were presented to her by the\r\n",
      "averted inclination of Mrs. Beale's head. There was a phrase familiar to\r\n",
      "Maisie, so often was it used by this lady to express the idea of one's\r\n",
      "getting what one wanted: one got it--Mrs. Beale always said SHE at all\r\n",
      "events always got it or proposed to get it--by \"making love.\" She was\r\n",
      "at present making love, singular as it appeared, to Mrs. Wix, and her\r\n",
      "young friend's mind had never moved in such freedom as on thus finding\r\n",
      "itself face to face with the question of what she wanted to get. This\r\n",
      "period of the _omelette aux rognons_ and the poulet saute, while her sole\r\n",
      "surviving parent, her fourth, fairly chattered to her governess, left\r\n",
      "Maisie rather wondering if her governess would hold out. It was strange,\r\n",

      "sense as Mrs. Wix could possibly be in hers: it had risen before her so\r\n",
      "pressingly that this was something new for Mrs. Wix to resist. Resisting\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale herself promised at such a rate to become a very different\r\n",
      "business from resisting Sir Claude's view of her. More might come of\r\n",
      "what had happened--whatever it was--than Maisie felt she could have\r\n",
      "expected. She put it together with a suspicion that, had she ever in\r\n",
      "her life had a sovereign changed, would have resembled an impression,\r\n",
      "baffled by the want of arithmetic, that her change was wrong: she groped\r\n",
      "about in it that she was perhaps playing the passive part in a case of\r\n",

      "\"Well, if she can live with but one of us alone, with which in the world\r\n",
      "should it be but me?\" That answer was far from what, for days, she had\r\n",
      "nursed herself in, and the desolation of it was deepened by the absence\r\n",
      "of anything from Sir Claude to show he had not had to take it as\r\n",
      "triumphant. Had not Mrs. Beale, upstairs, as good as given out that\r\n",
      "she had quitted him with the snap of a tension, left him, dropped him\r\n",
      "in London, after some struggle as a sequel to which her own advent\r\n",
      "represented that she had practically sacrificed him? Maisie assisted in\r\n",
      "fancy at the probable episode in the Regent's Park, finding elements\r\n",
      "almost of terror in the suggestion that Sir Claude had not had fair\r\n",
      "play. They drew something, as she sat there, even from the pride of an\r\n",
      "association with such beauty as Mrs. Beale's; and the child quite forgot\r\n",
      "that, though the sacrifice of Mrs. Beale herself was a solution she had\r\n",
      "not invented, she would probably have seen Sir Claude embark upon it\r\n",
      "without a direct remonstrance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What her stepmother had clearly now promised herself to wring from Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix was an assent to the great modification, the change, as smart as a\r\n",
      "juggler's trick, in the interest of which nothing so much mattered as\r\n",
      "the new convenience of Mrs. Beale. Maisie could positively seize the\r\n",
      "moral that her elbow seemed to point in ribs thinly defended--the moral\r\n",
      "of its not mattering a straw which of the step-parents was the guardian.\r\n",
      "The essence of the question was that a girl wasn't a boy: if Maisie had\r\n",
      "been a mere rough trousered thing, destined at the best probably to grow\r\n",
      "up a scamp, Sir Claude would have been welcome. As the case stood he had\r\n",
      "simply tumbled out of it, and Mrs. Wix would henceforth find herself in\r\n",
      "the employ of the right person. These arguments had really fallen into\r\n",
      "their place, for our young friend, at the very touch of that tone in\r\n",
      "which she had heard her new title declared. She was still, as a result\r\n",
      "of so many parents, a daughter to somebody even after papa and mamma\r\n",
      "were to all intents dead. If her father's wife and her mother's husband,\r\n",
      "by the operation of a natural or, for all she knew, a legal rule, were\r\n",
      "in the shoes of their defunct partners, then Mrs. Beale's partner was\r\n",
      "exactly as defunct as Sir Claude's and her shoes the very pair to which,\r\n",
      "in \"Farange _v._ Farange and Others,\" the divorce court had given\r\n",
      "priority. The subject of that celebrated settlement saw the rest of\r\n",
      "her day really filled out with the pomp of all that Mrs. Beale assumed.\r\n",
      "The assumption rounded itself there between this lady's entertainers,\r\n",
      "flourished in a way that left them, in their bottomless element, scarce\r\n",
      "a free pair of eyes to exchange signals. It struck Maisie even a little\r\n",
      "that there was a rope or two Mrs. Wix might have thrown out if she\r\n",
      "would, a rocket or two she might have sent up. They had at any rate\r\n",
      "never been so long together without communion or telegraphy, and their\r\n",
      "companion kept them apart by simply keeping them with her. From this\r\n",
      "situation they saw the grandeur of their intenser relation to her pass\r\n",
      "and pass like an endless procession. It was a day of lively movement\r\n",
      "and of talk on Mrs. Beale's part so brilliant and overflowing as to\r\n",
      "represent music and banners. She took them out with her promptly to walk\r\n",
      "and to drive, and even--towards night--sketched a plan for carrying them\r\n",
      "to the Etablissement, where, for only a franc apiece, they should listen\r\n",
      "to a concert of celebrities. It reminded Maisie, the plan, of the\r\n",
      "side-shows at Earl's Court, and the franc sounded brighter than the\r\n",
      "shillings which had at that time failed; yet this too, like the other,\r\n",
      "was a frustrated hope: the francs failed like the shillings and the\r\n",
      "side-shows had set an example to the concert. The Etablissement in short\r\n",
      "melted away, and it was little wonder that a lady who from the moment of\r\n",
      "her arrival had been so gallantly in the breach should confess herself\r\n",
      "it last done up. Maisie could appreciate her fatigue; the day had not\r\n",
      "passed without such an observer's discovering that she was excited and\r\n",
      "even mentally comparing her state to that of the breakers after a gale.\r\n",
      "It had blown hard in London, and she would take time to go down. It was\r\n",
      "of the condition known to the child by report as that of talking against\r\n",
      "time that her emphasis, her spirit, her humour, which had never dropped,\r\n",
      "now gave the impression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She too was delighted with foreign manners; but her daughter's\r\n",
      "opportunities of explaining them to her were unexpectedly forestalled\r\n",
      "by her own tone of large acquaintance with them. One of the things that\r\n",
      "nipped in the bud all response to her volubility was Maisie's surprised\r\n",
      "retreat before the fact that Continental life was what she had been\r\n",
      "almost brought up on. It was Mrs. Beale, disconcertingly, who began to\r\n",
      "explain it to her friends; it was she who, wherever they turned, was the\r\n",
      "interpreter, the historian and the guide. She was full of reference to\r\n",
      "her early travels--at the age of eighteen: she had at that period made,\r\n",
      "with a distinguished Dutch family, a stay on the Lake of Geneva. Maisie\r\n",
      "had in the old days been regaled with anecdotes of these adventures,\r\n",
      "but they had with time become phantasmal, and the heroine's quite showy\r\n",
      "exemption from bewilderment at Boulogne, her acuteness on some of the\r\n",
      "very subjects on which Maisie had been acute to Mrs. Wix, were a high\r\n",
      "note of the majesty, of the variety of advantage, with which she had\r\n",
      "alighted. It was all a part of the wind in her sails and of the weight\r\n",
      "with which her daughter was now to feel her hand. The effect of it on\r\n",
      "Maisie was to add already the burden of time to her separation from Sir\r\n",
      "Claude. This might, to her sense, have lasted for days; it was as if,\r\n",
      "with their main agitation transferred thus to France and with neither\r\n",
      "mamma now nor Mrs. Beale nor Mrs. Wix nor herself at his side, he must\r\n",
      "be fearfully alone in England. Hour after hour she felt as if she were\r\n",
      "waiting; yet she couldn't have said exactly for what. There were moments\r\n",
      "when Mrs. Beale's flow of talk was a mere rattle to smother a knock.\r\n",
      "At no part of the crisis had the rattle so public a purpose as when,\r\n",
      "instead of letting Maisie go with Mrs. Wix to prepare for dinner, she\r\n",
      "pushed her--with a push at last incontestably maternal--straight into\r\n",
      "the room inherited from Sir Claude. She titivated her little charge with\r\n",
      "her own brisk hands; then she brought out: \"I'm going to divorce your\r\n",
      "father.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was so different from anything Maisie had expected that it took\r\n",
      "some time to reach her mind. She was aware meanwhile that she probably\r\n",
      "looked rather wan. \"To marry Sir Claude?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale rewarded her with a kiss. \"It's sweet to hear you put it so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a tribute, but it left Maisie balancing for an objection. \"How\r\n",
      "CAN you when he's married?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He isn't--practically. He's free, you know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Free to marry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Free, first, to divorce his own fiend.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The benefit that, these last days, she had felt she owed a certain\r\n",
      "person left Maisie a moment so ill-prepared for recognising this lurid\r\n",
      "label that she hesitated long enough to risk: \"Mamma?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She isn't your mamma any longer,\" Mrs. Beale returned. \"Sir Claude has\r\n",
      "paid her money to cease to be.\" Then as if remembering how little, to\r\n",
      "the child, a pecuniary transaction must represent: \"She lets him off\r\n",
      "supporting her if he'll let her off supporting you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale appeared, however, to have done injustice to her daughter's\r\n",
      "financial grasp. \"And support me himself?\" Maisie asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Take the whole bother and burden of you and never let her hear of you\r\n",
      "again. It's a regular signed contract.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why that's lovely of her!\" Maisie cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's not so lovely, my dear, but that he'll get his divorce.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie was briefly silent; after which, \"No--he won't get it,\" she said.\r\n",
      "Then she added still more boldly: \"And you won't get yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, who was at the dressing-glass, turned round with amusement\r\n",
      "and surprise. \"How do you know that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know!\" cried Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From Mrs. Wix?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie debated, then after an instant took her cue from Mrs. Beale's\r\n",
      "absence of anger, which struck her the more as she had felt how much of\r\n",
      "her courage she needed. \"From Mrs. Wix,\" she admitted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, at the glass again, made play with a powder-puff. \"My own\r\n",
      "sweet, she's mistaken!\" was all she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a certain force in the very amenity of this, but our young\r\n",
      "lady reflected long enough to remember that it was not the answer Sir\r\n",
      "Claude himself had made. The recollection nevertheless failed to prevent\r\n",
      "her saying: \"Do you mean then that he won't come till he has got it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale gave a last touch; she was ready; she stood there in all her\r\n",
      "elegance. \"I mean, my dear, that it's because he HASN'T got it that I\r\n",
      "left him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This opened a view that stretched further than Maisie could reach. She\r\n",
      "turned away from it, but she spoke before they went out again. \"Do you\r\n",
      "like Mrs. Wix now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, my chick, I was just going to ask you if you think she has come at\r\n",
      "all to like poor bad me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie thought, at this hint; but unsuccessfully. \"I haven't the least\r\n",
      "idea. But I'll find out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do!\" said Mrs. Beale, rustling out with her in a scented air and as if\r\n",
      "it would be a very particular favour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child tried promptly at bed-time, relieved now of the fear that\r\n",
      "their visitor would wish to separate her for the night from her\r\n",
      "attendant. \"Have you held out?\" she began as soon as the two doors at\r\n",
      "the end of the passage were again closed on them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix looked hard at the flame of the candle. \"Held out--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, she has been making love to you. Has she won you over?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix transferred her intensity to her pupil's face. \"Over to what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To HER keeping me instead.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Instead of Sir Claude?\" Mrs. Wix was distinctly gaining time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; who else? since it's not instead of you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix coloured at this lucidity. \"Yes, that IS what she means.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, do you like it?\" Maisie asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She actually had to wait, for oh her friend was embarrassed! \"My\r\n",
      "opposition to the connexion--theirs--would then naturally to some extent\r\n",
      "fall. She has treated me to-day as if I weren't after all quite such a\r\n",
      "worm; not that I don't know very well where she got the pattern of her\r\n",
      "politeness. But of course,\" Mrs. Wix hastened to add, \"I shouldn't like\r\n",
      "her as THE one nearly so well as him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Nearly so well!'\" Maisie echoed. \"I should hope indeed not.\" She spoke\r\n",
      "with a firmness under which she was herself the first to quiver. \"I\r\n",
      "thought you 'adored' him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do,\" Mrs. Wix sturdily allowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then have you suddenly begun to adore her too?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix, instead of directly answering, only blinked in support of her\r\n",
      "sturdiness. \"My dear, in what a tone you ask that! You're coming out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why shouldn't I? YOU'VE come out. Mrs. Beale has come out. We each have\r\n",
      "our turn!\" And Maisie threw off the most extraordinary little laugh that\r\n",
      "had ever passed her young lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There passed Mrs. Wix's indeed the next moment a sound that more than\r\n",
      "matched it. \"You're most remarkable!\" she neighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her pupil, though wholly without aspirations to pertness, barely\r\n",
      "faltered. \"I think you've done a great deal to make me so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very true, I have.\" She dropped to humility, as if she recalled her so\r\n",
      "recent self-arraignment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Would you accept her then? That's what I ask,\" said Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As a substitute?\" Mrs. Wix turned it over; she met again the child's\r\n",
      "eyes. \"She has literally almost fawned upon me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She hasn't fawned upon HIM. She hasn't even been kind to him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix looked as if she had now an advantage. \"Then do you propose to\r\n",
      "'kill' her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't answer my question,\" Maisie persisted. \"I want to know if you\r\n",
      "accept her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix continued to hedge. \"I want to know if YOU do!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything in the child's person, at this, announced that it was easy to\r\n",
      "know. \"Not for a moment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not the two now?\" Mrs. Wix had caught on; she flushed with it. \"Only\r\n",
      "him alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Him alone or nobody.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not even ME?\" cried Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her sleep was drawn out, she instantly recognised lateness in the way\r\n",
      "her eyes opened to Mrs. Wix, erect, completely dressed, more dressed\r\n",
      "than ever, and gazing at her from the centre of the room. The next thing\r\n",
      "she was sitting straight up, wide awake with the fear of the hours of\r\n",
      "\"abroad\" that she might have lost. Mrs. Wix looked as if the day had\r\n",
      "already made itself felt, and the process of catching up with it began\r\n",
      "for Maisie in hearing her distinctly say: \"My poor dear, he has come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir Claude?\" Maisie, clearing the little bed-rug with the width of her\r\n",
      "spring, felt the polished floor under her bare feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He crossed in the night; he got in early.\" Mrs. Wix's head jerked\r\n",
      "stiffly backward. \"He's there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you've seen him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. He's there--he's there,\" Mrs. Wix repeated. Her voice came out with\r\n",
      "a queer extinction that was not a voluntary drop, and she trembled so\r\n",
      "that it added to their common emotion. Visibly pale, they gazed at each\r\n",
      "other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't it too BEAUTIFUL?\" Maisie panted back at her; a challenge with an\r\n",
      "answer to which, however, she was not ready at once. The term Maisie had\r\n",
      "used was a flash of diplomacy--to prevent at any rate Mrs. Wix's using\r\n",
      "another. To that degree it was successful; there was only an appeal,\r\n",
      "strange and mute, in the white old face, which produced the effect of\r\n",
      "a want of decision greater than could by any stretch of optimism have\r\n",
      "been associated with her attitude toward what had happened. For Maisie\r\n",
      "herself indeed what had happened was oddly, as she could feel, less of a\r\n",
      "simple rapture than any arrival or return of the same supreme friend had\r\n",
      "ever been before. What had become overnight, what had become while she\r\n",
      "slept, of the comfortable faculty of gladness? She tried to wake it up a\r\n",
      "little wider by talking, by rejoicing, by plunging into water and into\r\n",
      "clothes, and she made out that it was ten o'clock, but also that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix had not yet breakfasted. The day before, at nine, they had had\r\n",
      "together a _cafe complet_ in their sitting-room. Mrs. Wix on her side\r\n",
      "had evidently also a refuge to seek. She sought it in checking the\r\n",
      "precipitation of some of her pupil's present steps, in recalling to her\r\n",
      "with an approach to sternness that of such preliminaries those embodied\r\n",
      "in a thorough use of soap should be the most thorough, and in throwing\r\n",
      "even a certain reprobation on the idea of hurrying into clothes for\r\n",
      "the sake of a mere stepfather. She took her in hand with a silent\r\n",
      "insistence; she reduced the process to sequences more definite than any\r\n",
      "it had known since the days of Moddle. Whatever it might be that had\r\n",
      "now, with a difference, begun to belong to Sir Claude's presence was\r\n",
      "still after all compatible, for our young lady, with the instinct of\r\n",
      "dressing to see him with almost untidy haste. Mrs. Wix meanwhile luckily\r\n",
      "was not wholly directed to repression. \"He's there--he's there!\" she\r\n",
      "had said over several times. It was her answer to every invitation\r\n",
      "to mention how long she had been up and her motive for respecting so\r\n",
      "rigidly the slumber of her companion. It formed for some minutes her\r\n",
      "only account of the whereabouts of the others and her reason for not\r\n",
      "having yet seen them, as well as of the possibility of their presently\r\n",
      "being found in the salon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's there--he's there!\" she declared once more as she made, on the\r\n",
      "child, with an almost invidious tug, a strained undergarment \"meet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean he's in the salon?\" Maisie asked again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's WITH her,\" Mrs. Wix desolately said. \"He's with her,\" she\r\n",
      "reiterated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean in her own room?\" Maisie continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She waited an instant. \"God knows!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie wondered a little why, or how, God should know; this, however,\r\n",
      "delayed but an instant her bringing out: \"Well, won't she go back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go back? Never!\"\r\n",

      "\"She'll stay all the same?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All the more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then won't Sir Claude go?\" Maisie asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go back--if SHE doesn't?\" Mrs. Wix appeared to give this question the\r\n",
      "benefit of a minute's thought. \"Why should he have come--only to go\r\n",
      "back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie produced an ingenious solution. \"To MAKE her go. To take her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix met it without a concession. \"If he can make her go so easily,\r\n",
      "why should he have let her come?\"\r\n",

      "\"Yes--she has a right.\"\r\n",

      "\"Besides,\" Maisie went on, \"he didn't let her come. He doesn't like her\r\n",
      "coming, and if he doesn't like it--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix took her up. \"He must lump it--that's what he must do! Your\r\n",
      "mother was right about him--I mean your real one. He has no strength.\r\n",
      "No--none at all.\" She seemed more profoundly to muse. \"He might have\r\n",
      "had some even with HER--I mean with her ladyship. He's just a poor sunk\r\n",
      "slave,\" she asserted with sudden energy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie wondered again. \"A slave?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To his passions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "on: \"But how do you know he'll stay?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because he likes us!\"--and Mrs. Wix, with her emphasis of the word,\r\n",
      "whirled her charge round again to deal with posterior hooks. She had\r\n",
      "positively never shaken her so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was as if she quite shook something out of her. \"But how will that\r\n",
      "help him if we--in spite of his liking!--don't stay?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean if we go off and leave him with her?--\" Mrs. Wix put the\r\n",
      "question to the back of her pupil's head. \"It WON'T help him. It will be\r\n",
      "his ruin. He'll have got nothing. He'll have lost everything. It will be\r\n",
      "his utter destruction, for he's certain after a while to loathe her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then when he loathes her\"--it was astonishing how she caught the\r\n",
      "idea--\"he'll just come right after us!\" Maisie announced.\r\n",

      "\"Never.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"That won't matter. She won't loathe HIM. People don't!\" Mrs. Wix\r\n",
      "brought up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Some do. Mamma does,\" Maisie contended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mamma does NOT!\" It was startling--her friend contradicted her flat.\r\n",
      "\"She loves him--she adores him. A woman knows.\" Mrs. Wix spoke not only\r\n",
      "as if Maisie were not a woman, but as if she would never be one. \"_I_\r\n",
      "know!\" she cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why on earth has she left him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix hesitated. \"He hates HER. Don't stoop so--lift up your hair.\r\n",
      "You know how I'm affected toward him,\" she added with dignity; \"but\r\n",
      "you must also know that I see clear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie all this time was trying hard to do likewise. \"Then if she has\r\n",
      "left him for that why shouldn't Mrs. Beale leave him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because she's not such a fool!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not such a fool as mamma?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Precisely--if you WILL have it. Does it look like her leaving him?\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix enquired. She brooded again; then she went on with more\r\n",
      "intensity: \"Do you want to know really and truly why? So that she may\r\n",
      "be his wretchedness and his punishment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His punishment?\"--this was more than as yet Maisie could quite accept.\r\n",
      "\"For what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For everything. That's what will happen: he'll be tied to her for ever.\r\n",
      "She won't mind in the least his hating her, and she won't hate him back.\r\n",
      "She'll only hate US.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Us?\" the child faintly echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll hate YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Me? Why, I brought them together!\" Maisie resentfully cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You brought them together.\" There was a completeness in Mrs. Wix's\r\n",
      "assent. \"Yes; it was a pretty job. Sit down.\" She began to brush her\r\n",
      "pupil's hair and, as she took up the mass of it with some force of\r\n",
      "hand, went on with a sharp recall: \"Your mother adored him at first--it\r\n",
      "might have lasted. But he began too soon with Mrs. Beale. As you say,\"\r\n",
      "she pursued with a brisk application of the brush, \"you brought them\r\n",
      "together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I brought them together\"--Maisie was ready to reaffirm it. She felt\r\n",
      "none the less for a moment at the bottom of a hole; then she seemed to\r\n",
      "see a way out. \"But I didn't bring mamma together--\" She just faltered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With all those gentlemen?\"--Mrs. Wix pulled her up. \"No; it isn't quite\r\n",
      "so bad as that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I only said to the Captain\"--Maisie had the quick memory of it--\"that\r\n",
      "I hoped he at least (he was awfully nice!) would love her and keep her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And even that wasn't much harm,\" threw in Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It wasn't much good,\" Maisie was obliged to recognise. \"She can't bear\r\n",
      "him--not even a mite. She told me at Folkestone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix suppressed a gasp; then after a bridling instant during\r\n",
      "which she might have appeared to deflect with difficulty from her odd\r\n",
      "consideration of Ida's wrongs: \"He was a nice sort of person for her to\r\n",
      "talk to you about!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I LIKE him!\" Maisie promptly rejoined; and at this, with an\r\n",
      "inarticulate sound and an inconsequence still more marked, her companion\r\n",
      "bent over and dealt her on the cheek a rapid peck which had the apparent\r\n",
      "intention of a kiss.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, if her ladyship doesn't agree with you, what does it only prove?\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix demanded in conclusion. \"It proves that she's fond of Sir\r\n",
      "Claude!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, in the light of some of the evidence, reflected on that till her\r\n",
      "hair was finished, but when she at last started up she gave a sign of no\r\n",
      "very close embrace of it. She grasped at this moment Mrs. Wix's arm. \"He\r\n",
      "must have got his divorce!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Since day before yesterday? Don't talk trash.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was spoken with an impatience which left the child nothing to\r\n",
      "reply; whereupon she sought her defence in a completely different\r\n",
      "relation to the fact. \"Well, I knew he would come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So did I; but not in twenty-four hours. I gave him a few days!\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix wailed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, whom she had now released, looked at her with interest. \"How\r\n",
      "many did SHE give him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix faced her a moment; then as if with a bewildered sniff: \"You\r\n",
      "had better ask her!\" But she had no sooner uttered the words than she\r\n",
      "caught herself up. \"Lord o' mercy, how we talk!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie felt that however they talked she must see him, but she said\r\n",
      "nothing more for a time, a time during which she conscientiously\r\n",
      "finished dressing and Mrs. Wix also kept silence. It was as if they each\r\n",
      "had almost too much to think of, and even as if the child had the sense\r\n",
      "that her friend was watching her and seeing if she herself were watched.\r\n",
      "At last Mrs. Wix turned to the window and stood--sightlessly, as Maisie\r\n",
      "could guess--looking away. Then our young lady, before the glass, gave\r\n",
      "the supreme shake. \"Well, I'm ready. And now to SEE him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix turned round, but as if without having heard her. \"It's\r\n",
      "tremendously grave.\" There were slow still tears behind the\r\n",
      "straighteners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is--it is.\" Maisie spoke as if she were now dressed quite up to the\r\n",
      "occasion; as if indeed with the last touch she had put on the\r\n",
      "judgement-cap. \"I must see him immediately.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can you see him if he doesn't send for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why can't I go and find him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because you don't know where he is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can't I just look in the salon?\" That still seemed simple to Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix, however, instantly cut it off. \"I wouldn't have you look in\r\n",
      "the salon for all the world!\" Then she explained a little: \"The salon\r\n",
      "isn't ours now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ours?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yours and mine. It's theirs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Theirs?\" Maisie, with her stare, continued to echo. \"You mean they want\r\n",
      "to keep us out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix faltered; she sank into a chair and, as Maisie had often enough\r\n",
      "seen her do before, covered her face with her hands. \"They ought to, at\r\n",
      "least. The situation's too monstrous!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie stood there a moment--she looked about the room. \"I'll go to\r\n",
      "him--I'll find him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_I_ won't! I won't go NEAR them!\" cried Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I'll see him alone.\" The child spied what she had been looking\r\n",
      "for--she possessed herself of her hat. \"Perhaps I'll take him out!\" And\r\n",
      "with decision she quitted the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When she entered the salon it was empty, but at the sound of the opened\r\n",
      "door some one stirred on the balcony, and Sir Claude, stepping straight\r\n",
      "in, stood before her. He was in light fresh clothes and wore a straw hat\r\n",
      "with a bright ribbon; these things, besides striking her in themselves\r\n",
      "as the very promise of the grandest of grand tours, gave him a certain\r\n",
      "radiance and, as it were, a tropical ease; but such an effect only\r\n",
      "marked rather more his having stopped short and, for a longer minute\r\n",
      "than had ever at such a juncture elapsed, not opened his arms to her.\r\n",
      "His pause made her pause and enabled her to reflect that he must have\r\n",
      "been up some time, for there were no traces of breakfast; and that\r\n",
      "though it was so late he had rather markedly not caused her to be called\r\n",
      "to him. Had Mrs. Wix been right about their forfeiture of the salon? Was\r\n",
      "it all his now, all his and Mrs. Beale's? Such an idea, at the rate her\r\n",
      "small thoughts throbbed, could only remind her of the way in which what\r\n",
      "had been hers hitherto was what was exactly most Mrs. Beale's and his.\r\n",
      "It was strange to be standing there and greeting him across a gulf,\r\n",
      "for he had by this time spoken, smiled and said: \"My dear child, my\r\n",
      "dear child!\" but without coming any nearer. In a flash she saw he was\r\n",
      "different--more so than he knew or designed. The next minute indeed it\r\n",
      "was as if he caught an impression from her face: this made him hold out\r\n",
      "his hand. Then they met, he kissed her, he laughed, she thought he even\r\n",
      "blushed: something of his affection rang out as usual. \"Here I am, you\r\n",
      "see, again--as I promised you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not as he had promised them--he had not promised them Mrs. Beale;\r\n",
      "but Maisie said nothing about that. What she said was simply: \"I knew\r\n",
      "you had come. Mrs. Wix told me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes. And where is she?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In her room. She got me up--she dressed me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked at her up and down; a sweetness of mockery that she\r\n",
      "particularly loved came out in his face whenever he did that, and it\r\n",
      "was not wanting now. He raised his eyebrows and his arms to play at\r\n",
      "admiration; he was evidently after all disposed to be gay. \"Got you\r\n",
      "up?--I should think so! She has dressed you most beautifully. Isn't she\r\n",
      "coming?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie wondered if she had better tell. \"She said not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doesn't she want to see a poor devil?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked about under the vibration of the way he described himself,\r\n",
      "and her eyes rested on the door of the room he had previously occupied.\r\n",
      "\"Is Mrs. Beale in there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked blankly at the same object. \"I haven't the least\r\n",
      "idea!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You haven't seen her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not the tip of her nose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie thought: there settled on her, in the light of his beautiful\r\n",
      "smiling eyes, the faintest purest coldest conviction that he wasn't\r\n",
      "telling the truth. \"She hasn't welcomed you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not by a single sign.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then where is she?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude laughed; he seemed both amused and surprised at the point\r\n",
      "she made of it. \"I give it up!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doesn't she know you've come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed again. \"Perhaps she doesn't care!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, with an inspiration, pounced on his arm. \"Has she GONE?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He met her eyes and then she could see that his own were really much\r\n",
      "graver than his manner. \"Gone?\" She had flown to the door, but before\r\n",
      "she could raise her hand to knock he was beside her and had caught it.\r\n",
      "\"Let her be. I don't care about her. I want to see YOU.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then she HASN'T gone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie fell back with him. He still looked as if it were a joke, but the\r\n",
      "more she saw of him the more she could make out that he was troubled.\r\n",
      "\"It wouldn't be like her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stood wondering at him. \"Did you want her to come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can you suppose--?\" He put it to her candidly. \"We had an immense\r\n",
      "row over it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean you've quarrelled?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude was at a loss. \"What has she told you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I'm hers as much as yours. That she represents papa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His gaze struck away through the open window and up to the sky; she\r\n",
      "could hear him rattle in his trousers-pockets his money or his keys.\r\n",
      "\"Yes--that's what she keeps saying.\" It gave him for a moment an air\r\n",
      "that was almost helpless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You say you don't care about her,\" Maisie went on. \"DO you mean you've\r\n",
      "quarrelled?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We do nothing in life but quarrel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rose before her, as he said this, so soft and fair, so rich, in spite\r\n",
      "of what might worry him, in restored familiarities, that it gave a\r\n",
      "bright blur to the meaning--to what would otherwise perhaps have been\r\n",
      "the palpable promise--of the words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I assure you hers are quite fearful!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't speak of hers. I speak of yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah don't do it till I've had my coffee! You're growing up clever,\" he\r\n",
      "added. Then he said: \"I suppose you've breakfasted?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no--I've had nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing in your room?\"--he was all compunction. \"My dear old\r\n",

      "\"You ARE clever! We'll go to a cafe.\" Maisie was already at the door; he\r\n",
      "glanced round the room. \"A moment--my stick.\" But there appeared to be\r\n",
      "no stick. \"No matter; I left it--oh!\" He remembered with an odd drop and\r\n",
      "came out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You left it in London?\" she asked as they went downstairs.\r\n",

      "Wix?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie's face just showed a shadow. \"Do you want her to come?\"\r\n",

      "\"Dear no--I want to see you alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's the way I want to see YOU!\" she replied. \"Like before.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I'll send it up to her. Madame!\" He had already, at the foot of\r\n",
      "the stair, called out to the stout _patronne_, a lady who turned to\r\n",
      "him from the bustling, breezy hall a countenance covered with fresh\r\n",
      "matutinal powder and a bosom as capacious as the velvet shelf of a\r\n",
      "chimneypiece, over which her round white face, framed in its golden\r\n",
      "frizzle, might have figured as a showy clock. He ordered, with\r\n",
      "particular recommendations, Mrs. Wix's repast, and it was a charm to\r\n",
      "hear his easy brilliant French: even his companion's ignorance could\r\n",
      "measure the perfection of it. The _patronne_, rubbing her hands and\r\n",
      "breaking in with high swift notes as into a florid duet, went with him\r\n",
      "to the street, and while they talked a moment longer Maisie remembered\r\n",
      "what Mrs. Wix had said about every one's liking him. It came out enough\r\n",
      "through the morning powder, it came out enough in the heaving bosom, how\r\n",
      "the landlady liked him. He had evidently ordered something lovely for\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix. _\"Et bien soigne, n'est-ce-pas?\"_\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_\"Soyez tranquille\"_--the patronne beamed upon him. _\"Et pour Madame?\"_\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_\"Madame?\"_ he echoed--it just pulled him up a little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_\"Rien encore?\"_\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Rien encore._ Come, Maisie.\" She hurried along with him, but on the way\r\n",

      "the hotel, but further along the quay; with wide, clear windows and a\r\n",
      "floor sprinkled with bran in a manner that gave it for Maisie something\r\n",
      "of the added charm of a circus. They had pretty much to themselves the\r\n",
      "painted spaces and the red plush benches; these were shared by a few\r\n",
      "scattered gentlemen who picked teeth, with facial contortions, behind\r\n",
      "little bare tables, and by an old personage in particular, a very old\r\n",
      "personage with a red ribbon in his buttonhole, whose manner of soaking\r\n",
      "buttered rolls in coffee and then disposing of them in the little that\r\n",
      "was left of the interval between his nose and chin might at a less\r\n",
      "anxious hour have cast upon Maisie an almost envious spell. They too\r\n",

      "Claude's asking her if she could with that light aid wait till the hour\r\n",
      "of dejeuner. His allusion to this meal gave her, in the shaded sprinkled\r\n",
      "coolness, the scene, as she vaguely felt, of a sort of ordered mirrored\r\n",
      "licence, the haunt of those--the irregular, like herself--who went to\r\n",
      "bed or who rose too late, something to think over while she watched\r\n",
      "the white-aproned waiter perform as nimbly with plates and saucers as\r\n",
      "a certain conjurer her friend had in London taken her to a music-hall\r\n",
      "to see. Sir Claude had presently begun to talk again, to tell her how\r\n",
      "London had looked and how long he had felt himself, on either side, to\r\n",
      "have been absent; all about Susan Ash too and the amusement as well as\r\n",
      "the difficulty he had had with her; then all about his return journey\r\n",
      "and the Channel in the night and the crowd of people coming over and\r\n",
      "the way there were always too many one knew. He spoke of other matters\r\n",
      "beside, especially of what she must tell him of the occupations, while\r\n",
      "he was away, of Mrs. Wix and her pupil. Hadn't they had the good time he\r\n",
      "had promised?--had he exaggerated a bit the arrangements made for their\r\n",
      "pleasure? Maisie had something--not all there was--to say of his success\r\n",
      "and of their gratitude: she had a complication of thought that grew\r\n",
      "every minute, grew with the consciousness that she had never seen him in\r\n",
      "this particular state in which he had been given back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix had once said--it was once or fifty times; once was enough for\r\n",
      "Maisie, but more was not too much--that he was wonderfully various.\r\n",
      "Well, he was certainly so, to the child's mind, on the present occasion:\r\n",
      "he was much more various than he was anything else. Besides, the fact\r\n",
      "that they were together in a shop, at a nice little intimate table as\r\n",
      "they had so often been in London, only made greater the difference of\r\n",
      "what they were together about. This difference was in his face, in his\r\n",
      "voice, in every look he gave her and every movement he made. They were\r\n",
      "not the looks and the movements he really wanted to show, and she could\r\n",
      "feel as well that they were not those she herself wanted. She had\r\n",
      "seen him nervous, she had seen every one she had come in contact with\r\n",
      "nervous, but she had never seen him so nervous as this. Little by little\r\n",
      "it gave her a settled terror, a terror that partook of the coldness she\r\n",
      "had felt just before, at the hotel, to find herself, on his answer about\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, disbelieve him. She seemed to see at present, to touch\r\n",
      "across the table, as if by laying her hand on it, what he had meant when\r\n",
      "he confessed on those several occasions to fear. Why was such a man so\r\n",
      "often afraid? It must have begun to come to her now that there was one\r\n",
      "thing just such a man above all could be afraid of. He could be afraid\r\n",
      "of himself. His fear at all events was there; his fear was sweet to her,\r\n",
      "beautiful and tender to her, was having coffee and buttered rolls and\r\n",
      "talk and laughter that were no talk and laughter at all with her; his\r\n",
      "fear was in his jesting postponing perverting voice; it was just in\r\n",
      "this make-believe way he had brought her out to imitate the old London\r\n",
      "playtimes, to imitate indeed a relation that had wholly changed, a\r\n",
      "relation that she had with her very eyes seen in the act of change when,\r\n",
      "the day before in the salon, Mrs. Beale rose suddenly before her. She\r\n",
      "rose before her, for that matter, now, and even while their refreshment\r\n",
      "delayed Maisie arrived at the straight question for which, on their\r\n",
      "entrance, his first word had given opportunity. \"Are we going to have\r\n",
      "dejeuner with Mrs. Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His reply was anything but straight. \"You and I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie sat back in her chair. \"Mrs. Wix and me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude also shifted. \"That's an enquiry, my dear child, that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale herself must answer.\" Yes, he had shifted; but abruptly, after a\r\n",
      "moment during which something seemed to hang there between them and, as\r\n",
      "it heavily swayed, just fan them with the air of its motion, she felt\r\n",
      "that the whole thing was upon them. \"Do you mind,\" he broke out, \"my\r\n",
      "asking you what Mrs. Wix has said to you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Said to me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This day or two--while I was away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean about you and Mrs. Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, resting on his elbows, fixed his eyes a moment on the white\r\n",
      "marble beneath them. \"No; I think we had a good deal of that--didn't\r\n",
      "we?--before I left you. It seems to me we had it pretty well all out. I\r\n",
      "mean about yourself, about your--don't you know?--associating with us,\r\n",
      "as I might say, and staying on with us. While you were alone with our\r\n",
      "friend what did she say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie felt the weight of the question; it kept her silent for a space\r\n",
      "during which she looked at Sir Claude, whose eyes remained bent.\r\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" she returned at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He showed incredulity. \"Nothing?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" Maisie repeated; on which an interruption descended in the\r\n",
      "form of a tray bearing the preparations for their breakfast. These\r\n",
      "preparations were as amusing as everything else; the waiter poured their\r\n",
      "coffee from a vessel like a watering-pot and then made it froth with the\r\n",
      "curved stream of hot milk that dropped from the height of his raised\r\n",
      "arm; but the two looked across at each other through the whole play of\r\n",
      "French pleasantness with a gravity that had now ceased to dissemble.\r\n",
      "Sir Claude sent the waiter off again for something and then took up her\r\n",
      "answer. \"Hasn't she tried to affect you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Face to face with him thus it seemed to Maisie that she had tried so\r\n",
      "little as to be scarce worth mentioning; again therefore an instant she\r\n",
      "shut herself up. Presently she found her middle course. \"Mrs. Beale\r\n",
      "likes her now; and there's one thing I've found out--a great thing.\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix enjoys her being so kind. She was tremendously kind all day\r\n",
      "yesterday.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see. And what did she do?\" Sir Claude asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie was now busy with her breakfast, and her companion attacked his\r\n",
      "own; so that it was all, in form at least, even more than their old\r\n",
      "sociability. \"Everything she could think of. She was as nice to her as\r\n",
      "you are,\" the child said. \"She talked to her all day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what did she say to her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't know.\" Maisie was a little bewildered with his pressing her\r\n",
      "so for knowledge; it didn't fit into the degree of intimacy with Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale that Mrs. Wix had so denounced and that, according to that lady,\r\n",
      "had now brought him back in bondage. Wasn't he more aware than his\r\n",
      "stepdaughter of what would be done by the person to whom he was bound?\r\n",
      "In a moment, however, she added: \"She made love to her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked at her harder, and it was clearly something in her\r\n",
      "tone that made him quickly say: \"You don't mind my asking you, do you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not at all; only I should think you'd know better than I.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What Mrs. Beale did yesterday?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought he coloured a trifle; but almost simultaneously with that\r\n",
      "impression she found herself answering: \"Yes--if you have seen her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He broke into the loudest of laughs. \"Why, my dear boy, I told you just\r\n",
      "now I've absolutely not. I say, don't you believe me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was something she was already so afraid of that it covered up\r\n",
      "other fears. \"Didn't you come back to see her?\" she enquired in a\r\n",
      "moment. \"Didn't you come back because you always want to so much?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He received her enquiry as he had received her doubt--with an\r\n",
      "extraordinary absence of resentment. \"I can imagine of course why you\r\n",
      "think that. But it doesn't explain my doing what I have. It was, as I\r\n",
      "said to you just now at the inn, really and truly you I wanted to see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She felt an instant as she used to feel when, in the back garden at her\r\n",
      "mother's, she took from him the highest push of a swing--high, high,\r\n",
      "high--that he had had put there for her pleasure and that had finally\r\n",
      "broken down under the weight and the extravagant patronage of the cook.\r\n",
      "\"Well, that's beautiful. But to see me, you mean, and go away again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My going away again is just the point. I can't tell yet--it all\r\n",
      "depends.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On Mrs. Beale?\" Maisie asked. \"SHE won't go away.\" He finished emptying\r\n",
      "his coffee-cup and then, when he had put it down, leaned back in his\r\n",
      "chair, where she could see that he smiled on her. This only added to her\r\n",
      "idea that he was in trouble, that he was turning somehow in his pain and\r\n",
      "trying different things. He continued to smile and she went on: \"Don't\r\n",
      "you know that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I may as well confess to you that as much as that I do know. SHE\r\n",
      "won't go away. She'll stay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll stay. She'll stay,\" Maisie repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just so. Won't you have some more coffee?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And another buttered roll?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He signed to the hovering waiter, who arrived with the shining spout of\r\n",
      "plenty in either hand and with the friendliest interest in mademoiselle.\r\n",
      "_\"Les tartines sont la.\"_ Their cups were replenished and, while he\r\n",
      "watched almost musingly the bubbles in the fragrant mixture, \"Just\r\n",
      "so--just so,\" Sir Claude said again and again. \"It's awfully awkward!\"\r\n",
      "he exclaimed when the waiter had gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That she won't go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--everything! Well, well, well!\" But he pulled himself together;\r\n",
      "he began again to eat. \"I came back to ask you something. That's what\r\n",
      "I came back for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know what you want to ask me,\" Maisie said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you very sure?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm ALMOST very.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then risk it. You mustn't make ME risk everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was struck with the force of this. \"You want to know if I should be\r\n",
      "happy with THEM.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With those two ladies only? No, no, old man: _vous n'y etes pas_. So\r\n",
      "now--there!\" Sir Claude laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then what is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next minute, instead of telling her what it was, he laid his hand\r\n",
      "across the table on her own and held her as if under the prompting of a\r\n",
      "thought. \"Mrs. Wix would stay with HER?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Without you? Oh yes--now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On account, as you just intimated, of Mrs. Beale's changed manner?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, with her sense of responsibility, weighed both Mrs. Beale's\r\n",
      "changed manner and Mrs. Wix's human weakness. \"I think she talked her\r\n",
      "round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude thought a moment. \"Ah poor dear!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean Mrs. Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no--Mrs. Wix.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She likes being talked round--treated like any one else. Oh she likes\r\n",
      "great politeness,\" Maisie expatiated. \"It affects her very much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude, to her surprise, demurred a little to this. \"Very much--up\r\n",
      "to a certain point.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh up to any point!\" Maisie returned with emphasis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, haven't I been polite to her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lovely--and she perfectly worships you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then, my dear child, why can't she let me alone?\"--this time Sir\r\n",
      "Claude unmistakeably blushed. Before Maisie, however, could answer his\r\n",
      "question, which would indeed have taken her long, he went on in another\r\n",
      "tone: \"Mrs. Beale thinks she has probably quite broken her down. But she\r\n",
      "hasn't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though he spoke as if he were sure, Maisie was strong in the impression\r\n",
      "she had just uttered and that she now again produced. \"She has talked\r\n",
      "her round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah yes; round to herself, but not round to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh she couldn't bear to hear him say that! \"To you? Don't you really\r\n",
      "believe how she loves you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude examined his belief. \"Of course I know she's wonderful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's just every bit as fond of you as _I_ am,\" said Maisie. \"She told\r\n",
      "me so yesterday.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah then,\" he promptly exclaimed, \"she HAS tried to affect you! I don't\r\n",
      "love HER, don't you see? I do her perfect justice,\" he pursued, \"but I\r\n",
      "mean I don't love her as I do you, and I'm sure you wouldn't seriously\r\n",
      "expect it. She's not my daughter--come, old chap! She's not even my\r\n",
      "mother, though I dare say it would have been better for me if she had\r\n",
      "been. I'll do for her what I'd do for my mother, but I won't do more.\"\r\n",
      "His real excitement broke out in a need to explain and justify himself,\r\n",
      "though he kept trying to correct and conceal it with laughs and\r\n",
      "mouthfuls and other vain familiarities. Suddenly he broke off, wiping\r\n",
      "his moustache with sharp pulls and coming back to Mrs. Beale. \"Did she\r\n",
      "try to talk YOU over?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--to me she said very little. Very little indeed,\" Maisie continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude seemed struck with this. \"She was only sweet to Mrs. Wix?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As sweet as sugar!\" cried Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked amused at her comparison, but he didn't contest it; he uttered\r\n",
      "on the contrary, in an assenting way, a little inarticulate sound. \"I\r\n",
      "know what she CAN be. But much good may it have done her! Mrs. Wix won't\r\n",
      "COME 'round.' That's what makes it so fearfully awkward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie knew it was fearfully awkward; she had known this now, she felt,\r\n",
      "for some time, and there was something else it more pressingly concerned\r\n",
      "her to learn. \"What is it you meant you came over to ask me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Sir Claude, \"I was just going to say. Let me tell you it\r\n",
      "will surprise you.\" She had finished breakfast now and she sat back in\r\n",
      "her chair again: she waited in silence to hear. He had pushed the things\r\n",
      "before him a little way and had his elbows on the table. This time, she\r\n",
      "was convinced, she knew what was coming, and once more, for the crash,\r\n",
      "as with Mrs. Wix lately in her room, she held her breath and drew\r\n",
      "together her eyelids. He was going to say she must give him up. He\r\n",
      "looked hard at her again; then he made his effort. \"Should you see your\r\n",
      "way to let her go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was bewildered. \"To let who--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Wix simply. I put it at the worst. Should you see your way to\r\n",
      "sacrifice her? Of course I know what I'm asking.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie's eyes opened wide again; this was so different from what she had\r\n",
      "expected. \"And stay with you alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave another push to his coffee-cup. \"With me and Mrs. Beale. Of\r\n",
      "course it would be rather rum; but everything in our whole story is\r\n",
      "rather rum, you know. What's more unusual than for any one to be given\r\n",
      "up, like you, by her parents?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh nothing is more unusual than THAT!\" Maisie concurred, relieved at\r\n",
      "the contact of a proposition as to which concurrence could have\r\n",
      "lucidity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course it would be quite unconventional,\" Sir Claude went on--\"I\r\n",
      "mean the little household we three should make together; but things have\r\n",
      "got beyond that, don't you see? They got beyond that long ago. We shall\r\n",
      "stay abroad at any rate--it's ever so much easier and it's our affair\r\n",
      "and nobody else's: it's no one's business but ours on all the blessed\r\n",
      "earth. I don't say that for Mrs. Wix, poor dear--I do her absolute\r\n",
      "justice. I respect her; I see what she means; she has done me a lot of\r\n",
      "good. But there are the facts. There they are, simply. And here am I,\r\n",
      "and here are you. And she won't come round. She's right from her point\r\n",
      "of view. I'm talking to you in the most extraordinary way--I'm always\r\n",
      "talking to you in the most extraordinary way, ain't I? One would think\r\n",
      "you were about sixty and that I--I don't know what any one would think\r\n",
      "_I_ am. Unless a beastly cad!\" he suggested. \"I've been awfully worried,\r\n",
      "and this's what it has come to. You've done us the most tremendous good,\r\n",
      "and you'll do it still and always, don't you see? We can't let you\r\n",
      "go--you're everything. There are the facts as I say. She IS your mother\r\n",
      "now, Mrs. Beale, by what has happened, and I, in the same way, I'm your\r\n",
      "father. No one can contradict that, and we can't get out of it. My idea\r\n",
      "would be a nice little place--somewhere in the South--where she and you\r\n",
      "would be together and as good as any one else. And I should be as good\r\n",
      "too, don't you see? for I shouldn't live with you, but I should be close\r\n",
      "to you--just round the corner, and it would be just the same. My idea\r\n",

      "She smiled dimly; she saw what he meant. \"It isn't so very very much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's so very very little,\" he returned, \"that that's a thing we've\r\n",
      "positively to consider. We probably shouldn't give you another\r\n",
      "governess. To begin with we shouldn't be able to get one--not of the\r\n",
      "only kind that would do. It wouldn't do--the kind that WOULD do,\" he\r\n",
      "queerly enough explained. \"I mean they wouldn't stay--heigh-ho! We'd\r\n",
      "do you ourselves. Particularly me. You see I CAN now; I haven't got to\r\n",
      "mind--what I used to. I won't fight shy as I did--she can show out WITH\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It seemed wonderfully regular, the way he put it; yet none the less,\r\n",
      "while she looked at it as judiciously as she could, the picture it made\r\n",
      "persisted somehow in being a combination quite distinct--an old woman\r\n",
      "and a little girl seated in deep silence on a battered old bench by the\r\n",
      "rampart of the _haute ville_. It was just at that hour yesterday; they\r\n",
      "were hand in hand; they had melted together. \"I don't think you yet\r\n",
      "understand how she clings to you,\" Maisie said at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do--I do. But for all that--\" And he gave, turning in his conscious\r\n",
      "exposure, an oppressed impatient sigh; the sigh, even his companion\r\n",
      "could recognise, of the man naturally accustomed to that argument, the\r\n",
      "man who wanted thoroughly to be reasonable, but who, if really he had to\r\n",
      "mind so many things, would be always impossibly hampered. What it came\r\n",
      "to indeed was that he understood quite perfectly. If Mrs. Wix clung it\r\n",
      "was all the more reason for shaking Mrs. Wix off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This vision of what she had brought him to occupied our young lady\r\n",
      "while, to ask what he owed, he called the waiter and put down a gold\r\n",
      "piece that the man carried off for change. Sir Claude looked after him,\r\n",
      "then went on: \"How could a woman have less to reproach a fellow with? I\r\n",
      "mean as regards herself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie entertained the question. \"Yes. How COULD she have less? So why\r\n",
      "are you so sure she'll go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Surely you heard why--you heard her come out three nights ago? How can\r\n",
      "she do anything but go--after what she then said? I've done what she\r\n",
      "warned me of--she was absolutely right. So here we are. Her liking Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale, as you call it now, is a motive sufficient, with other things,\r\n",
      "to make her, for your sake, stay on without me; it's not a motive\r\n",
      "sufficient to make her, even for yours, stay on WITH me--swallow, don't\r\n",
      "you see? what she can't swallow. And when you say she's as fond of me as\r\n",
      "you are I think I can, if that's the case, challenge you a little on it.\r\n",
      "Would YOU, only with those two, stay on without me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The waiter came back with the change, and that gave her, under this\r\n",
      "appeal, a moment's respite. But when he had retreated again with the\r\n",
      "\"tip\" gathered in with graceful thanks on a subtle hint from Sir\r\n",
      "Claude's forefinger, the latter, while pocketing the money, followed\r\n",
      "the appeal up. \"Would you let her make you live with Mrs. Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Without you? Never,\" Maisie then answered. \"Never,\" she said again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It made him quite triumph, and she was indeed herself shaken by the mere\r\n",
      "sound of it. \"So you see you're not, like her,\" he exclaimed, \"so ready\r\n",
      "to give me away!\" Then he came back to his original question. \"CAN you\r\n",
      "choose? I mean can you settle it by a word yourself? Will you stay on\r\n",
      "with us without her?\" Now in truth she felt the coldness of her terror,\r\n",
      "and it seemed to her that suddenly she knew, as she knew it about Sir\r\n",
      "Claude, what she was afraid of. She was afraid of herself. She looked at\r\n",
      "him in such a way that it brought, she could see, wonder into his face,\r\n",
      "a wonder held in check, however, by his frank pretension to play fair\r\n",
      "with her, not to use advantages, not to hurry nor hustle her--only to\r\n",
      "put her chance clearly and kindly before her. \"May I think?\" she finally\r\n",
      "asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, certainly. But how long?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh only a little while,\" she said meekly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had for a moment the air of wishing to look at it as if it were the\r\n",
      "most cheerful prospect in the world. \"But what shall we do while you're\r\n",
      "thinking?\" He spoke as if thought were compatible with almost any\r\n",
      "distraction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was but one thing Maisie wished to do, and after an instant she\r\n",
      "expressed it. \"Have we got to go back to the hotel?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you want to?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's not the least necessity for it.\" He bent his eyes on his watch;\r\n",
      "his face was now very grave. \"We can do anything else in the world.\" He\r\n",
      "looked at her again almost as if he were on the point of saying that\r\n",
      "they might for instance start off for Paris. But even while she wondered\r\n",
      "if that were not coming he had a sudden drop. \"We can take a walk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was all ready, but he sat there as if he had still something more to\r\n",
      "say. This too, however, didn't come; so she herself spoke. \"I think I\r\n",
      "should like to see Mrs. Wix first.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Before you decide? All right--all right.\" He had put on his hat, but\r\n",
      "he had still to light a cigarette. He smoked a minute, with his head\r\n",
      "thrown back, looking at the ceiling; then he said: \"There's one thing\r\n",
      "to remember--I've a right to impress it on you: we stand absolutely in\r\n",
      "the place of your parents. It's their defection, their extraordinary\r\n",
      "baseness, that has made our responsibility. Never was a young person\r\n",
      "more directly committed and confided.\" He appeared to say this over, at\r\n",
      "the ceiling, through his smoke, a little for his own illumination. It\r\n",
      "carried him after a pause somewhat further. \"Though I admit it was to\r\n",
      "each of us separately.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave her so at that moment and in that attitude the sense of wanting,\r\n",
      "as it were, to be on her side--on the side of what would be in every way\r\n",
      "most right and wise and charming for her--that she felt a sudden desire\r\n",
      "to prove herself not less delicate and magnanimous, not less solicitous\r\n",
      "for his own interests. What were these but that of the \"regularity\"\r\n",
      "he had just before spoken of? \"It WAS to each of you separately,\" she\r\n",
      "accordingly with much earnestness remarked. \"But don't you remember? I\r\n",
      "brought you together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He jumped up with a delighted laugh. \"Remember? Rather! You brought us\r\n",
      "together, you brought us together. Come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XXXI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She remained out with him for a time of which she could take no measure\r\n",
      "save that it was too short for what she wished to make of it--an\r\n",
      "interval, a barrier indefinite, insurmountable. They walked about, they\r\n",
      "dawdled, they looked in shop-windows; they did all the old things\r\n",
      "exactly as if to try to get back all the old safety, to get something\r\n",
      "out of them that they had always got before. This had come before,\r\n",
      "whatever it was, without their trying, and nothing came now but the\r\n",
      "intenser consciousness of their quest and their subterfuge. The\r\n",
      "strangest thing of all was what had really happened to the old safety.\r\n",
      "What had really happened was that Sir Claude was \"free\" and that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale was \"free,\" and yet that the new medium was somehow still more\r\n",
      "oppressive than the old. She could feel that Sir Claude concurred with\r\n",
      "her in the sense that the oppression would be worst at the inn, where,\r\n",
      "till something should be settled, they would feel the want of\r\n",
      "something--of what could they call it but a footing? The question of the\r\n",
      "settlement loomed larger to her now: it depended, she had learned, so\r\n",
      "completely on herself. Her choice, as her friend had called it, was\r\n",
      "there before her like an impossible sum on a slate, a sum that in spite\r\n",
      "of her plea for consideration she simply got off from doing while she\r\n",
      "walked about with him. She must see Mrs. Wix before she could do her\r\n",
      "sum; therefore the longer before she saw her the more distant would be\r\n",
      "the ordeal. She met at present no demand whatever of her obligation; she\r\n",
      "simply plunged, to avoid it, deeper into the company of Sir Claude. She\r\n",
      "saw nothing that she had seen hitherto--no touch in the foreign picture\r\n",
      "that had at first been always before her. The only touch was that of Sir\r\n",
      "Claude's hand, and to feel her own in it was her mute resistance to\r\n",
      "time. She went about as sightlessly as if he had been leading her\r\n",
      "blindfold. If they were afraid of themselves it was themselves they\r\n",
      "would find at the inn. She was certain now that what awaited them there\r\n",
      "would be to lunch with Mrs. Beale. All her instinct was to avoid that,\r\n",
      "to draw out their walk, to find pretexts, to take him down upon the\r\n",
      "beach, to take him to the end of the pier. He said no other word to her\r\n",
      "about what they had talked of at breakfast, and she had a dim vision of\r\n",
      "how his way of not letting her see him definitely wait for anything from\r\n",
      "her would make any one who should know of it, would make Mrs. Wix for\r\n",
      "instance, think him more than ever a gentleman. It was true that once or\r\n",
      "twice, on the jetty, on the sands, he looked at her for a minute with\r\n",
      "eyes that seemed to propose to her to come straight off with him to\r\n",
      "Paris. That, however, was not to give her a nudge about her\r\n",
      "responsibility. He evidently wanted to procrastinate quite as much as\r\n",
      "she did; he was not a bit more in a hurry to get back to the others.\r\n",
      "Maisie herself at this moment could be secretly merciless to Mrs. Wix--\r\n",
      "to the extent at any rate of not caring if her continued disappearance\r\n",
      "did make that lady begin to worry about what had become of her, even\r\n",
      "begin to wonder perhaps if the truants hadn't found their remedy. Her\r\n",
      "want of mercy to Mrs. Beale indeed was at least as great; for Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale's worry and wonder would be as much greater as the object at which\r\n",
      "they were directed. When at last Sir Claude, at the far end of the\r\n",
      "_plage_, which they had already, in the many-coloured crowd, once\r\n",
      "traversed, suddenly, with a look at his watch, remarked that it was\r\n",
      "time, not to get back to the _table d'hote_, but to get over to the\r\n",
      "station and meet the Paris papers--when he did this she found herself\r\n",
      "thinking quite with intensity what Mrs. Beale and Mrs. Wix WOULD say. On\r\n",
      "the way over to the station she had even a mental picture of the\r\n",
      "stepfather and the pupil established in a little place in the South\r\n",
      "while the governess and the stepmother, in a little place in the North,\r\n",
      "remained linked by a community of blankness and by the endless series of\r\n",
      "remarks it would give birth to. The Paris papers had come in and her\r\n",
      "companion, with a strange extravagance, purchased no fewer than eleven:\r\n",
      "it took up time while they hovered at the bookstall on the restless\r\n",
      "platform, where the little volumes in a row were all yellow and pink and\r\n",
      "one of her favourite old women in one of her favourite old caps\r\n",
      "absolutely wheedled him into the purchase of three. They had thus so\r\n",
      "much to carry home that it would have seemed simpler, with such a\r\n",
      "provision for a nice straight journey through France, just to \"nip,\" as\r\n",
      "she phrased it to herself, into the coupe of the train that, a little\r\n",
      "further along, stood waiting to start. She asked Sir Claude where it was\r\n",
      "going.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Paris. Fancy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She could fancy well enough. They stood there and smiled, he with all\r\n",
      "the newspapers under his arm and she with the three books, one yellow\r\n",
      "and two pink. He had told her the pink were for herself and the yellow\r\n",
      "one for Mrs. Beale, implying in an interesting way that these were the\r\n",
      "natural divisions in France of literature for the young and for the old.\r\n",
      "She knew how prepared they looked to pass into the train, and she\r\n",
      "presently brought out to her companion: \"I wish we could go. Won't you\r\n",
      "take me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He continued to smile. \"Would you really come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, oh yes. Try.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you want me to take our tickets?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, take them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Without any luggage?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She showed their two armfuls, smiling at him as he smiled at her, but so\r\n",
      "conscious of being more frightened than she had ever been in her life\r\n",
      "that she seemed to see her whiteness as in a glass. Then she knew that\r\n",
      "what she saw was Sir Claude's whiteness: he was as frightened as\r\n",
      "herself. \"Haven't we got plenty of luggage?\" she asked. \"Take the\r\n",
      "tickets--haven't you time? When does the train go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude turned to a porter. \"When does the train go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man looked up at the station-clock. \"In two minutes. _Monsieur est\r\n",
      "place?_\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_\"Pas encore.\"_\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_\"Et vos billets?--vous n'avez que le temps.\"_ Then after a look at\r\n",
      "Maisie, _\"Monsieur veut-il que je les prenne?\"_ the man said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude turned back to her. _\"Veux-tu lieu qu'il en prenne?\"_\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the most extraordinary thing in the world: in the intensity of\r\n",
      "her excitement she not only by illumination understood all their French,\r\n",
      "but fell into it with an active perfection. She addressed herself\r\n",
      "straight to the porter. _\"Prenny, prenny. Oh prenny!\"_\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_\"Ah si mademoiselle le veut--!\"_ He waited there for the money.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Sir Claude only stared--stared at her with his white face. \"You HAVE\r\n",
      "chosen then? You'll let her go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie carried her eyes wistfully to the train, where, amid cries of\r\n",
      "_\"En voiture, en voiture!\"_ heads were at windows and doors banging\r\n",
      "loud. The porter was pressing. _\"Ah vous n'avez plus le temps!\"_\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's going--it's going!\" cried Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They watched it move, they watched it start; then the man went his way\r\n",
      "with a shrug. \"It's gone!\" Sir Claude said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie crept some distance up the platform; she stood there with her\r\n",
      "back to her companion, following it with her eyes, keeping down tears,\r\n",
      "nursing her pink and yellow books. She had had a real fright but had\r\n",
      "fallen back to earth. The odd thing was that in her fall her fear too\r\n",
      "had been dashed down and broken. It was gone. She looked round at last,\r\n",
      "from where she had paused, at Sir Claude's, and then saw that his\r\n",
      "wasn't. It sat there with him on the bench to which, against the wall of\r\n",
      "the station, he had retreated, and where, leaning back and, as she\r\n",
      "thought, rather queer, he still waited. She came down to him and he\r\n",
      "continued to offer his ineffectual intention of pleasantry. \"Yes, I've\r\n",
      "chosen,\" she said to him. \"I'll let her go if you--if you--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She faltered; he quickly took her up. \"If I, if I--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you'll give up Mrs. Beale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" he exclaimed; on which she saw how much, how hopelessly he was\r\n",
      "afraid. She had supposed at the cafe that it was of his rebellion, of\r\n",
      "his gathering motive; but how could that be when his temptations--that\r\n",
      "temptation for example of the train they had just lost--were after all\r\n",
      "so slight? Mrs. Wix was right. He was afraid of his weakness--of his\r\n",
      "weakness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She couldn't have told you afterwards how they got back to the inn: she\r\n",
      "could only have told you that even from this point they had not gone\r\n",
      "straight, but once more had wandered and loitered and, in the course of\r\n",
      "it, had found themselves on the edge of the quay where--still apparently\r\n",
      "with half an hour to spare--the boat prepared for Folkestone was drawn\r\n",
      "up. Here they hovered as they had done at the station; here they\r\n",
      "exchanged silences again, but only exchanged silences. There were\r\n",
      "punctual people on the deck, choosing places, taking the best; some of\r\n",
      "them already contented, all established and shawled, facing to England\r\n",
      "and attended by the steward, who, confined on such a day to the lighter\r\n",
      "offices, tucked up the ladies' feet or opened bottles with a pop. They\r\n",
      "looked down at these things without a word; they even picked out a good\r\n",
      "place for two that was left in the lee of a lifeboat; and if they\r\n",
      "lingered rather stupidly, neither deciding to go aboard nor deciding to\r\n",
      "come away, it was Sir Claude quite as much as she who wouldn't move. It\r\n",
      "was Sir Claude who cultivated the supreme stillness by which she knew\r\n",
      "best what he meant. He simply meant that he knew all she herself meant.\r\n",
      "But there was no pretence of pleasantry now: their faces were grave and\r\n",
      "tired. When at last they lounged off it was as if his fear, his fear of\r\n",
      "his weakness, leaned upon her heavily as they followed the harbour. In\r\n",
      "the hall of the hotel as they passed in she saw a battered old box that\r\n",
      "she recognised, an ancient receptacle with dangling labels that she knew\r\n",
      "and a big painted W, lately done over and intensely personal, that\r\n",
      "seemed to stare at her with a recognition and even with some suspicion\r\n",
      "of its own. Sir Claude caught it too, and there was agitation for both\r\n",
      "of them in the sight of this object on the move. Was Mrs. Wix going and\r\n",
      "was the responsibility of giving her up lifted, at a touch, from her\r\n",
      "pupil? Her pupil and her pupil's companion, transfixed a moment, held,\r\n",
      "in the presence of the omen, communication more intense than in the\r\n",
      "presence either of the Paris train or of the Channel steamer; then, and\r\n",
      "still without a word, they went straight upstairs. There, however, on\r\n",
      "the landing, out of sight of the people below, they collapsed so that\r\n",
      "they had to sink down together for support: they simply seated\r\n",
      "themselves on the uppermost step while Sir Claude grasped the hand of\r\n",
      "his stepdaughter with a pressure that at another moment would probably\r\n",
      "have made her squeal. Their books and papers were all scattered. \"She\r\n",
      "thinks you've given her up!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I must see her--I must see her,\" Maisie said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To bid her good-bye?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I must see her--I must see her,\" the child only repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They sat a minute longer, Sir Claude, with his tight grip of her hand\r\n",
      "and looking away from her, looking straight down the staircase to where,\r\n",
      "round the turn, electric bells rattled and the pleasant sea-draught\r\n",
      "blew. At last, loosening his grasp, he slowly got up while she did the\r\n",
      "same. They went together along the lobby, but before they reached the\r\n",
      "salon he stopped again. \"If I give up Mrs. Beale--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll go straight out with you again and not come back till she has\r\n",
      "gone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed to wonder. \"Till Mrs. Beale--?\" He had made it sound like a\r\n",
      "bad joke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean till Mrs. Wix leaves--in that boat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked almost foolish. \"Is she going in that boat?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I suppose so. I won't even bid her good-bye,\" Maisie continued. \"I'll\r\n",
      "stay out till the boat has gone. I'll go up to the old rampart.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The old rampart?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll sit on that old bench where you see the gold Virgin.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The gold Virgin?\" he vaguely echoed. But it brought his eyes back to\r\n",
      "her as if after an instant he could see the place and the thing she\r\n",
      "named--could see her sitting there alone. \"While I break with Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"While you break with Mrs. Beale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave a long deep smothered sigh. \"I must see her first.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You won't do as I do? Go out and wait?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wait?\"--once more he appeared at a loss.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Till they both have gone,\" Maisie said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Giving US up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Giving US up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh with what a face for an instant he wondered if that could be! But his\r\n",
      "wonder the next moment only made him go to the door and, with his hand\r\n",
      "on the knob, stand as if listening for voices. Maisie listened, but she\r\n",
      "heard none. All she heard presently was Sir Claude's saying with\r\n",
      "speculation quite choked off, but so as not to be heard in the salon:\r\n",
      "\"Mrs. Beale will never go.\" On this he pushed open the door and she went\r\n",
      "in with him. The salon was empty, but as an effect of their entrance the\r\n",
      "lady he had just mentioned appeared at the door of the bedroom. \"Is she\r\n",
      "going?\" he then demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale came forward, closing her door behind her. \"I've had the most\r\n",
      "extraordinary scene with her. She told me yesterday she'd stay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And my arrival has altered it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh we took that into account!\" Mrs. Beale was flushed, which was never\r\n",
      "quite becoming to her, and her face visibly testified to the encounter\r\n",
      "to which she alluded. Evidently, however, she had not been worsted, and\r\n",
      "she held up her head and smiled and rubbed her hands as if in sudden\r\n",
      "emulation of the _patronne_. \"She promised she'd stay even if you should\r\n",
      "come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why has she changed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because she's a hound. The reason she herself gives is that you've been\r\n",
      "out too long.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude stared. \"What has that to do with it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've been out an age,\" Mrs. Beale continued; \"I myself couldn't\r\n",
      "imagine what had become of you. The whole morning,\" she exclaimed, \"and\r\n",
      "luncheon long since over!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude appeared indifferent to that. \"Did Mrs. Wix go down with\r\n",
      "you?\" he only asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not she; she never budged!\"--and Mrs. Beale's flush, to Maisie's\r\n",
      "vision, deepened. \"She moped there--she didn't so much as come out to\r\n",
      "me; and when I sent to invite her she simply declined to appear. She\r\n",
      "said she wanted nothing, and I went down alone. But when I came up,\r\n",
      "fortunately a little primed\"--and Mrs. Beale smiled a fine smile of\r\n",
      "battle--\"she WAS in the field!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you had a big row?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We had a big row\"--she assented with a frankness as large. \"And while\r\n",
      "you left me to that sort of thing I should like to know where you were!\"\r\n",
      "She paused for a reply, but Sir Claude merely looked at Maisie; a\r\n",
      "movement that promptly quickened her challenge. \"Where the mischief have\r\n",
      "you been?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You seem to take it as hard as Mrs. Wix,\" Sir Claude returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I take it as I choose to take it, and you don't answer my question.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked again at Maisie--as if for an aid to this effort; whereupon\r\n",
      "she smiled at her stepmother and offered: \"We've been everywhere.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, however, made her no response, thereby adding to a surprise\r\n",
      "of which our young lady had already felt the light brush. She had\r\n",
      "received neither a greeting nor a glance, but perhaps this was not more\r\n",
      "remarkable than the omission, in respect to Sir Claude, parted with in\r\n",
      "London two days before, of any sign of a sense of their reunion. Most\r\n",
      "remarkable of all was Mrs. Beale's announcement of the pledge given by\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix and not hitherto revealed to her pupil. Instead of heeding this\r\n",
      "witness she went on with acerbity: \"It might surely have occurred to you\r\n",
      "that something would come up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude looked at his watch. \"I had no idea it was so late, nor that\r\n",
      "we had been out so long. We weren't hungry. It passed like a flash. What\r\n",
      "HAS come up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh that she's disgusted,\" said Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With whom then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With Maisie.\" Even now she never looked at the child, who stood there\r\n",
      "equally associated and disconnected. \"For having no moral sense.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How SHOULD she have?\" Sir Claude tried again to shine a little at the\r\n",
      "companion of his walk. \"How at any rate is it proved by her going out\r\n",
      "with me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't ask ME; ask that woman. She drivels when she doesn't rage,\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And she leaves the child?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She leaves the child,\" said Mrs. Beale with great emphasis and looking\r\n",
      "more than ever over Maisie's head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this position suddenly a change came into her face, caused, as the\r\n",
      "others could the next thing see, by the reappearance of Mrs. Wix in the\r\n",
      "doorway which, on coming in at Sir Claude's heels, Maisie had left\r\n",
      "gaping. \"I DON'T leave the child--I don't, I don't!\" she thundered from\r\n",
      "the threshold, advancing upon the opposed three but addressing herself\r\n",
      "directly to Maisie. She was girded--positively harnessed--for departure,\r\n",
      "arrayed as she had been arrayed on her advent and armed with a small fat\r\n",
      "rusty reticule which, almost in the manner of a battle-axe, she\r\n",
      "brandished in support of her words. She had clearly come straight from\r\n",
      "her room, where Maisie in an instant guessed she had directed the\r\n",
      "removal of her minor effects. \"I don't leave you till I've given you\r\n",
      "another chance. Will you come WITH me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie turned to Sir Claude, who struck her as having been removed to a\r\n",
      "distance of about a mile. To Mrs. Beale she turned no more than Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale had turned: she felt as if already their difference had been\r\n",
      "disclosed. What had come out about that in the scene between the two\r\n",
      "women? Enough came out now, at all events, as she put it practically to\r\n",
      "her stepfather. \"Will YOU come? Won't you?\" she enquired as if she had\r\n",
      "not already seen that she should have to give him up. It was the last\r\n",
      "flare of her dream. By this time she was afraid of nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should think you'd be too proud to ask!\" Mrs. Wix interposed. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix was herself conspicuously too proud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at the child's words Mrs. Beale had fairly bounded. \"Come away from\r\n",
      "ME, Maisie?\" It was a wail of dismay and reproach, in which her\r\n",
      "stepdaughter was astonished to read that she had had no hostile\r\n",
      "consciousness and that if she had been so actively grand it was not from\r\n",
      "suspicion, but from strange entanglements of modesty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude presented to Mrs. Beale an expression positively sick. \"Don't\r\n",
      "put it to her THAT way!\" There had indeed been something in Mrs. Beale's\r\n",
      "tone, and for a moment our young lady was reminded of the old days in\r\n",
      "which so many of her friends had been \"compromised.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This friend blushed; she was before Mrs. Wix, and though she bridled she\r\n",
      "took the hint. \"No--it isn't the way.\" Then she showed she knew the way.\r\n",
      "\"Don't be a still bigger fool, dear, but go straight to your room and\r\n",
      "wait there till I can come to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie made no motion to obey, but Mrs. Wix raised a hand that\r\n",
      "forestalled every evasion. \"Don't move till you've heard me. I'M going,\r\n",
      "but I must first understand. Have you lost it again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie surveyed--for the idea of a describable loss--the immensity of\r\n",
      "space. Then she replied lamely enough: \"I feel as if I had lost\r\n",
      "everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix looked dark. \"Do you mean to say you HAVE lost what we found\r\n",
      "together with so much difficulty two days ago?\" As her pupil failed of\r\n",
      "response she continued: \"Do you mean to say you've already forgotten\r\n",
      "what we found together?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie dimly remembered. \"My moral sense?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your moral sense. HAVEN'T I, after all, brought it out?\" She spoke as\r\n",
      "she had never spoken even in the schoolroom and with the book in her\r\n",
      "hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It brought back to the child's recollection how she sometimes couldn't\r\n",
      "repeat on Friday the sentence that had been glib on Wednesday, and she\r\n",
      "dealt all feebly and ruefully with the present tough passage. Sir Claude\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Beale stood there like visitors at an \"exam.\" She had indeed an\r\n",
      "instant a whiff of the faint flower that Mrs. Wix pretended to have\r\n",
      "plucked and now with such a peremptory hand thrust at her nose. Then it\r\n",
      "left her, and, as if she were sinking with a slip from a foothold, her\r\n",
      "arms made a short jerk. What this jerk represented was the spasm within\r\n",
      "her of something still deeper than a moral sense. She looked at her\r\n",
      "examiner; she looked at the visitors; she felt the rising of the tears\r\n",
      "she had kept down at the station. They had nothing--no, distinctly\r\n",
      "nothing--to do with her moral sense. The only thing was the old flat\r\n",
      "shameful schoolroom plea. \"I don't know--I don't know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you've lost it.\" Mrs. Wix seemed to close the book as she fixed\r\n",
      "the straighteners on Sir Claude. \"You've nipped it in the bud. You've\r\n",
      "killed it when it had begun to live.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was a newer Mrs. Wix than ever, a Mrs. Wix high and great; but Sir\r\n",
      "Claude was not after all to be treated as a little boy with a missed\r\n",
      "lesson. \"I've not killed anything,\" he said; \"on the contrary I think\r\n",
      "I've produced life. I don't know what to call it--I haven't even known\r\n",
      "how decently to deal with it, to approach it; but, whatever it is, it's\r\n",
      "the most beautiful thing I've ever met--it's exquisite, it's sacred.\" He\r\n",
      "had his hands in his pockets and, though a trace of the sickness he had\r\n",
      "just shown perhaps lingered there, his face bent itself with\r\n",
      "extraordinary gentleness on both the friends he was about to lose. \"Do\r\n",
      "you know what I came back for?\" he asked of the elder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think I do!\" cried Mrs. Wix, surprisingly un-mollified and with the\r\n",
      "heat of her late engagement with Mrs. Beale still on her brow. That\r\n",
      "lady, as if a little besprinkled by such turns of the tide, uttered a\r\n",
      "loud inarticulate protest and, averting herself, stood a moment at the\r\n",
      "window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I came back with a proposal,\" said Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To me?\" Mrs. Wix asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Maisie. That she should give you up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And does she?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude wavered. \"Tell her!\" he then exclaimed to the child, also\r\n",
      "turning away as if to give her the chance. But Mrs. Wix and her pupil\r\n",
      "stood confronted in silence, Maisie whiter than ever--more awkward,\r\n",
      "more rigid and yet more dumb. They looked at each other hard, and as\r\n",
      "nothing came from them Sir Claude faced about again. \"You won't tell\r\n",
      "her?--you can't?\" Still she said nothing; whereupon, addressing Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix, he broke into a kind of ecstasy. \"She refused--she refused!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, at this, found her voice. \"I didn't refuse. I didn't,\" she\r\n",
      "repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It brought Mrs. Beale straight back to her. \"You accepted, angel--you\r\n",
      "accepted!\" She threw herself upon the child and, before Maisie could\r\n",
      "resist, had sunk with her upon the sofa, possessed of her, encircling\r\n",
      "her. \"You've given her up already, you've given her up for ever, and\r\n",
      "you're ours and ours only now, and the sooner she's off the better!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie had shut her eyes, but at a word of Sir Claude's they opened.\r\n",
      "\"Let her go!\" he said to Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never, never, never!\" cried Mrs. Beale. Maisie felt herself more\r\n",
      "compressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let her go!\" Sir Claude more intensely repeated. He was looking at Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale and there was something in his voice. Maisie knew from a loosening\r\n",
      "of arms that she had become conscious of what it was; she slowly rose\r\n",
      "from the sofa, and the child stood there again dropped and divided.\r\n",
      "\"You're free--you're free,\" Sir Claude went on; at which Maisie's back\r\n",
      "became aware of a push that vented resentment and that placed her again\r\n",
      "in the centre of the room, the cynosure of every eye and not knowing\r\n",
      "which way to turn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned with an effort to Mrs. Wix. \"I didn't refuse to give you up.\r\n",
      "I said I would if HE'D give up--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Give up Mrs. Beale?\" burst from Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Give up Mrs. Beale. What do you call that but exquisite?\" Sir Claude\r\n",
      "demanded of all of them, the lady mentioned included; speaking with a\r\n",
      "relish as intense now as if some lovely work of art or of nature had\r\n",
      "suddenly been set down among them. He was rapidly recovering himself on\r\n",
      "this basis of fine appreciation. \"She made her condition--with such a\r\n",
      "sense of what it should be! She made the only right one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The only right one?\"--Mrs. Beale returned to the charge. She had taken\r\n",
      "a moment before a snub from him, but she was not to be snubbed on this.\r\n",
      "\"How can you talk such rubbish and how can you back her up in such\r\n",
      "impertinence? What in the world have you done to her to make her think\r\n",
      "of such stuff?\" She stood there in righteous wrath; she flashed her eyes\r\n",
      "round the circle. Maisie took them full in her own, knowing that here at\r\n",
      "last was the moment she had had most to reckon with. But as regards her\r\n",
      "stepdaughter Mrs. Beale subdued herself to a question deeply mild. \"HAVE\r\n",
      "you made, my own love, any such condition as that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Somehow, now that it was there, the great moment was not so bad. What\r\n",
      "helped the child was that she knew what she wanted. All her learning and\r\n",
      "learning had made her at last learn that; so that if she waited an\r\n",
      "instant to reply it was only from the desire to be nice. Bewilderment\r\n",
      "had simply gone or at any rate was going fast. Finally she answered.\r\n",
      "\"Will you give HIM up? Will you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah leave her alone--leave her, leave her!\" Sir Claude in sudden\r\n",
      "supplication murmured to Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix at the same instant found another apostrophe. \"Isn't it enough\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I think you had better go--you must really catch your boat,\" Sir Claude\r\n",

      "quickly?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With the child as quickly as you like. Not without her.\" Mrs. Wix was\r\n",
      "adamant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why did you lie to me, you fiend?\" Mrs. Beale almost yelled. \"Why\r\n",
      "did you tell me an hour ago that you had given her up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because I despaired of her--because I thought she had left me.\" Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix turned to Maisie. \"You were WITH them--in their connexion. But now\r\n",
      "your eyes are open, and I take you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No you don't!\" and Mrs. Beale made, with a great fierce jump, a wild\r\n",
      "snatch at her stepdaughter. She caught her by the arm and, completing an\r\n",
      "instinctive movement, whirled her round in a further leap to the door,\r\n",
      "which had been closed by Sir Claude the instant their voices had risen.\r\n",
      "She fell back against it and, even while denouncing and waving off Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wix, kept it closed in an incoherence of passion. \"You don't take her,\r\n",
      "but you bundle yourself: she stays with her own people and she's rid of\r\n",
      "you! I never heard anything so monstrous!\" Sir Claude had rescued Maisie\r\n",
      "and kept hold of her; he held her in front of him, resting his hands\r\n",
      "very lightly on her shoulders and facing the loud adversaries. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Beale's flush had dropped; she had turned pale with a splendid wrath.\r\n",
      "She kept protesting and dismissing Mrs. Wix; she glued her back to the\r\n",
      "door to prevent Maisie's flight; she drove out Mrs. Wix by the window or\r\n",
      "the chimney. \"You're a nice one--'discussing relations'--with your talk\r\n",
      "of our 'connexion' and your insults! What in the world's our connexion\r\n",
      "but the love of the child who's our duty and our life and who holds us\r\n",
      "together as closely as she originally brought us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know, I know!\" Maisie said with a burst of eagerness. \"I did bring\r\n",
      "you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The strangest of laughs escaped from Sir Claude. \"You did bring us--you\r\n",
      "did!\" His hands went up and down gently on her shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix so dominated the situation that she had something sharp for\r\n",
      "every one. \"There you have it, you see!\" she pregnantly remarked to her\r\n",
      "pupil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"WILL you give him up?\" Maisie persisted to Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To YOU, you abominable little horror?\" that lady indignantly enquired,\r\n",
      "\"and to this raving old demon who has filled your dreadful little mind\r\n",
      "with her wickedness? Have you been a hideous little hypocrite all these\r\n",
      "years that I've slaved to make you love me and deludedly believed you\r\n",
      "did?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I love Sir Claude--I love HIM,\" Maisie replied with an awkward sense\r\n",
      "that she appeared to offer it as something that would do as well. Sir\r\n",
      "Claude had continued to pat her, and it was really an answer to his\r\n",
      "pats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She hates you--she hates you,\" he observed with the oddest quietness to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His quietness made her blaze. \"And you back her up in it and give me up\r\n",
      "to outrage?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; I only insist that she's free--she's free.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale stared--Mrs. Beale glared. \"Free to starve with this pauper\r\n",
      "lunatic?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll do more for her than YOU ever did!\" Mrs. Wix retorted. \"I'll work\r\n",
      "my fingers to the bone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie, with Sir Claude's hands still on her shoulders, felt, just as\r\n",
      "she felt the fine surrender in them, that over her head he looked in a\r\n",
      "certain way at Mrs. Wix. \"You needn't do that,\" she heard him say. \"She\r\n",
      "has means.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Means?--Maisie?\" Mrs. Beale shrieked. \"Means that her vile father has\r\n",
      "stolen!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll get them back--I'll get them back. I'll look into it.\" He smiled\r\n",
      "and nodded at Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This had a fearful effect on his other friend. \"Haven't I looked into\r\n",
      "it, I should like to know, and haven't I found an abyss? It's too\r\n",
      "inconceivable--your cruelty to me!\" she wildly broke out. She had hot\r\n",
      "tears in her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He spoke to her very kindly, almost coaxingly. \"We'll look into it\r\n",
      "again; we'll look into it together. It IS an abyss, but he CAN be\r\n",
      "made--or Ida can. Think of the money they're getting now!\" he laughed.\r\n",
      "\"It's all right, it's all right,\" he continued. \"It wouldn't do--it\r\n",
      "wouldn't do. We CAN'T work her in. It's perfectly true--she's unique.\r\n",
      "We're not good enough--oh no!\" and, quite exuberantly, he laughed again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not good enough, and that beast IS?\" Mrs. Beale shouted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this for a moment there was a hush in the room, and in the midst of\r\n",
      "it Sir Claude replied to the question by moving with Maisie to Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "The next thing the child knew she was at that lady's side with an arm\r\n",
      "firmly grasped. Mrs. Beale still guarded the door. \"Let them pass,\" said\r\n",
      "Sir Claude at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She remained there, however; Maisie saw the pair look at each other.\r\n",
      "Then she saw Mrs. Beale turn to her. \"I'm your mother now, Maisie. And\r\n",
      "he's your father.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just where it is!\" sighed Mrs. Wix with an effect of irony\r\n",
      "positively detached and philosophic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale continued to address her young friend, and her effort to be\r\n",
      "reasonable and tender was in its way remarkable. \"We're representative,\r\n",
      "you know, of Mr. Farange and his former wife. This person represents\r\n",
      "mere illiterate presumption. We take our stand on the law.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh the law, the law!\" Mrs. Wix superbly jeered. \"You had better indeed\r\n",
      "let the law have a look at you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let them pass--let them pass!\" Sir Claude pressed his friend hard--he\r\n",
      "pleaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she fastened herself still to Maisie. \"DO you hate me, dearest?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie looked at her with new eyes, but answered as she had answered\r\n",
      "before. \"Will you give him up?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale's rejoinder hung fire, but when it came it was noble. \"You\r\n",
      "shouldn't talk to me of such things!\" She was shocked, she was\r\n",
      "scandalised to tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For Mrs. Wix, however, it was her discrimination that was indelicate.\r\n",
      "\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" she roundly cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude made a supreme appeal. \"Will you be so good as to allow these\r\n",
      "horrors to terminate?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale fixed her eyes on him, and again Maisie watched them. \"You\r\n",
      "should do him justice,\" Mrs. Wix went on to Mrs. Beale. \"We've always\r\n",
      "been devoted to him, Maisie and I--and he has shown how much he likes\r\n",
      "us. He would like to please her; he would like even, I think, to please\r\n",
      "me. But he hasn't given you up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They stood confronted, the step-parents, still under Maisie's\r\n",
      "observation. That observation had never sunk so deep as at this\r\n",
      "particular moment. \"Yes, my dear, I haven't given you up,\" Sir Claude\r\n",
      "said to Mrs. Beale at last, \"and if you'd like me to treat our friends\r\n",
      "here as solemn witnesses I don't mind giving you my word for it that I\r\n",
      "never never will. There!\" he dauntlessly exclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He can't!\" Mrs. Wix tragically commented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale, erect and alive in her defeat, jerked her handsome face\r\n",
      "about. \"He can't!\" she literally mocked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He can't, he can't, he can't!\"--Sir Claude's gay emphasis wonderfully\r\n",
      "carried it off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale took it all in, yet she held her ground; on which Maisie\r\n",
      "addressed Mrs. Wix. \"Shan't we lose the boat?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, we shall lose the boat,\" Mrs. Wix remarked to Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale meanwhile faced full at Maisie. \"I don't know what to make of\r\n",
      "you!\" she launched.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye,\" said Maisie to Sir Claude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Maisie,\" Sir Claude answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beale came away from the door. \"Goodbye!\" she hurled at Maisie;\r\n",
      "then passed straight across the room and disappeared in the adjoining\r\n",
      "one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Claude had reached the other door and opened it. Mrs. Wix was\r\n",
      "already out. On the threshold Maisie paused; she put out her hand to her\r\n",
      "stepfather. He took it and held it a moment, and their eyes met as the\r\n",
      "eyes of those who have done for each other what they can. \"Good-bye,\" he\r\n",
      "repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye.\" And Maisie followed Mrs. Wix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They caught the steamer, which was just putting off, and, hustled across\r\n",
      "the gulf, found themselves on the deck so breathless and so scared that\r\n",
      "they gave up half the voyage to letting their emotion sink. It sank\r\n",
      "slowly and imperfectly; but at last, in mid-channel, surrounded by the\r\n",
      "quiet sea, Mrs. Wix had courage to revert. \"I didn't look back, did\r\n",
      "you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. He wasn't there,\" said Maisie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not on the balcony?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maisie waited a moment; then \"He wasn't there\" she simply said again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Wix also was silent a while. \"He went to HER,\" she finally\r\n",
      "observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I know!\" the child replied.\r\n",

      "I blushed for the poverty of imagination involved in my small\r\n",

      "wasn't that he seemed to thirst for justice; on the contrary I hadn't yet\r\n",

      "of the sources of his good humour to be precisely that his success was\r\n",
      "independent of that.  He had none the less become in a manner the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Miss Poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth.  \"Oh, you're so deep!\"\r\n",

      "\"As deep as the ocean!  All I pretend is that the author doesn't see--\"\r\n",

      "myself.  \"Nobody sees anything!\" she cheerfully announced; to which I\r\n",
      "replied that I had often thought so too, but had somehow taken the\r\n",
      "thought for a proof on my own part of a tremendous eye.  I didn't tell\r\n",
      "her the article was mine; and I observed that Lady Jane, occupied at the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I rather avoided him after dinner, for I confess he struck me as cruelly\r\n",
      "conceited, and the revelation was a pain.  \"The usual twaddle\"--my acute\r\n",
      "little study!  That one's admiration should have had a reserve or two\r\n",
      "could gall him to that point!  I had thought him placid, and he was\r\n",
      "placid enough; such a surface was the hard polished glass that encased\r\n",
      "the bauble of his vanity.  I was really ruffled, and the only comfort was\r\n",
      "that if nobody saw anything George Corvick was quite as much out of it as\r\n",

      "been up once more to change, coming out of his room.  _He_ was humming an\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "hearing that I had come up to bed he asked leave to cross my threshold\r\n",
      "and just tell me in three words what his qualification of my remarks had\r\n",
      "represented.  It was plain he really feared I was hurt, and the sense of\r\n",
      "his solicitude suddenly made all the difference to me.  My cheap review\r\n",
      "fluttered off into space, and the best things I had said in it became\r\n",

      "of praising him.  To make the thing right he talked to me exactly as an\r\n",
      "equal and on the ground of what we both loved best.  The hour, the place,\r\n",

      "he were, pray, what would he be doing in his neighbour's garden?  You're\r\n",
      "anything but a plain man yourself, and the very raison d'etre of you all\r\n",

      "RETURNING to town I feverishly collected them all; I picked out each in\r\n",
      "its order and held it up to the light.  This gave me a maddening month,\r\n",
      "in the course of which several things took place.  One of these, the\r\n",
      "last, I may as well immediately mention, was that I acted on Vereker's\r\n",
      "advice: I renounced my ridiculous attempt.  I could really make nothing\r\n",
      "of the business; it proved a dead loss.  After all I had always, as he\r\n",

      "failed to run a general intention to earth, I found myself missing the\r\n",
      "subordinate intentions I had formerly enjoyed.  His books didn't even\r\n",
      "remain the charming things they had been for me; the exasperation of my\r\n",

      "more they became a resource the less; for from the moment I was unable to\r\n",

      "make use professionally of my knowledge of them.  I _had_ no\r\n",
      "knowledge--nobody had any.  It was humiliating, but I could bear it--they\r\n",
      "only annoyed me now.  At last they even bored me, and I accounted for my\r\n",
      "confusion--perversely, I allow--by the idea that Vereker had made a fool\r\n",
      "of me.  The buried treasure was a bad joke, the general intention a\r\n",
      "monstrous pose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The great point of it all is, however, that I told George Corvick what\r\n",
      "had befallen me and that my information had an immense effect upon him.\r\n",
      "He had at last come back, but so, unfortunately, had Mrs. Erme, and there\r\n",
      "was as yet, I could see, no question of his nuptials.  He was immensely\r\n",
      "stirred up by the anecdote I had brought from Bridges; it fell in so\r\n",
      "completely with the sense he had had from the first that there was more\r\n",
      "in Vereker than met the eye.  When I remarked that the eye seemed what\r\n",
      "the printed page had been expressly invented to meet he immediately\r\n",
      "accused me of being spiteful because I had been foiled.  Our commerce had\r\n",
      "always that pleasant latitude.  The thing Vereker had mentioned to me was\r\n",

      "would doubtless be prepared to speak of it himself he admitted freely\r\n",
      "that before doing this there was more he must understand.  What he would\r\n",
      "have said, had he reviewed the new book, was that there was evidently in\r\n",
      "the writer's inmost art something to _be_ understood.  I hadn't so much\r\n",
      "as hinted at that: no wonder the writer hadn't been flattered!  I asked\r\n",
      "Corvick what he really considered he meant by his own supersubtlety, and,\r\n",
      "unmistakeably kindled, he replied: \"It isn't for the vulgar--it isn't for\r\n",
      "the vulgar!\"  He had hold of the tail of something; he would pull hard,\r\n",
      "pull it right out.  He pumped me dry on Vereker's strange confidence and,\r\n",
      "pronouncing me the luckiest of mortals, mentioned half a dozen questions\r\n",
      "he wished to goodness I had had the gumption to put.  Yet on the other\r\n",
      "hand he didn't want to be told too much--it would spoil the fun of seeing\r\n",
      "what would come.  The failure of _my_ fun was at the moment of our\r\n",
      "meeting not complete, but I saw it ahead, and Corvick saw that I saw it.\r\n",
      "I, on my side, saw likewise that one of the first things he would do\r\n",
      "would be to rush off with my story to Gwendolen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the very day after my talk with him I was surprised by the receipt of\r\n",

      "recalled, as he mentioned, by his falling, in a magazine, on some article\r\n",
      "to which my signature was attached.  \"I read it with great pleasure,\" he\r\n",
      "wrote, \"and remembered under its influence our lively conversation by\r\n",
      "your bedroom fire.  The consequence of this has been that I begin to\r\n",
      "measure the temerity of my having saddled you with a knowledge that you\r\n",
      "may find something of a burden.  Now that the fit's over I can't imagine\r\n",
      "how I came to be moved so much beyond my wont.  I had never before\r\n",
      "mentioned, no matter in what state of expansion, the fact of my little\r\n",
      "secret, and I shall never speak of that mystery again.  I was\r\n",
      "accidentally so much more explicit with you than it had ever entered into\r\n",
      "my game to be, that I find this game--I mean the pleasure of playing\r\n",
      "it--suffers considerably.  In short, if you can understand it, I've\r\n",
      "rather spoiled my sport.  I really don't want to give anybody what I\r\n",
      "believe you clever young men call the tip.  That's of course a selfish\r\n",
      "solicitude, and I name it to you for what it may be worth to you.  If\r\n",
      "you're disposed to humour me don't repeat my revelation.  Think me\r\n",
      "demented--it's your right; but don't tell anybody why.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sequel to this communication was that as early on the morrow as I\r\n",
      "dared I drove straight to Mr. Vereker's door.  He occupied in those years\r\n",
      "one of the honest old houses in Kensington Square.  He received me\r\n",
      "immediately, and as soon as I came in I saw I hadn't lost my power to\r\n",
      "minister to his mirth.  He laughed out at sight of my face, which\r\n",
      "doubtless expressed my perturbation.  I had been indiscreet--my\r\n",
      "compunction was great.  \"I _have_ told somebody,\" I panted, \"and I'm sure\r\n",
      "that person will by this time have told somebody else!  It's a woman,\r\n",
      "into the bargain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The person you've told?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, but she'll talk all over the place: she'll do just what you don't\r\n",
      "want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vereker thought a moment, but wasn't so disconcerted as I had feared: he\r\n",
      "felt that if the harm was done it only served him right.  \"It doesn't\r\n",

      "divergence of our respective estimates mentioned that my friend was\r\n",
      "already of opinion that he saw much further into a certain affair than\r\n",
      "most people.  He was quite as fired as I had been at Bridges.  He was\r\n",

      "evidently didn't think me intellectually equipped for the adventure.  I\r\n",
      "stayed half an hour, and he was most good-natured, but I couldn't help\r\n",
      "pronouncing him a man of unstable moods.  He had been free with me in a\r\n",
      "mood, he had repented in a mood, and now in a mood he had turned\r\n",
      "indifferent.  This general levity helped me to believe that, so far as\r\n",
      "the subject of the tip went, there wasn't much in it.  I contrived\r\n",
      "however to make him answer a few more questions about it, though he did\r\n",
      "so with visible impatience.  For himself, beyond doubt, the thing we were\r\n",
      "all so blank about was vividly there.  It was something, I guessed, in\r\n",
      "the primal plan, something like a complex figure in a Persian carpet.  He\r\n",
      "highly approved of this image when I used it, and he used another\r\n",
      "himself.  \"It's the very string,\" he said, \"that my pearls are strung\r\n",
      "on!\"  The reason of his note to me had been that he really didn't want to\r\n",
      "give us a grain of succour--our density was a thing too perfect in its\r\n",
      "way to touch.  He had formed the habit of depending on it, and if the\r\n",
      "spell was to break it must break by some force of its own.  He comes back\r\n",
      "to me from that last occasion--for I was never to speak to him again--as\r\n",

      "feel that any doubt of his delicacy would be almost an insult.  He had\r\n",
      "instantly told Gwendolen, but Gwendolen's ardent response was in itself a\r\n",
      "pledge of discretion.  The question would now absorb them and would offer\r\n",
      "them a pastime too precious to be shared with the crowd.  They appeared\r\n",
      "to have caught instinctively at Vereker's high idea of enjoyment.  Their\r\n",

      "irritating and quite envenomed my doubts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That statement looks unamiable, and what probably happened was that I\r\n",
      "felt humiliated at seeing other persons deeply beguiled by an experiment\r\n",
      "that had brought me only chagrin.  I was out in the cold while, by the\r\n",
      "evening fire, under the lamp, they followed the chase for which I myself\r\n",
      "had sounded the horn.  They did as I had done, only more deliberately and\r\n",
      "sociably--they went over their author from the beginning.  There was no\r\n",
      "hurry, Corvick said the future was before them and the fascination could\r\n",
      "only grow; they would take him page by page, as they would take one of\r\n",
      "the classics, inhale him in slow draughts and let him sink all the way\r\n",
      "in.  They would scarce have got so wound up, I think, if they hadn't been\r\n",
      "in love: poor Vereker's inner meaning gave them endless occasion to put\r\n",
      "and to keep their young heads together.  None the less it represented the\r\n",
      "kind of problem for which Corvick had a special aptitude, drew out the\r\n",
      "particular pointed patience of which, had he lived, he would have given\r\n",
      "more striking and, it is to be hoped, more fruitful examples.  He at\r\n",
      "least was, in Vereker's words, a little demon of subtlety.  We had begun\r\n",
      "by disputing, but I soon saw that without my stirring a finger his\r\n",
      "infatuation would have its bad hours.  He would bound off on false scents\r\n",
      "as I had done--he would clap his hands over new lights and see them blown\r\n",
      "out by the wind of the turned page.  He was like nothing, I told him, but\r\n",
      "the maniacs who embrace some bedlamitical theory of the cryptic character\r\n",
      "of Shakespeare.  To this he replied that if we had had Shakespeare's own\r\n",
      "word for his being cryptic he would at once have accepted it.  The case\r\n",
      "there was altogether different--we had nothing but the word of Mr.\r\n",
      "Snooks.  I returned that I was stupefied to see him attach such\r\n",
      "importance even to the word of Mr. Vereker.  He wanted thereupon to know\r\n",
      "if I treated Mr. Vereker's word as a lie.  I wasn't perhaps prepared, in\r\n",
      "my unhappy rebound, to go so far as that, but I insisted that till the\r\n",
      "contrary was proved I should view it as too fond an imagination.  I\r\n",
      "didn't, I confess, say--I didn't at that time quite know--all I felt.\r\n",

      "At the core of my disconcerted state--for my wonted curiosity lived in\r\n",
      "its ashes--was the sharpness of a sense that Corvick would at last\r\n",
      "probably come out somewhere.  He made, in defence of his credulity, a\r\n",
      "great point of the fact that from of old, in his study of this genius, he\r\n",
      "had caught whiffs and hints of he didn't know what, faint wandering notes\r\n",
      "of a hidden music.  That was just the rarity, that was the charm: it\r\n",

      "those of a chessplayer bent with a silent scowl, all the lamplit winter,\r\n",
      "over his board and his moves.  As my imagination filled it out the\r\n",
      "picture held me fast.  On the other side of the table was a ghostlier\r\n",
      "form, the faint figure of an antagonist good-humouredly but a little\r\n",
      "wearily secure--an antagonist who leaned back in his chair with his hands\r\n",
      "in his pockets and a smile on his fine clear face.  Close to Corvick,\r\n",
      "behind him, was a girl who had begun to strike me as pale and wasted and\r\n",

      "dregs of delay.  We understood his staying on, and yet each of us saw, I\r\n",

      "through all time and taking all tongues, one of the most wonderful\r\n",
      "flowers of literary art.  Nothing, in especial, once you were face to\r\n",

      "simple, yet so great, and the final knowledge of it was an experience\r\n",
      "quite apart.  He intimated that the charm of such an experience, the\r\n",
      "desire to drain it, in its freshness, to the last drop, was what kept him\r\n",
      "there close to the source.  Gwendolen, frankly radiant as she tossed me\r\n",
      "these fragments, showed the elation of a prospect more assured than my\r\n",
      "own.  That brought me back to the question of her marriage, prompted me\r\n",

      "contrary.  I didn't mention this, however; I only reminded her how little\r\n",

      "I had simply, I suppose, a change of heart, and it must have begun when I\r\n",
      "received my manuscript back from Mr. Pinhorn.  Mr. Pinhorn was my\r\n",
      "\"chief,\" as he was called in the office: he had the high mission of\r\n",
      "bringing the paper up.  This was a weekly periodical, which had been\r\n",
      "supposed to be almost past redemption when he took hold of it.  It was\r\n",
      "Mr. Deedy who had let the thing down so dreadfully: he was never\r\n",
      "mentioned in the office now save in connexion with that misdemeanour.\r\n",
      "Young as I was I had been in a manner taken over from Mr. Deedy, who had\r\n",
      "been owner as well as editor; forming part of a promiscuous lot, mainly\r\n",
      "plant and office-furniture, which poor Mrs. Deedy, in her bereavement and\r\n",
      "depression, parted with at a rough valuation.  I could account for my\r\n",
      "continuity but on the supposition that I had been cheap.  I rather\r\n",
      "resented the practice of fathering all flatness on my late protector, who\r\n",
      "was in his unhonoured grave; but as I had my way to make I found matter\r\n",
      "enough for complacency in being on a \"staff.\"  At the same time I was\r\n",
      "aware of my exposure to suspicion as a product of the old lowering\r\n",
      "system.  This made me feel I was doubly bound to have ideas, and had\r\n",
      "doubtless been at the bottom of my proposing to Mr. Pinhorn that I should\r\n",
      "lay my lean hands on Neil Paraday.  I remember how he looked at\r\n",
      "me--quite, to begin with, as if he had never heard of this celebrity, who\r\n",
      "indeed at that moment was by no means in the centre of the heavens; and\r\n",
      "even when I had knowingly explained he expressed but little confidence in\r\n",
      "the demand for any such stuff.  When I had reminded him that the great\r\n",
      "principle on which we were supposed to work was just to create the demand\r\n",
      "we required, he considered a moment and then returned: \"I see--you want\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "scruples presented themselves as mere ignoble thrift to his successor,\r\n",
      "whose own sincerity took the form of ringing door-bells and whose\r\n",
      "definition of genius was the art of finding people at home.  It was as if\r\n",
      "Mr. Deedy had published reports without his young men's having, as\r\n",
      "Pinhorn would have said, really been there.  I was unregenerate, as I\r\n",
      "have hinted, and couldn't be concerned to straighten out the journalistic\r\n",
      "morals of my chief, feeling them indeed to be an abyss over the edge of\r\n",
      "which it was better not to peer.  Really to be there this time moreover\r\n",
      "was a vision that made the idea of writing something subtle about Neil\r\n",
      "Paraday only the more inspiring.  I would be as considerate as even Mr.\r\n",
      "Deedy could have wished, and yet I should be as present as only Mr.\r\n",
      "Pinhorn could conceive.  My allusion to the sequestered manner in which\r\n",
      "Mr. Paraday lived--it had formed part of my explanation, though I knew of\r\n",
      "it only by hearsay--was, I could divine, very much what had made Mr.\r\n",
      "Pinhorn nibble.  It struck him as inconsistent with the success of his\r\n",

      "immediate exposure of everything just what the public wanted?  Mr.\r\n",
      "Pinhorn effectually called me to order by reminding me of the promptness\r\n",
      "with which I had met Miss Braby at Liverpool on her return from her\r\n",

      "Empire_ of that morning.  It regularly came to Paraday, but I remembered\r\n",
      "that neither of us had yet looked at the copy already delivered.  This\r\n",
      "one had a great mark on the \"editorial\" page, and, uncrumpling the\r\n",

      "already aware of it, fired, as if on the birth of a prince, a salute of a\r\n",
      "whole column.  The guns had been booming these three hours in the house\r\n",
      "without our suspecting them.  The big blundering newspaper had discovered\r\n",
      "him, and now he was proclaimed and anointed and crowned.  His place was\r\n",
      "assigned him as publicly as if a fat usher with a wand had pointed to the\r\n",

      "child.  She was a blind violent force to which I could attach no more\r\n",
      "idea of responsibility than to the creaking of a sign in the wind.  It\r\n",
      "was difficult to say what she conduced to but circulation.  She was\r\n",

      "and recognition had to be reciprocal.  The monastic life, the pious\r\n",
      "illumination of the missal in the convent cell were things of the\r\n",
      "gathered past.  It didn't engender despair, but at least it required\r\n",
      "adjustment.  Before I left him on that occasion we had passed a bargain,\r\n",

      "of the book itself.  This was why I carried it to Albemarle Street no\r\n",
      "later than on the morrow.  I failed to find her at home, but she wrote to\r\n",
      "me and I went again; she wanted so much to hear more about Neil Paraday.\r\n",
      "I returned repeatedly, I may briefly declare, to supply her with this\r\n",
      "information.  She had been immensely taken, the more she thought of it,\r\n",
      "with that idea of mine about the act of homage: it had ended by filling\r\n",
      "her with a generous rapture.  She positively desired to do something\r\n",
      "sublime for him, though indeed I could see that, as this particular\r\n",
      "flight was difficult, she appreciated the fact that my visits kept her\r\n",
      "up.  I had it on my conscience to keep her up: I neglected nothing that\r\n",
      "would contribute to it, and her conception of our cherished author's\r\n",
      "independence became at last as fine as his very own.  \"Read him, read\r\n",
      "him--_that_ will be an education in decency,\" I constantly repeated;\r\n",
      "while, seeking him in his works even as God in nature, she represented\r\n",
      "herself as convinced that, according to my assurance, this was the system\r\n",
      "that had, as she expressed it, weaned her.  We read him together when I\r\n",
      "could find time, and the generous creature's sacrifice was fed by our\r\n",
      "communion.  There were twenty selfish women about whom I told her and who\r\n",
      "stirred her to a beautiful rage.  Immediately after my first visit her\r\n",
      "sister, Mrs. Milsom, came over from Paris, and the two ladies began to\r\n",
      "present, as they called it, their letters.  I thanked our stars that none\r\n",
      "had been presented to Mr. Paraday.  They received invitations and dined\r\n",
      "out, and some of these occasions enabled Fanny Hurter to perform, for\r\n",
      "consistency's sake, touching feats of submission.  Nothing indeed would\r\n",
      "now have induced her even to look at the object of her admiration.  Once,\r\n",
      "hearing his name announced at a party, she instantly left the room by\r\n",
      "another door and then straightway quitted the house.  At another time\r\n",
      "when I was at the opera with them--Mrs. Milsom had invited me to their\r\n",
      "box--I attempted to point Mr. Paraday out to her in the stalls.  On this\r\n",
      "she asked her sister to change places with her and, while that lady\r\n",
      "devoured the great man through a powerful glass, presented, all the rest\r\n",
      "of the evening, her inspired back to the house.  To torment her tenderly\r\n",
      "I pressed the glass upon her, telling her how wonderfully near it brought\r\n",
      "our friend's handsome head.  By way of answer she simply looked at me in\r\n",
      "charged silence, letting me see that tears had gathered in her eyes.\r\n",
      "These tears, I may remark, produced an effect on me of which the end is\r\n",
      "not yet.  There was a moment when I felt it my duty to mention them to\r\n",
      "Neil Paraday, but I was deterred by the reflexion that there were\r\n",
      "questions more relevant to his happiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These question indeed, by the end of the season, were reduced to a single\r\n",
      "one--the question of reconstituting so far as might be possible the\r\n",
      "conditions under which he had produced his best work.  Such conditions\r\n",
      "could never all come back, for there was a new one that took up too much\r\n",
      "place; but some perhaps were not beyond recall.  I wanted above all\r\n",
      "things to see him sit down to the subject he had, on my making his\r\n",

      "was no security but in his doing so before the new factor, as we used to\r\n",
      "say at Mr. Pinhorn's, should render the problem incalculable.  It only\r\n",
      "half-reassured me that the sketch itself was so copious and so eloquent\r\n",
      "that even at the worst there would be the making of a small but complete\r\n",
      "book, a tiny volume which, for the faithful, might well become an object\r\n",
      "of adoration.  There would even not be wanting critics to declare, I\r\n",
      "foresaw, that the plan was a thing to be more thankful for than the\r\n",
      "structure to have been reared on it.  My impatience for the structure,\r\n",
      "none the less, grew and grew with the interruptions.  He had on coming up\r\n",
      "to town begun to sit for his portrait to a young painter, Mr. Rumble,\r\n",
      "whose little game, as we also used to say at Mr. Pinhorn's, was to be the\r\n",
      "first to perch on the shoulders of renown.  Mr. Rumble's studio was a\r\n",
      "circus in which the man of the hour, and still more the woman, leaped\r\n",
      "through the hoops of his showy frames almost as electrically as they\r\n",
      "burst into telegrams and \"specials.\"  He pranced into the exhibitions on\r\n",
      "their back; he was the reporter on canvas, the Vandyke up to date, and\r\n",
      "there was one roaring year in which Mrs. Bounder and Miss Braby, Guy\r\n",
      "Walsingham and Dora Forbes proclaimed in chorus from the same pictured\r\n",
      "walls that no one had yet got ahead of him.\r\n",

      "Paraday had been promptly caught and saddled, accepting with\r\n",
      "characteristic good-humour his confidential hint that to figure in his\r\n",
      "show was not so much a consequence as a cause of immortality.  From Mrs.\r\n",
      "Wimbush to the last \"representative\" who called to ascertain his twelve\r\n",
      "favourite dishes, it was the same ingenuous assumption that he would\r\n",
      "rejoice in the repercussion.  There were moments when I fancied I might\r\n",
      "have had more patience with them if they hadn't been so fatally\r\n",
      "benevolent.  I hated at all events Mr. Rumble's picture, and had my\r\n",
      "bottled resentment ready when, later on, I found my distracted friend had\r\n",
      "been stuffed by Mrs. Wimbush into the mouth of another cannon.  A young\r\n",
      "artist in whom she was intensely interested, and who had no connexion\r\n",
      "with Mr. Rumble, was to show how far he could make him go.  Poor Paraday,\r\n",
      "in return, was naturally to write something somewhere about the young\r\n",
      "artist.  She played her victims against each other with admirable\r\n",
      "ingenuity, and her establishment was a huge machine in which the tiniest\r\n",
      "and the biggest wheels went round to the same treadle.  I had a scene\r\n",
      "with her in which I tried to express that the function of such a man was\r\n",
      "to exercise his genius--not to serve as a hoarding for pictorial posters.\r\n",
      "The people I was perhaps angriest with were the editors of magazines who\r\n",
      "had introduced what they called new features, so aware were they that the\r\n",
      "newest feature of all would be to make him grind their axes by\r\n",
      "contributing his views on vital topics and taking part in the periodical\r\n",
      "prattle about the future of fiction.  I made sure that before I should\r\n",
      "have done with him there would scarcely be a current form of words left\r\n",
      "me to be sick of; but meanwhile I could make surer still of my animosity\r\n",
      "to bustling ladies for whom he drew the water that irrigated their social\r\n",
      "flower-beds.\r\n",

      "another over the question of a certain week, at the end of July, that Mr.\r\n",
      "Paraday appeared to have contracted to spend with her in the country.  I\r\n",
      "protested against this visit; I intimated that he was too unwell for\r\n",
      "hospitality without a nuance, for caresses without imagination; I begged\r\n",
      "he might rather take the time in some restorative way.  A sultry air of\r\n",
      "promises, of ponderous parties, hung over his August, and he would\r\n",
      "greatly profit by the interval of rest.  He hadn't told me he was ill\r\n",
      "again that he had had a warning; but I hadn't needed this, for I found\r\n",
      "his reticence his worst symptom.  The only thing he said to me was that\r\n",
      "he believed a comfortable attack of something or other would set him up:\r\n",
      "it would put out of the question everything but the exemptions he prized.\r\n",
      "I'm afraid I shall have presented him as a martyr in a very small cause\r\n",
      "if I fail to explain that he surrendered himself much more liberally than\r\n",
      "I surrendered him.  He filled his lungs, for the most part; with the\r\n",
      "comedy of his queer fate: the tragedy was in the spectacles through which\r\n",
      "I chose to look.  He was conscious of inconvenience, and above all of a\r\n",
      "great renouncement; but how could he have heard a mere dirge in the bells\r\n",
      "of his accession?  The sagacity and the jealousy were mine, and his the\r\n",
      "impressions and the harvest.  Of course, as regards Mrs. Wimbush, I was\r\n",
      "worsted in my encounters, for wasn't the state of his health the very\r\n",
      "reason for his coming to her at Prestidge?  Wasn't it precisely at\r\n",

      "was of a famous foreign house, and, in her gilded cage, with her retinue\r\n",
      "of keepers and feeders, was the most expensive specimen in the good\r\n",
      "lady's collection.  I don't think her august presence had had to do with\r\n",

      "He had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\r\n",
      "them still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\r\n",
      "suppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\r\n",
      "a place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\r\n",
      "of Mary Antrim's death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\r\n",
      "that this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\r\n",
      "doing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\r\n",
      "which time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\r\n",
      "feast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\r\n",
      "marriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\r\n",
      "matter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\r\n",
      "bridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\r\n",
      "had been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\r\n",
      "that promised to fill his life to the brim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\r\n",
      "could really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\r\n",
      "ordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\r\n",
      "passions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\r\n",
      "him than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\r\n",
      "to make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world--he\r\n",
      "had done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\r\n",
      "to put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\r\n",
      "failed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\r\n",
      "absent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\r\n",
      "his tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\r\n",
      "nerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\r\n",
      "the goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\r\n",
      "suburb, a part then of Nature's breast, but which he had seen lose one\r\n",
      "after another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\r\n",
      "moments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\r\n",
      "at another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\r\n",
      "future?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\r\n",
      "immense escape from the actual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's true that if there weren't other dates than this there were other\r\n",
      "memories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\r\n",
      "had greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\r\n",
      "ghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\r\n",
      "but he had counted his losses more; he hadn't seen death more closely,\r\n",
      "but had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\r\n",
      "the habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\r\n",
      "there was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\r\n",
      "simplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\r\n",
      "patience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\r\n",
      "When all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\r\n",
      "their purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\r\n",
      "they got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\r\n",
      "hard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\r\n",
      "honour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\r\n",
      "living, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\r\n",
      "others.  So on George Stransom's part had grown up with the years a\r\n",
      "resolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\r\n",
      "own--would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\r\n",
      "his own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\r\n",
      "the soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\r\n",
      "the years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\r\n",
      "these postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\r\n",
      "thoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\r\n",
      "charity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\r\n",
      "but what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\r\n",
      "everybody's compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\r\n",
      "these secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\r\n",
      "wondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\r\n",
      "very sure, and not a little content, that he hadn't at all events the\r\n",
      "religion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\r\n",
      "this question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\r\n",
      "the religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\r\n",
      "religion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\r\n",
      "spirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\r\n",
      "offices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\r\n",
      "bedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\r\n",
      "was attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\r\n",
      "were accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\r\n",
      "could build such temples of the spirit--could make them blaze with\r\n",
      "candles and smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and\r\n",
      "flowers.  The cost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly\r\n",

      "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\r\n",
      "not unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\r\n",
      "a busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\r\n",
      "of a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\r\n",
      "and before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\r\n",
      "jeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\r\n",
      "high notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\r\n",
      "\"worth\" than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\r\n",
      "side of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\r\n",
      "a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\r\n",
      "an instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\r\n",
      "mumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\r\n",
      "his arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\r\n",
      "was talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\r\n",
      "Stransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\r\n",
      "just with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\r\n",
      "him in the very act of laying his hand on his friend's arm.  It lasted\r\n",
      "but the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\r\n",
      "question.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?--the ambiguity met him there in\r\n",
      "the short drop of her husband's voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\r\n",
      "and in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\r\n",
      "step to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\r\n",
      "exclaimed--behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\r\n",
      "Stransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\r\n",
      "the wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\r\n",
      "ravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\r\n",
      "That son of affliction wasn't in mourning now; he detached his arm from\r\n",
      "his companion's to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\r\n",
      "well as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\r\n",
      "tentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\r\n",

      "fellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Creston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\r\n",
      "rate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\r\n",
      "friend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\r\n",
      "talked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\r\n",
      "it for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\r\n",
      "exaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\r\n",
      "That new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\r\n",
      "been more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\r\n",
      "that shone as publicly as the jeweller's window, and in the happy candour\r\n",
      "with which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\r\n",
      "immodesty.  The character of Paul Creston's wife thus attributed to her\r\n",
      "was monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\r\n",
      "perfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\r\n",
      "and Stransom hadn't needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\r\n",
      "the lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband's\r\n",
      "confused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\r\n",
      "heard of poor Creston's having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\r\n",
      "crossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\r\n",
      "change.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\r\n",

      "he would, he couldn't, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\r\n",
      "look other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\r\n",

      "unapproachable shrine he had erected in his mind.  That shrine had begun\r\n",
      "in vague likeness to church pomps, but the echo had ended by growing more\r\n",
      "distinct than the sound.  The sound now rang out, the type blazed at him\r\n",
      "with all its fires and with a mystery of radiance in which endless\r\n",
      "meanings could glow.  The thing became as he sat there his appropriate\r\n",

      "become to him in the intermissions of toil and the dusk of afternoons;\r\n",
      "how rich in assurance at all times, but especially in the indifferent\r\n",

      "first sat down, and in the movement he met the lady whom he had seen\r\n",
      "praying and who was now on her way to the door.  She passed him quickly,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This was the origin of the rites more public, yet certainly esoteric,\r\n",
      "that he at last found himself able to establish.  It took a long time, it\r\n",
      "took a year, and both the process and the result would have been--for any\r\n",
      "who knew--a vivid picture of his good faith.  No one did know, in\r\n",

      "eccentric munificence he had eventually won, and who had asked for\r\n",
      "concessions in exchange for indulgences.  Stransom had of course at an\r\n",
      "early stage of his enquiry been referred to the Bishop, and the Bishop\r\n",
      "had been delightfully human, the Bishop had been almost amused.  Success\r\n",
      "was within sight, at any rate from the moment the attitude of those whom\r\n",
      "it concerned became liberal in response to liberality.  The altar and the\r\n",
      "sacred shell that half encircled it, consecrated to an ostensible and\r\n",
      "customary worship, were to be splendidly maintained; all that Stransom\r\n",
      "reserved to himself was the number of his lights and the free enjoyment\r\n",
      "of his intention.  When the intention had taken complete effect the\r\n",
      "enjoyment became even greater than he had ventured to hope.  He liked to\r\n",
      "think of this effect when far from it, liked to convince himself of it\r\n",
      "yet again when near.  He was not often indeed so near as that a visit to\r\n",

      "time he gave to his devotion came to seem to him more a contribution to\r\n",

      "year or two become the one it would have cost him most to relinquish.\r\n",
      "Now they had really, his Dead, something that was indefensibly theirs;\r\n",

      "kindled.  This was what he had fundamentally agreed for, that there\r\n",

      "saw was simply the most resplendent of the altars called suddenly into\r\n",
      "vivid usefulness, with a quiet elderly man, for whom it evidently had a\r\n",
      "fascination, often seated there in a maze or a doze; but half the\r\n",
      "satisfaction of the spot for this mysterious and fitful worshipper was\r\n",
      "that he found the years of his life there, and the ties, the affections,\r\n",
      "the struggles, the submissions, the conquests, if there had been such, a\r\n",
      "record of that adventurous journey in which the beginnings and the\r\n",
      "endings of human relations are the lettered mile-stones.  He had in\r\n",
      "general little taste for the past as a part of his own history; at other\r\n",
      "times and in other places it mostly seemed to him pitiful to consider and\r\n",
      "impossible to repair; but on these occasions he accepted it with\r\n",
      "something of that positive gladness with which one adjusts one's self to\r\n",
      "an ache that begins to succumb to treatment.  To the treatment of time\r\n",
      "the malady of life begins at a given moment to succumb; and these were\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "of differences imperceptible.  He knew his candles apart, up to the\r\n",
      "colour of the flame, and would still have known them had their positions\r\n",
      "all been changed.  To other imaginations they might stand for other\r\n",
      "things--that they should stand for something to be hushed before was all\r\n",
      "he desired; but he was intensely conscious of the personal note of each\r\n",
      "and of the distinguishable way it contributed to the concert.  There were\r\n",
      "hours at which he almost caught himself wishing that certain of his\r\n",

      "being forgotten than by being remembered.  The greatest blank in the\r\n",

      "took of it.  He had a strange sense of having come for something in\r\n",
      "particular; strange because literally there was nothing particular\r\n",

      "velvet and the fluted moreen; and though, as we know, he had the worship\r\n",

      "impossible for him either to offer her presents or contentedly to stay\r\n",

      "already told him she would make no change of scene.  He read the\r\n",
      "reference in the objects about her--the general one to places and times;\r\n",
      "but after a minute he distinguished among them a small portrait of a\r\n",
      "gentleman.  At a distance and without their glasses his eyes were only so\r\n",
      "caught by it as to feel a vague curiosity.  Presently this impulse\r\n",
      "carried him nearer, and in another moment he was staring at the picture\r\n",
      "in stupefaction and with the sense that some sound had broken from him.\r\n",

      "to take his own.  Nothing more wonderful had ever appeared to him than,\r\n",
      "in that little chamber of remembrance and homage, to see her convey with\r\n",
      "such exquisite mildness that as from Acton Hague any injury was credible.\r\n",
      "The clock ticked in the stillness--Hague had probably given it to\r\n",
      "her--and while he let her hold his hand with a tenderness that was almost\r\n",
      "an assumption of responsibility for his old pain as well as his new,\r\n",
      "Stransom after a minute broke out: \"Good God, how he must have used\r\n",

      "confession; which was presently, suddenly blushing red and changing her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You set up your altar, and when I wanted one most I found it\r\n",
      "magnificently ready.  I used it with the gratitude I've always shown you,\r\n",
      "for I knew it from of old to be dedicated to Death.  I told you long ago\r\n",
      "that my Dead weren't many.  Yours were, but all you had done for them was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"If I had known you had ever known him I should have taken for granted he\r\n",

      "was only a touch in the picture of that plasticity Stransom had supreme\r\n",
      "reason to know so great a master could have been trusted to produce.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This picture was for a while all our friend saw: he caught his breath\r\n",
      "again and again as it came over him that the woman with whom he had had\r\n",
      "for years so fine a point of contact was a woman whom Acton Hague, of all\r\n",
      "men in the world, had more or less fashioned.  Such as she sat there\r\n",
      "to-day she was ineffaceably stamped with him.  Beneficent, blameless as\r\n",
      "Stransom held her, he couldn't rid himself of the sense that he had been,\r\n",
      "as who should say, swindled.  She had imposed upon him hugely, though she\r\n",
      "had known it as little as he.  All this later past came back to him as a\r\n",
      "time grotesquely misspent.  Such at least were his first reflexions;\r\n",
      "after a while he found himself more divided and only, as the end of it,\r\n",
      "more troubled.  He imagined, recalled, reconstituted, figured out for\r\n",
      "himself the truth she had refused to give him; the effect of which was to\r\n",
      "make her seem to him only more saturated with her fate.  He felt her\r\n",
      "spirit, through the whole strangeness, finer than his own to the very\r\n",
      "degree in which she might have been, in which she certainly had been,\r\n",
      "more wronged.  A women, when wronged, was always more wronged than a man,\r\n",
      "and there were conditions when the least she could have got off with was\r\n",
      "more than the most he could have to bear.  He was sure this rare creature\r\n",
      "wouldn't have got off with the least.  He was awestruck at the thought of\r\n",
      "such a surrender--such a prostration.  Moulded indeed she had been by\r\n",
      "powerful hands, to have converted her injury into an exaltation so\r\n",
      "sublime.  The fellow had only had to die for everything that was ugly in\r\n",
      "him to be washed out in a torrent.  It was vain to try to guess what had\r\n",
      "taken place, but nothing could be clearer than that she had ended by\r\n",
      "accusing herself.  She absolved him at every point, she adored her very\r\n",
      "wounds.  The passion by which he had profited had rushed back after its\r\n",
      "ebb, and now the tide of tenderness, arrested for ever at flood, was too\r\n",
      "deep even to fathom.  Stransom sincerely considered that he had forgiven\r\n",
      "him; but how little he had achieved the miracle that she had achieved!\r\n",
      "His forgiveness was silence, but hers was mere unuttered sound.  The\r\n",
      "light she had demanded for his altar would have broken his silence with a\r\n",

      "hush.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had been right about the difference--she had spoken the truth about\r\n",
      "the change: Stransom was soon to know himself as perversely but sharply\r\n",
      "jealous.  _His_ tide had ebbed, not flowed; if he had \"forgiven\" Acton\r\n",
      "Hague, that forgiveness was a motive with a broken spring.  The very fact\r\n",
      "of her appeal for a material sign, a sign that should make her dead lover\r\n",
      "equal there with the others, presented the concession to her friend as\r\n",
      "too handsome for the case.  He had never thought of himself as hard, but\r\n",
      "an exorbitant article might easily render him so.  He moved round and\r\n",
      "round this one, but only in widening circles--the more he looked at it\r\n",
      "the less acceptable it seemed.  At the same time he had no illusion about\r\n",
      "the effect of his refusal; he perfectly saw how it would make for a\r\n",
      "rupture.  He left her alone a week, but when at last he again called this\r\n",
      "conviction was cruelly confirmed.  In the interval he had kept away from\r\n",
      "the church, and he needed no fresh assurance from her to know she hadn't\r\n",
      "entered it.  The change was complete enough: it had broken up her life.\r\n",
      "Indeed it had broken up his, for all the fires of his shrine seemed to\r\n",
      "him suddenly to have been quenched.  A great indifference fell upon him,\r\n",
      "the weight of which was in itself a pain; and he never knew what his\r\n",
      "devotion had been for him till in that shock it ceased like a dropped\r\n",
      "watch.  Neither did he know with how large a confidence he had counted on\r\n",
      "the final service that had now failed: the mortal deception was that in\r\n",
      "this abandonment the whole future gave way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These days of her absence proved to him of what she was capable; all the\r\n",
      "more that he never dreamed she was vindictive or even resentful.  It was\r\n",
      "not in anger she had forsaken him; it was in simple submission to hard\r\n",
      "reality, to the stern logic of life.  This came home to him when he sat\r\n",
      "with her again in the room in which her late aunt's conversation lingered\r\n",
      "like the tone of a cracked piano.  She tried to make him forget how much\r\n",
      "they were estranged, but in the very presence of what they had given up\r\n",
      "it was impossible not to be sorry for her.  He had taken from her so much\r\n",
      "more than she had taken from him.  He argued with her again, told her she\r\n",
      "could now have the altar to herself; but she only shook her head with\r\n",
      "pleading sadness, begging him not to waste his breath on the impossible,\r\n",
      "the extinct.  Couldn't he see that in relation to her private need the\r\n",
      "rites he had established were practically an elaborate exclusion?  She\r\n",
      "regretted nothing that had happened; it had all been right so long as she\r\n",
      "didn't know, and it was only that now she knew too much and that from the\r\n",
      "moment their eyes were open they would simply have to conform.  It had\r\n",
      "doubtless been happiness enough for them to go on together so long.  She\r\n",
      "was gentle, grateful, resigned; but this was only the form of a deep\r\n",
      "immoveability.  He saw he should never more cross the threshold of the\r\n",
      "second room, and he felt how much this alone would make a stranger of him\r\n",
      "and give a conscious stiffness to his visits.  He would have hated to\r\n",
      "plunge again into that well of reminders, but he enjoyed quite as little\r\n",
      "the vacant alternative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After he had been with her three or four times it struck him that to have\r\n",
      "come at last into her house had had the horrid effect of diminishing\r\n",
      "their intimacy.  He had known her better, had liked her in greater\r\n",
      "freedom, when they merely walked together or kneeled together.  Now they\r\n",
      "only pretended; before they had been nobly sincere.  They began to try\r\n",
      "their walks again, but it proved a lame imitation, for these things, from\r\n",
      "the first, beginning or ending, had been connected with their visits to\r\n",
      "the church.  They had either strolled away as they came out or gone in to\r\n",
      "rest on the return.  Stransom, besides, now faltered; he couldn't walk as\r\n",
      "of old.  The omission made everything false; it was a dire mutilation of\r\n",
      "their lives.  Our friend was frank and monotonous, making no mystery of\r\n",
      "his remonstrance and no secret of his predicament.  Her response,\r\n",
      "whatever it was, always came to the same thing--an implied invitation to\r\n",
      "him to judge, if he spoke of predicaments, of how much comfort she had in\r\n",
      "hers.  For him indeed was no comfort even in complaint, since every\r\n",
      "allusion to what had befallen them but made the author of their trouble\r\n",
      "more present.  Acton Hague was between them--that was the essence of the\r\n",
      "matter, and never so much between them as when they were face to face.\r\n",
      "Then Stransom, while still wanting to banish him, had the strangest sense\r\n",
      "of striving for an ease that would involve having accepted him.  Deeply\r\n",
      "disconcerted by what he knew, he was still worse tormented by really not\r\n",
      "knowing.  Perfectly aware that it would have been horribly vulgar to\r\n",
      "abuse his old friend or to tell his companion the story of their quarrel,\r\n",
      "it yet vexed him that her depth of reserve should give him no opening and\r\n",
      "should have the effect of a magnanimity greater even than his own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He challenged himself, denounced himself, asked himself if he were in\r\n",
      "love with her that he should care so much what adventures she had had.\r\n",
      "He had never for a moment allowed he was in love with her; therefore\r\n",
      "nothing could have surprised him more than to discover he was jealous.\r\n",
      "What but jealousy could give a man that sore contentious wish for the\r\n",
      "detail of what would make him suffer?  Well enough he knew indeed that he\r\n",
      "should never have it from the only person who to-day could give it to\r\n",
      "him.  She let him press her with his sombre eyes, only smiling at him\r\n",
      "with an exquisite mercy and breathing equally little the word that would\r\n",
      "expose her secret and the word that would appear to deny his literal\r\n",
      "right to bitterness.  She told nothing, she judged nothing; she accepted\r\n",
      "everything but the possibility of her return to the old symbols.\r\n",
      "Stransom divined that for her too they had been vividly individual, had\r\n",
      "stood for particular hours or particular attributes--particular links in\r\n",
      "her chain.  He made it clear to himself, as he believed, that his\r\n",
      "difficulty lay in the fact that the very nature of the plea for his\r\n",
      "faithless friend constituted a prohibition; that it happened to have come\r\n",
      "from _her_ was precisely the vice that attached to it.  To the voice of\r\n",
      "impersonal generosity he felt sure he would have listened; he would have\r\n",
      "deferred to an advocate who, speaking from abstract justice, knowing of\r\n",

      "being really so conceivable.  But even his faculty of analysis left the\r\n",

      "reached the age of renouncement; but it had not hitherto been vivid to\r\n",
      "him that it was time to give up everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Practically, at the end of six months, he had renounced the friendship\r\n",
      "once so charming and comforting.  His privation had two faces, and the\r\n",
      "face it had turned to him on the occasion of his last attempt to\r\n",

      "and giving voice to that inanity.  There was proof enough besides in his\r\n",
      "being so weak and so ill.  His irritation took the form of melancholy,\r\n",
      "and his melancholy that of the conviction that his health had quite\r\n",
      "failed.  His altar moreover had ceased to exist; his chapel, in his\r\n",
      "dreams, was a great dark cavern.  All the lights had gone out--all his\r\n",
      "Dead had died again.  He couldn't exactly see at first how it had been in\r\n",
      "the power of his late companion to extinguish them, since it was neither\r\n",
      "for her nor by her that they had been called into being.  Then he\r\n",
      "understood that it was essentially in his own soul the revival had taken\r\n",
      "place, and that in the air of this soul they were now unable to breathe.\r\n",
      "The candles might mechanically burn, but each of them had lost its\r\n",
      "lustre.  The church had become a void; it was his presence, her presence,\r\n",
      "their common presence, that had made the indispensable medium.  If\r\n",
      "anything was wrong everything was--her silence spoiled the tune.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then when three months were gone he felt so lonely that he went back;\r\n",
      "reflecting that as they had been his best society for years his Dead\r\n",
      "perhaps wouldn't let him forsake them without doing something more for\r\n",
      "him.  They stood there, as he had left them, in their tall radiance, the\r\n",
      "bright cluster that had already made him, on occasions when he was\r\n",
      "willing to compare small things with great, liken them to a group of\r\n",
      "sea-lights on the edge of the ocean of life.  It was a relief to him,\r\n",
      "after a while, as he sat there, to feel they had still a virtue.  He was\r\n",
      "more and more easily tired, and he always drove now; the action of his\r\n",
      "heart was weak and gave him none of the reassurance conferred by the\r\n",
      "action of his fancy.  None the less he returned yet again, returned\r\n",
      "several times, and finally, during six months, haunted the place with a\r\n",
      "renewal of frequency and a strain of impatience.  In winter the church\r\n",
      "was unwarmed and exposure to cold forbidden him, but the glow of his\r\n",
      "shrine was an influence in which he could almost bask.  He sat and\r\n",
      "wondered to what he had reduced his absent associate and what she now did\r\n",
      "with the hours of her absence.  There were other churches, there were\r\n",
      "other altars, there were other candles; in one way or another her piety\r\n",
      "would still operate; he couldn't absolutely have deprived her of her\r\n",
      "rites.  So he argued, but without contentment; for he well enough knew\r\n",
      "there was no other such rare semblance of the mountain of light she had\r\n",
      "once mentioned to him as the satisfaction of her need.  As this semblance\r\n",
      "again gradually grew great to him and his pious practice more regular, he\r\n",
      "found a sharper and sharper pang in the imagination of her darkness; for\r\n",
      "never so much as in these weeks had his rites been real, never had his\r\n",
      "gathered company seemed so to respond and even to invite.  He lost\r\n",
      "himself in the large lustre, which was more and more what he had from the\r\n",
      "first wished it to be--as dazzling as the vision of heaven in the mind of\r\n",
      "a child.  He wandered in the fields of light; he passed, among the tall\r\n",
      "tapers, from tier to tier, from fire to fire, from name to name, from the\r\n",
      "white intensity of one clear emblem, of one saved soul, to another.  It\r\n",
      "was in the quiet sense of having saved his souls that his deep strange\r\n",
      "instinct rejoiced.  This was no dim theological rescue, no boon of a\r\n",
      "contingent world; they were saved better than faith or works could save\r\n",
      "them, saved for the warm world they had shrunk_ _from dying to, for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "By this time he had survived all his friends; the last straight flame was\r\n",
      "three years old, there was no one to add to the list.  Over and over he\r\n",
      "called his roll, and it appeared to him compact and complete.  Where\r\n",
      "should he put in another, where, if there were no other objection, would\r\n",
      "it stand in its place in the rank?  He reflected, with a want of\r\n",
      "sincerity of which he was quite conscious, that it would be difficult to\r\n",
      "determine that place.  More and more, besides, face to face with his\r\n",
      "little legion, over endless histories, handling the empty shells and\r\n",
      "playing with the silence--more and more he could see that he had never\r\n",
      "introduced an alien.  He had had his great companions, his\r\n",
      "indulgences--there were cases in which they had been immense; but what\r\n",
      "had his devotion after all been if it hadn't been at bottom a respect?\r\n",
      "He was, however, himself surprised at his stiffness; by the end of the\r\n",
      "winter the responsibility of it was what was uppermost in his thoughts.\r\n",
      "The refrain had grown old to them, that plea for just one more.  There\r\n",
      "came a day when, for simple exhaustion, if symmetry should demand just\r\n",
      "one he was ready so far to meet symmetry.  Symmetry was harmony, and the\r\n",
      "idea of harmony began to haunt him; he said to himself that harmony was\r\n",
      "of course everything.  He took, in fancy, his composition to pieces,\r\n",
      "redistributing it into other lines, making other juxtapositions and\r\n",
      "contrasts.  He shifted this and that candle, he made the spaces\r\n",
      "different, he effaced the disfigurement of a possible gap.  There were\r\n",
      "subtle and complex relations, a scheme of cross-reference, and moments in\r\n",
      "which he seemed to catch a glimpse of the void so sensible to the woman\r\n",
      "who wandered in exile or sat where he had seen her with the portrait of\r\n",
      "Acton Hague.  Finally, in this way, he arrived at a conception of the\r\n",
      "total, the ideal, which left a clear opportunity for just another figure.\r\n",
      "\"Just one more--to round it off; just one more, just one,\" continued to\r\n",
      "hum in his head.  There was a strange confusion in the thought, for he\r\n",
      "felt the day to be near when he too should be one of the Others.  What in\r\n",
      "this event would the Others matter to him, since they only mattered to\r\n",
      "the living?  Even as one of the Dead what would his altar matter to him,\r\n",
      "since his particular dream of keeping it up had melted away?  What had\r\n",
      "harmony to do with the case if his lights were all to be quenched?  What\r\n",
      "he had hoped for was an instituted thing.  He might perpetuate it on some\r\n",
      "other pretext, but his special meaning would have dropped.  This meaning\r\n",
      "was to have lasted with the life of the one other person who understood\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In March he had an illness during which he spent a fortnight in bed, and\r\n",
      "when he revived a little he was told of two things that had happened.\r\n",
      "One was that a lady whose name was not known to the servants (she left\r\n",
      "none) had been three times to ask about him; the other was that in his\r\n",
      "sleep and on an occasion when his mind evidently wandered he was heard to\r\n",
      "murmur again and again: \"Just one more--just one.\"  As soon as he found\r\n",
      "himself able to go out, and before the doctor in attendance had\r\n",
      "pronounced him so, he drove to see the lady who had come to ask about\r\n",
      "him.  She was not at home; but this gave him the opportunity, before his\r\n",
      "strength should fall again, to take his way to the church.  He entered it\r\n",
      "alone; he had declined, in a happy manner he possessed of being able to\r\n",
      "decline effectively, the company of his servant or of a nurse.  He knew\r\n",
      "now perfectly what these good people thought; they had discovered his\r\n",
      "clandestine connexion, the magnet that had drawn him for so many years,\r\n",
      "and doubtless attached a significance of their own to the odd words they\r\n",
      "had repeated to him.  The nameless lady was the clandestine connexion--a\r\n",
      "fact nothing could have made clearer than his indecent haste to rejoin\r\n",
      "her.  He sank on his knees before his altar while his head fell over on\r\n",
      "his hands.  His weakness, his life's weariness overtook him.  It seemed\r\n",
      "to him he had come for the great surrender.  At first he asked himself\r\n",
      "how he should get away; then, with the failing belief in the power, the\r\n",
      "very desire to move gradually left him.  He had come, as he always came,\r\n",
      "to lose himself; the fields of light were still there to stray in; only\r\n",
      "this time, in straying, he would never come back.  He had given himself\r\n",
      "to his Dead, and it was good: this time his Dead would keep him.  He\r\n",
      "couldn't rise from his knees; he believed he should never rise again; all\r\n",
      "he could do was to lift his face and fix his eyes on his lights.  They\r\n",
      "looked unusually, strangely splendid, but the one that always drew him\r\n",
      "most had an unprecedented lustre.  It was the central voice of the choir,\r\n",
      "the glowing heart of the brightness, and on this occasion it seemed to\r\n",
      "expand, to spread great wings of flame.  The whole altar flared--dazzling\r\n",
      "and blinding; but the source of the vast radiance burned clearer than the\r\n",
      "rest, gathering itself into form, and the form was human beauty and human\r\n",
      "charity, was the far-off face of Mary Antrim.  She smiled at him from the\r\n",
      "glory of heaven--she brought the glory down with her to take him.  He\r\n",
      "bowed his head in submission and at the same moment another wave rolled\r\n",
      "over him.  Was it the quickening of joy to pain?  In the midst of his joy\r\n",
      "at any rate he felt his buried face grow hot as with some communicated\r\n",
      "knowledge that had the force of a reproach.  It suddenly made him\r\n",
      "contrast that very rapture with the bliss he had refused to another.\r\n",
      "This breath of the passion immortal was all that other had asked; the\r\n",
      "descent of Mary Antrim opened his spirit with a great compunctious throb\r\n",
      "for the descent of Acton Hague.  It was as if Stransom had read what her\r\n",
      "eyes said to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a moment he looked round in a despair that made him feel as if the\r\n",
      "source of life were ebbing.  The church had been empty--he was alone; but\r\n",
      "he wanted to have something done, to make a last appeal.  This idea gave\r\n",
      "him strength for an effort; he rose to his feet with a movement that made\r\n",
      "him turn, supporting himself by the back of a bench.  Behind him was a\r\n",
      "prostrate figure, a figure he had seen before; a woman in deep mourning,\r\n",
      "bowed in grief or in prayer.  He had seen her in other days--the first\r\n",
      "time of his entrance there, and he now slightly wavered, looking at her\r\n",
      "again till she seemed aware he had noticed her.  She raised her head and\r\n",
      "met his eyes: the partner of his long worship had come back.  She looked\r\n",
      "across at him an instant with a face wondering and scared; he saw he had\r\n",
      "made her afraid.  Then quickly rising she came straight to him with both\r\n",
      "hands out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you _could_ come?  God sent you!\" he murmured with a happy smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're very ill--you shouldn't be here,\" she urged in anxious reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"God sent me too, I think.  I was ill when I came, but the sight of you\r\n",
      "does wonders.\"  He held her hands, which steadied and quickened him.\r\n",
      "\"I've something to tell you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't tell me!\" she tenderly pleaded; \"let me tell you.  This afternoon,\r\n",
      "by a miracle, the sweetest of miracles, the sense of our difference left\r\n",
      "me.  I was out--I was near, thinking, wandering alone, when, on the spot,\r\n",
      "something changed in my heart.  It's my confession--there it is.  To come\r\n",
      "back, to come back on the instant--the idea gave me wings.  It was as if\r\n",
      "I suddenly saw something--as if it all became possible.  I could come for\r\n",
      "what you yourself came for: that was enough.  So here I am.  It's not for\r\n",
      "my own--that's over.  But I'm here for _them_.\"  And breathless,\r\n",
      "infinitely relieved by her low precipitate explanation, she looked with\r\n",
      "eyes that reflected all its splendour at the magnificence of their altar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're here for you,\" Stransom said, \"they're present to-night as\r\n",
      "they've never been.  They speak for you--don't you see?--in a passion of\r\n",
      "light; they sing out like a choir of angels.  Don't you hear what they\r\n",
      "say?--they offer the very thing you asked of me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't talk of it--don't think of it; forget it!\"  She spoke in hushed\r\n",
      "supplication, and while the alarm deepened in her eyes she disengaged one\r\n",
      "of her hands and passed an arm round him to support him better, to help\r\n",
      "him to sink into a seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He let himself go, resting on her; he dropped upon the bench and she fell\r\n",
      "on her knees beside him, his own arm round her shoulder.  So he remained\r\n",
      "an instant, staring up at his shrine.  \"They say there's a gap in the\r\n",
      "array--they say it's not full, complete.  Just one more,\" he went on,\r\n",
      "softly--\"isn't that what you wanted?  Yes, one more, one more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah no more--no more!\" she wailed, as with a quick new horror of it,\r\n",
      "under her breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, one more,\" he repeated, simply; \"just one!\"  And with this his head\r\n",
      "dropped on her shoulder; she felt that in his weakness he had fainted.\r\n",
      "But alone with him in the dusky church a great dread was on her of what\r\n",
      "might still happen, for his face had the whiteness of death.\r\n",

      "The story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but\r\n",
      "except the obvious remark that it was gruesome, as, on Christmas eve\r\n",
      "in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I remember no\r\n",
      "comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case\r\n",
      "he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. The case,\r\n",
      "I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as\r\n",
      "had gathered us for the occasion--an appearance, of a dreadful kind,\r\n",
      "to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up\r\n",
      "in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe\r\n",
      "him to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had\r\n",
      "succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this\r\n",
      "observation that drew from Douglas--not immediately, but later in the\r\n",
      "evening--a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call\r\n",
      "attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which\r\n",
      "I saw he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself\r\n",
      "something to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in\r\n",
      "fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered,\r\n",
      "he brought out what was in his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I quite agree--in regard to Griffin's ghost, or whatever it\r\n",
      "was--that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age,\r\n",
      "adds a particular touch. But it's not the first occurrence of its\r\n",
      "charming kind that I know to have involved a child. If the child\r\n",
      "gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to _two_\r\n",
      "children----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We say, of course,\" somebody exclaimed, \"that they give two\r\n",
      "turns! Also that we want to hear about them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to\r\n",
      "present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands\r\n",
      "in his pockets. \"Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It's\r\n",
      "quite too horrible.\" This, naturally, was declared by several voices\r\n",
      "to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art,\r\n",
      "prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going\r\n",
      "on: \"It's beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know touches\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For sheer terror?\" I remember asking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss\r\n",
      "how to qualify it. He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little\r\n",
      "wincing grimace. \"For dreadful--dreadfulness!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, how delicious!\" cried one of the women.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me,\r\n",
      "he saw what he spoke of. \"For general uncanny ugliness and horror and\r\n",
      "pain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then,\" I said, \"just sit right down and begin.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an\r\n",
      "instant. Then as he faced us again: \"I can't begin. I shall have\r\n",
      "to send to town.\" There was a unanimous groan at this, and much\r\n",
      "reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. \"The\r\n",
      "story's written. It's in a locked drawer--it has not been out for\r\n",
      "years. I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send\r\n",
      "down the packet as he finds it.\" It was to me in particular that\r\n",
      "he appeared to propound this--appeared almost to appeal for aid not\r\n",
      "to hesitate. He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many\r\n",
      "a winter; had had his reasons for a long silence. The others resented\r\n",
      "postponement, but it was just his scruples that charmed me. I adjured\r\n",
      "him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early\r\n",
      "hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his\r\n",
      "own. To this his answer was prompt. \"Oh, thank God, no!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And is the record yours? You took the thing down?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing but the impression. I took that _here_\"--he tapped his\r\n",
      "heart. \"I've never lost it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then your manuscript----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.\" He hung\r\n",
      "fire again. \"A woman's. She has been dead these twenty years. She\r\n",
      "sent me the pages in question before she died.\" They were all\r\n",
      "listening now, and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any\r\n",
      "rate to draw the inference. But if he put the inference by without\r\n",
      "a smile it was also without irritation. \"She was a most charming\r\n",
      "person, but she was ten years older than I. She was my sister's\r\n",
      "governess,\" he quietly said. \"She was the most agreeable woman\r\n",
      "I've ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any\r\n",
      "whatever. It was long ago, and this episode was long before. I was at\r\n",
      "Trinity, and I found her at home on my coming down the second summer. I\r\n",
      "was much there that year--it was a beautiful one; and we had, in her\r\n",
      "off-hours, some strolls and talks in the garden--talks in which she\r\n",
      "struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes; don't grin: I liked\r\n",
      "her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me too. If\r\n",
      "she hadn't she wouldn't have told me. She had never told anyone. It\r\n",
      "wasn't simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn't. I was\r\n",
      "sure; I could see. You'll easily judge why when you hear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because the thing had been such a scare?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He continued to fix me. \"You'll easily judge,\" he repeated:\r\n",
      "\"_you_ will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I fixed him too. \"I see. She was in love.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed for the first time. \"You _are_ acute. Yes, she was in\r\n",
      "love. That is, she had been. That came out--she couldn't tell her\r\n",
      "story without its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but\r\n",
      "neither of us spoke of it. I remember the time and the place--the\r\n",
      "corner of the lawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot\r\n",
      "summer afternoon. It wasn't a scene for a shudder; but oh----!\" He\r\n",
      "quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll receive the packet Thursday morning?\" I inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Probably not till the second post.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then; after dinner----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll all meet me here?\" He looked us round again. \"Isn't\r\n",
      "anybody going?\" It was almost the tone of hope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everybody will stay!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_I_ will--and _I_ will!\" cried the ladies whose departure had\r\n",
      "been fixed. Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more\r\n",
      "light. \"Who was it she was in love with?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The story will tell,\" I took upon myself to reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I can't wait for the story!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The story _won't_ tell,\" said Douglas; \"not in any literal,\r\n",
      "vulgar way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"More's the pity, then. That's the only way I ever understand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Won't _you_ tell, Douglas?\" somebody else inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sprang to his feet again. \"Yes--tomorrow. Now I must go to\r\n",
      "bed. Good-night.\" And quickly catching up a candlestick, he left us\r\n",
      "slightly bewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his\r\n",
      "step on the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. \"Well, if I don't\r\n",
      "know who she was in love with, I know who _he_ was.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She was ten years older,\" said her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Raison de plus_--at that age! But it's rather nice, his long\r\n",
      "reticence.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Forty years!\" Griffin put in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With this outbreak at last.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The outbreak,\" I returned, \"will make a tremendous occasion of\r\n",
      "Thursday night;\" and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of\r\n",
      "it, we lost all attention for everything else. The last story, however\r\n",
      "incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we\r\n",
      "handshook and \"candlestuck,\" as somebody said, and went to bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I knew the next day that a letter containing the key had, by the first\r\n",
      "post, gone off to his London apartments; but in spite of--or perhaps\r\n",
      "just on account of--the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite\r\n",
      "let him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening,\r\n",
      "in fact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our\r\n",
      "hopes were fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire\r\n",
      "and indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him\r\n",
      "again before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of\r\n",
      "the previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised\r\n",
      "to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of\r\n",
      "prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this\r\n",
      "narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what\r\n",
      "I shall presently give. Poor Douglas, before his death--when it was in\r\n",
      "sight--committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of\r\n",
      "these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began\r\n",
      "to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The\r\n",
      "departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't, of course,\r\n",
      "thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made,\r\n",
      "in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with\r\n",
      "which he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final\r\n",
      "auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to\r\n",
      "a common thrill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took\r\n",
      "up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to\r\n",
      "be in possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of\r\n",
      "several daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty,\r\n",
      "on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to\r\n",
      "London, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had\r\n",
      "already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This\r\n",
      "person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house\r\n",
      "in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing--this\r\n",
      "prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life,\r\n",
      "such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel,\r\n",
      "before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could\r\n",
      "easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome\r\n",
      "and bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind. He struck her,\r\n",
      "inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and\r\n",
      "gave her the courage she afterwards showed was that he put the whole\r\n",
      "thing to her as a kind of favour, an obligation he should gratefully\r\n",
      "incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant--saw him\r\n",
      "all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of\r\n",
      "charming ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house\r\n",
      "filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it\r\n",
      "was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished\r\n",
      "her immediately to proceed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to\r\n",
      "a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military\r\n",
      "brother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were,\r\n",
      "by the strangest of chances for a man in his position,--a lone man\r\n",
      "without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience,--very\r\n",
      "heavily on his hands. It had all been a great worry and, on his own\r\n",
      "part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor\r\n",
      "chicks and had done all he could; had in particular sent them down to\r\n",
      "his other house, the proper place for them being of course the country,\r\n",
      "and kept them there, from the first, with the best people he could\r\n",
      "find to look after them, parting even with his own servants to wait\r\n",
      "on them and going down himself, whenever he might, to see how they\r\n",
      "were doing. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other\r\n",
      "relations and that his own affairs took up all his time. He had put\r\n",
      "them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed\r\n",
      "at the head of their little establishment--but below stairs only--an\r\n",
      "excellent woman, Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like\r\n",
      "and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper\r\n",
      "and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little girl,\r\n",
      "of whom, without children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely\r\n",
      "fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young\r\n",
      "lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority. She\r\n",
      "would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been\r\n",
      "for a term at school--young as he was to be sent, but what else could\r\n",
      "be done?--and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back\r\n",
      "from one day to the other. There had been for the two children at first\r\n",
      "a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done\r\n",
      "for them quite beautifully--she was a most respectable person--till\r\n",
      "her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no\r\n",
      "alternative but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since then,\r\n",
      "in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for Flora; and\r\n",
      "there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony,\r\n",
      "an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise thoroughly respectable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So far had Douglas presented his picture when someone put a\r\n",
      "question. \"And what did the former governess die of?--of so much\r\n",
      "respectability?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our friend's answer was prompt. \"That will come out. I don't\r\n",
      "anticipate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Excuse me--I thought that was just what you _are_ doing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In her successor's place,\" I suggested, \"I should have wished\r\n",
      "to learn if the office brought with it----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Necessary danger to life?\" Douglas completed my thought. \"She\r\n",
      "did wish to learn, and she did learn. You shall hear tomorrow\r\n",
      "what she learnt. Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as\r\n",
      "slightly grim. She was young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of\r\n",
      "serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness. She\r\n",
      "hesitated--took a couple of days to consult and consider. But the\r\n",
      "salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second\r\n",
      "interview she faced the music, she engaged.\" And Douglas, with this,\r\n",
      "made a pause that, for the benefit of the company, moved me to throw\r\n",
      "in--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the\r\n",
      "splendid young man. She succumbed to it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got up and, as he had done the night before, went to the fire, gave\r\n",
      "a stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to\r\n",
      "us. \"She saw him only twice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little to my surprise, on this, Douglas turned round to me. \"It\r\n",
      "_was_ the beauty of it. There were others,\" he went on, \"who\r\n",
      "hadn't succumbed. He told her frankly all his difficulty--that for\r\n",
      "several applicants the conditions had been prohibitive. They were,\r\n",
      "somehow, simply afraid. It sounded dull--it sounded strange; and all\r\n",
      "the more so because of his main condition.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Which was----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That she should never trouble him--but never, never: neither appeal\r\n",
      "nor complain nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself,\r\n",
      "receive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and\r\n",
      "let him alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that\r\n",
      "when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking\r\n",
      "her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But was that all her reward?\" one of the ladies asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She never saw him again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us\r\n",
      "again, was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject\r\n",
      "till, the next night, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair,\r\n",
      "he opened the faded red cover of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged\r\n",
      "album. The whole thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the\r\n",
      "first occasion the same lady put another question. \"What is your\r\n",
      "title?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I haven't one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, _I_ have!\" I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, had begun\r\n",
      "to read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of\r\n",
      "the beauty of his author's hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops,\r\n",
      "a little see-saw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising,\r\n",
      "in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very\r\n",
      "bad days--found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made\r\n",
      "a mistake. In this state of mind I spent the long hours of bumping,\r\n",
      "swinging coach that carried me to the stopping-place at which I was\r\n",
      "to be met by a vehicle from the house. This convenience, I was told,\r\n",
      "had been ordered, and I found, toward the close of the June afternoon,\r\n",
      "a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely\r\n",
      "day, through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me\r\n",
      "a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into\r\n",
      "the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the\r\n",
      "point to which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded,\r\n",
      "something so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I\r\n",
      "remember as a most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its\r\n",
      "open windows and fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out;\r\n",
      "I remember the lawn and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels\r\n",
      "on the gravel and the clustered treetops over which the rooks circled\r\n",
      "and cawed in the golden sky. The scene had a greatness that made it a\r\n",
      "different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately appeared\r\n",
      "at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who dropped\r\n",
      "me as decent a curtsey as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished\r\n",
      "visitor. I had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the\r\n",
      "place, and that, as I recalled it, made me think the proprietor still\r\n",
      "more of a gentleman, suggested that what I was to enjoy might be\r\n",
      "something beyond his promise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had no drop again till the next day, for I was carried triumphantly\r\n",
      "through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my\r\n",
      "pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on\r\n",
      "the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have\r\n",
      "to do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen,\r\n",
      "and I afterwards wondered that my employer had not told me more of\r\n",
      "her. I slept little that night--I was too much excited; and this\r\n",
      "astonished me too, I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense\r\n",
      "of the liberality with which I was treated. The large, impressive room,\r\n",
      "one of the best in the house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it,\r\n",
      "the full, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first\r\n",
      "time, I could see myself from head to foot, all struck me--like the\r\n",
      "extraordinary charm of my small charge--as so many things thrown in. It\r\n",
      "was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should get on with\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear\r\n",
      "I had rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook\r\n",
      "might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being\r\n",
      "so glad to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so\r\n",
      "glad--stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman--as to be positively\r\n",
      "on her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little\r\n",
      "why she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with\r\n",
      "suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection\r\n",
      "with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl,\r\n",
      "the vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything\r\n",
      "else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several\r\n",
      "times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and\r\n",
      "prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look\r\n",
      "at such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to\r\n",
      "listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter,\r\n",
      "for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not\r\n",
      "without, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a\r\n",
      "moment when I believed I recognised, faint and far, the cry of a child;\r\n",
      "there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as\r\n",
      "at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies\r\n",
      "were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the\r\n",
      "light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent\r\n",
      "matters that they now come back to me. To watch, teach, \"form\"\r\n",
      "little Flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful\r\n",
      "life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first\r\n",
      "occasion I should have her as a matter of course at night, her small\r\n",
      "white bed being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had\r\n",
      "undertaken was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this\r\n",
      "last time, with Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for\r\n",
      "my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this\r\n",
      "timidity--which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world,\r\n",
      "had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign\r\n",
      "of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed\r\n",
      "of one of Raphael's holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to\r\n",
      "her and to determine us--I felt quite sure she would presently like\r\n",
      "me. It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the\r\n",
      "pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at\r\n",
      "supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a\r\n",
      "bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were\r\n",
      "naturally things that in Flora's presence could pass between us only\r\n",
      "as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the little boy--does he look like her? Is he too so very\r\n",
      "remarkable?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One wouldn't flatter a child. \"Oh, Miss, _most_ remarkable. If you\r\n",
      "think well of this one!\"--and she stood there with a plate in her\r\n",
      "hand, beaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other\r\n",
      "with placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; if I do----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You _will_ be carried away by the little gentleman!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that, I think, is what I came for--to be carried away. I'm\r\n",
      "afraid, however,\" I remember feeling the impulse to add, \"I'm\r\n",
      "rather easily carried away. I was carried away in London!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can still see Mrs. Grose's broad face as she took this in. \"In\r\n",
      "Harley Street?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In Harley Street.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Miss, you're not the first--and you won't be the last.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I've no pretension,\" I could laugh, \"to being the only\r\n",
      "one. My other pupil, at any rate, as I understand, comes back\r\n",
      "tomorrow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not tomorrow--Friday, Miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach,\r\n",
      "under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and\r\n",
      "friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public\r\n",
      "conveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an\r\n",
      "idea in which Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow took\r\n",
      "her manner as a kind of comforting pledge--never falsified, thank\r\n",
      "heaven!--that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was\r\n",
      "glad I was there!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I felt the next day was, I suppose, nothing that could be fairly\r\n",
      "called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at\r\n",
      "the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of\r\n",
      "the scale, as I walked round them, gazed up at them, took them in,\r\n",
      "of my new circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and mass for\r\n",
      "which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found\r\n",
      "myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. Lessons,\r\n",
      "in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that\r\n",
      "my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the\r\n",
      "child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out of\r\n",
      "doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should\r\n",
      "be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by\r\n",
      "step and room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful,\r\n",
      "childish talk about it and with the result, in half an hour, of our\r\n",
      "becoming immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout\r\n",
      "our little tour, with her confidence and courage with the way, in\r\n",
      "empty chambers and dull corridors, on crooked staircases that made\r\n",
      "me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower\r\n",
      "that made me dizzy, her morning music, her disposition to tell me so\r\n",
      "many more things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not\r\n",
      "seen Bly since the day I left it, and I dare say that to my older and\r\n",
      "more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as\r\n",
      "my little conductress, with her hair of gold and her frock of blue,\r\n",
      "danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, I had the\r\n",
      "view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as\r\n",
      "would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all colour out of\r\n",
      "storybooks and fairy-tales. Wasn't it just a storybook over which\r\n",
      "I had fallen a-doze and a-dream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique,\r\n",
      "but convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still\r\n",
      "older, half replaced and half utilised, in which I had the fancy of\r\n",
      "our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting\r\n",
      "ship. Well, I was, strangely, at the helm!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with Flora\r\n",
      "to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all the\r\n",
      "more for an incident that, presenting itself the second evening,\r\n",
      "had deeply disconcerted me. The first day had been, on the whole,\r\n",
      "as I have expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen\r\n",
      "apprehension. The postbag, that evening,--it came late,--contained a\r\n",
      "letter for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found\r\n",
      "to be composed but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to\r\n",
      "himself, with a seal still unbroken. \"This, I recognise, is from the\r\n",
      "head-master, and the head-master's an awful bore. Read him, please;\r\n",
      "deal with him; but mind you don't report. Not a word. I'm off!\"\r\n",
      "I broke the seal with a great effort--so great a one that I was a long\r\n",
      "time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room\r\n",
      "and only attacked it just before going to bed. I had better have let\r\n",
      "it wait till morning, for it gave me a second sleepless night. With no\r\n",
      "counsel to take, the next day, I was full of distress; and it finally\r\n",
      "got so the better of me that I determined to open myself at least to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What does it mean? The child's dismissed his school.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with\r\n",
      "a quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. \"But aren't they\r\n",
      "all----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sent home--yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back\r\n",
      "at all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. \"They won't take\r\n",
      "him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They absolutely decline.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; I saw them\r\n",
      "fill with good tears. \"What has he done?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hesitated; then I judged best simply to hand her my letter--which,\r\n",
      "however, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put\r\n",
      "her hands behind her. She shook her head sadly. \"Such things are not\r\n",
      "for me, Miss.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My counsellor couldn't read! I winced at my mistake, which I\r\n",
      "attenuated as I could, and opened my letter again to repeat it to her;\r\n",
      "then, faltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back\r\n",
      "in my pocket. \"Is he really _bad_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tears were still in her eyes. \"Do the gentlemen say so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that\r\n",
      "it should be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what\r\n",
      "this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some\r\n",
      "coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went\r\n",
      "on: \"That he's an injury to the others.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly\r\n",
      "flamed up. \"Master Miles! _him_ an injury?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet\r\n",
      "seen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the\r\n",
      "idea. I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the\r\n",
      "spot, sarcastically. \"To his poor little innocent mates!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's too dreadful,\" cried Mrs. Grose, \"to say such cruel\r\n",
      "things! Why, he's scarce ten years old.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes; it would be incredible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was evidently grateful for such a profession. \"See him, Miss,\r\n",
      "first. _Then_ believe it!\" I felt forthwith a new impatience to\r\n",
      "see him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next\r\n",
      "hours, was to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could\r\n",
      "judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up with\r\n",
      "assurance. \"You might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless\r\n",
      "her,\" she added the next moment--\"_look_ at her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes before, I had\r\n",
      "established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil,\r\n",
      "and a copy of nice \"round O's,\" now presented herself to view\r\n",
      "at the open door. She expressed in her little way an extraordinary\r\n",
      "detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a\r\n",
      "great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the\r\n",
      "affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary\r\n",
      "that she should follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel the\r\n",
      "full force of Mrs. Grose's comparison, and, catching my pupil in my\r\n",
      "arms, covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "None the less, the rest of the day, I watched for further occasion\r\n",
      "to approach my colleague, especially as, toward evening, I began to\r\n",
      "fancy she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on\r\n",
      "the staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her,\r\n",
      "holding her there with a hand on her arm. \"I take what you said to me\r\n",
      "at noon as a declaration that _you've_ never known him to be bad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very\r\n",
      "honestly, adopted an attitude. \"Oh, never known him--I don't\r\n",
      "pretend _that_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was upset again. \"Then you _have_ known him----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes indeed, Miss, thank God!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On reflection I accepted this. \"You mean that a boy who never\r\n",
      "is----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is no boy for _me_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I held her tighter. \"You like them with the spirit to be naughty?\"\r\n",
      "Then, keeping pace with her answer, \"So do I!\" I eagerly brought\r\n",
      "out. \"But not to the degree to contaminate----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To contaminate?\"--my big word left her at a loss. I explained\r\n",
      "it. \"To corrupt.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced in her an odd\r\n",
      "laugh. \"Are you afraid he'll corrupt _you_?\" She put the\r\n",
      "question with such a fine bold humour that, with a laugh, a little\r\n",
      "silly doubtless, to match her own, I gave way for the time to the\r\n",
      "apprehension of ridicule.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, I cropped up in\r\n",
      "another place. \"What was the lady who was here before?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The last governess? She was also young and pretty--almost as young\r\n",
      "and almost as pretty, Miss, even as you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!\" I recollect\r\n",
      "throwing off. \"He seems to like us young and pretty!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, he _did_,\" Mrs. Grose assented: \"it was the way he liked\r\n",
      "everyone!\" She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself\r\n",
      "up. \"I mean that's _his_ way--the master's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was struck. \"But of whom did you speak first?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked blank, but she coloured. \"Why, of _him_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of the master?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of who else?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was so obviously no one else that the next moment I had lost my\r\n",
      "impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and I\r\n",
      "merely asked what I wanted to know. \"Did _she_ see anything in the\r\n",
      "boy----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That wasn't right? She never told me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had a scruple, but I overcame it. \"Was she careful--particular?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious. \"About some\r\n",
      "things--yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But not about all?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again she considered. \"Well, Miss--she's gone. I won't tell\r\n",
      "tales.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I quite understand your feeling,\" I hastened to reply; but I\r\n",
      "thought it, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue:\r\n",
      "\"Did she die here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--she went off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I don't know what there was in this brevity of Mrs. Grose's that\r\n",
      "struck me as ambiguous. \"Went off to die?\" Mrs. Grose looked\r\n",
      "straight out of the window, but I felt that, hypothetically, I had\r\n",
      "a right to know what young persons engaged for Bly were expected to\r\n",
      "do. \"She was taken ill, you mean, and went home?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She\r\n",
      "left it, at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short\r\n",
      "holiday, to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a\r\n",
      "right. We had then a young woman--a nursemaid who had stayed on and\r\n",

      "monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had\r\n",
      "now been revealed to me should be under an interdict. I was a little\r\n",

      "freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from\r\n",

      "little air of knowing nothing in the world but love. It would have been\r\n",
      "impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence,\r\n",

      "bewildered--so far, that is, as I was not outraged--by the sense of the\r\n",
      "horrible letter locked up in my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could\r\n",
      "compass a private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her that it was\r\n",

      "extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort. I\r\n",
      "was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity. I found\r\n",
      "it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit,\r\n",
      "to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education for the world\r\n",
      "was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to remember at\r\n",
      "this day what proposal I framed for the end of his holidays and the\r\n",
      "resumption of his studies. Lessons with me, indeed, that charming\r\n",
      "summer, we all had a theory that he was to have; but I now feel\r\n",
      "that, for weeks, the lessons must have been rather my own. I learnt\r\n",
      "something--at first certainly--that had not been one of the teachings\r\n",
      "of my small, smothered life; learnt to be amused, and even amusing,\r\n",
      "and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in a manner,\r\n",
      "that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of summer\r\n",
      "and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration--and\r\n",
      "consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap--not designed, but deep--to\r\n",
      "my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever,\r\n",
      "in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say\r\n",
      "that I was off my guard. They gave me so little trouble--they were of\r\n",
      "a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to speculate--but even this with\r\n",
      "a dim disconnectedness--as to how the rough future (for all futures are\r\n",
      "rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. They had the bloom of\r\n",
      "health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair\r\n",
      "of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything,\r\n",
      "to be right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form\r\n",
      "that, in my fancy, the after-years could take for them was that of a\r\n",
      "romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park. It may\r\n",
      "be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke into this gives\r\n",
      "the previous time a charm of stillness--that hush in which something\r\n",
      "gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the spring of a\r\n",
      "beast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest,\r\n",
      "gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils,\r\n",
      "tea-time and bed-time having come and gone, I had, before my final\r\n",
      "retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions,\r\n",

      "lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed\r\n",
      "sky, from the old trees--I could take a turn into the grounds and\r\n",
      "enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me,\r\n",
      "the beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments\r\n",
      "to feel myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to\r\n",
      "reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high\r\n",
      "propriety, I was giving pleasure--if he ever thought of it!--to the\r\n",
      "person to whose pressure I had responded. What I was doing was what he\r\n",
      "had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me, and that I _could_, after\r\n",
      "all, do it proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I dare say\r\n",
      "I fancied myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort\r\n",
      "in the faith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to\r\n",
      "be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently\r\n",
      "gave their first sign.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of my very hour: the\r\n",
      "children were tucked away and I had come out for my stroll. One of the\r\n",
      "thoughts that, as I don't in the least shrink now from noting, used\r\n",
      "to be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming\r\n",
      "as a charming story suddenly to meet someone. Someone would appear\r\n",
      "there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and\r\n",
      "approve. I didn't ask more than that--I only asked that he should\r\n",
      "_know_; and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and\r\n",
      "the kind light of it, in his handsome face. That was exactly present\r\n",
      "to me--by which I mean the face was--when, on the first of these\r\n",
      "occasions, at the end of a long June day, I stopped short on emerging\r\n",
      "from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house. What\r\n",
      "arrested me on the spot--and with a shock much greater than any vision\r\n",
      "had allowed for--was the sense that my imagination had, in a flash,\r\n",
      "turned real. He did stand there!--but high up, beyond the lawn and at\r\n",
      "the very top of the tower to which, on that first morning, little Flora\r\n",
      "had conducted me. This tower was one of a pair--square, incongruous,\r\n",
      "crenelated structures--that were distinguished, for some reason, though\r\n",
      "I could see little difference, as the new and the old. They flanked\r\n",
      "opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities,\r\n",
      "redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a\r\n",
      "height too pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a\r\n",
      "romantic revival that was already a respectable past. I admired them,\r\n",
      "had fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially\r\n",
      "when they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual\r\n",
      "battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had\r\n",
      "so often invoked seemed most in place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two\r\n",
      "distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first\r\n",
      "and that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of\r\n",
      "the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person\r\n",
      "I had precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment\r\n",
      "of vision of which, after these years, there is no living view that\r\n",
      "I can hope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted\r\n",
      "object of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that\r\n",
      "faced me was--a few more seconds assured me--as little anyone else I\r\n",
      "knew as it was the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it\r\n",
      "in Harley Street--I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in\r\n",
      "the strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very\r\n",
      "fact of its appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my\r\n",
      "statement here with a deliberation with which I have never made it,\r\n",
      "the whole feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took\r\n",
      "in--what I did take in--all the rest of the scene had been stricken\r\n",
      "with death. I can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the\r\n",
      "sounds of evening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky\r\n",
      "and the friendly hour lost, for the minute, all its voice. But there\r\n",
      "was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that\r\n",
      "I saw with a stranger sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the\r\n",
      "clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements\r\n",
      "was as definite as a picture in a frame. That's how I thought,\r\n",
      "with extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been\r\n",
      "and that he was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long\r\n",
      "enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel,\r\n",
      "as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instants\r\n",
      "more became intense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The great question, or one of these, is, afterwards, I know,\r\n",
      "with regard to certain matters, the question of how long they\r\n",
      "have lasted. Well, this matter of mine, think what you will of it,\r\n",
      "lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities, none of which made\r\n",
      "a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been\r\n",
      "in the house--and for how long, above all?--a person of whom I was in\r\n",
      "ignorance. It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that\r\n",
      "my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such\r\n",
      "person. It lasted while this visitant, at all events,--and there was a\r\n",
      "touch of the strange freedom, as I remember, in the sign of familiarity\r\n",
      "of his wearing no hat,--seemed to fix me, from his position, with just\r\n",
      "the question, just the scrutiny through the fading light, that his own\r\n",
      "presence provoked. We were too far apart to call to each other, but\r\n",
      "there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some challenge between\r\n",
      "us, breaking the hush, would have been the right result of our straight\r\n",
      "mutual stare. He was in one of the angles, the one away from the house,\r\n",
      "very erect, as it struck me, and with both hands on the ledge. So\r\n",
      "I saw him as I see the letters I form on this page; then, exactly,\r\n",
      "after a minute, as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly changed\r\n",
      "his place--passed, looking at me hard all the while, to the opposite\r\n",
      "corner of the platform. Yes, I had the sharpest sense that during this\r\n",
      "transit he never took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment\r\n",
      "the way his hand, as he went, passed from one of the crenelations to\r\n",
      "the next. He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as\r\n",
      "he turned away still markedly fixed me. He turned away; that was all\r\n",
      "I knew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "IV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not that I didn't wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was\r\n",
      "rooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a \"secret\" at Bly--a\r\n",
      "mystery of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in\r\n",
      "unsuspected confinement? I can't say how long I turned it over,\r\n",
      "or how long, in a confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where\r\n",
      "I had had my collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house\r\n",
      "darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had\r\n",
      "held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have\r\n",
      "walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed\r\n",
      "that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The\r\n",
      "most singular part of it in fact--singular as the rest had been--was\r\n",
      "the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This\r\n",
      "picture comes back to me in the general train--the impression, as I\r\n",
      "received it on my return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in\r\n",
      "the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good\r\n",
      "surprised look of my friend, which immediately told me she had missed\r\n",
      "me. It came to me straightway, under her contact, that, with plain\r\n",
      "heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing\r\n",
      "whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. I\r\n",
      "had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me\r\n",
      "up, and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus\r\n",
      "finding myself hesitate to mention it. Scarce anything in the whole\r\n",
      "history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear\r\n",
      "was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On\r\n",
      "the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me,\r\n",
      "I, for a reason that I couldn't then have phrased, achieved an inward\r\n",
      "revolution--offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea\r\n",
      "of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as\r\n",
      "soon as possible to my room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer\r\n",
      "affair enough. There were hours, from day to day,--or at least there\r\n",
      "were moments, snatched even from clear duties,--when I had to shut\r\n",
      "myself up to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than\r\n",
      "I could bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for\r\n",
      "the truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth\r\n",
      "that I could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom\r\n",
      "I had been so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately\r\n",
      "concerned. It took little time to see that I could sound without forms\r\n",
      "of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complication. The\r\n",
      "shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at\r\n",
      "the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention, that\r\n",
      "I had not been practised upon by the servants nor made the object of\r\n",
      "any \"game.\" Of whatever it was that I knew nothing was known around\r\n",
      "me. There was but one sane inference: someone had taken a liberty\r\n",
      "rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and\r\n",
      "locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to\r\n",
      "an intrusion; some unscrupulous traveller, curious in old houses, had\r\n",
      "made his way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of\r\n",
      "view, and then stolen out as he came. If he had given me such a bold\r\n",
      "hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The good thing,\r\n",
      "after all, was that we should surely see no more of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge\r\n",
      "that what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my\r\n",
      "charming work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora,\r\n",
      "and through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could\r\n",
      "throw myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges\r\n",
      "was a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my\r\n",
      "original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the\r\n",
      "probable grey prose of my office. There was to be no grey prose,\r\n",
      "it appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming\r\n",
      "that presented itself as daily beauty? It was all the romance of the\r\n",
      "nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom. I don't mean by this, of\r\n",
      "course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express\r\n",
      "no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can\r\n",
      "I describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to\r\n",
      "them--and it's a marvel for a governess: I call the sisterhood to\r\n",
      "witness!--I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one direction,\r\n",
      "assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued\r\n",
      "to cover the region of the boy's conduct at school. It had been\r\n",
      "promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery without a\r\n",
      "pang. Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that--without\r\n",
      "a word--he himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge\r\n",
      "absurd. My conclusion bloomed there with the real rose-flush of his\r\n",
      "innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid, unclean\r\n",
      "school-world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely that\r\n",
      "the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always,\r\n",
      "on the part of the majority--which could include even stupid, sordid\r\n",
      "head-masters--turns infallibly to the vindictive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and\r\n",
      "it never made Miles a muff) that kept them--how shall I express\r\n",
      "it?--almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were like\r\n",
      "the cherubs of the anecdote, who had--morally, at any rate--nothing to\r\n",
      "whack! I remember feeling with Miles in especial as if he had had, as\r\n",
      "it were, no history. We expect of a small child a scant one, but there\r\n",
      "was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive,\r\n",
      "yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age\r\n",
      "I have seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. He had never for a\r\n",
      "second suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his having really\r\n",
      "been chastised. If he had been wicked he would have \"caught\" it,\r\n",
      "and I should have caught it by the rebound--I should have found the\r\n",
      "trace. I found nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never\r\n",
      "spoke of his school, never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for\r\n",
      "my part, was quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I\r\n",
      "was under the spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time,\r\n",
      "I perfectly knew I was. But I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote\r\n",
      "to any pain, and I had more pains than one. I was in receipt in these\r\n",
      "days of disturbing letters from home, where things were not going\r\n",
      "well. But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was\r\n",
      "the question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by\r\n",
      "their loveliness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a Sunday--to get on--when it rained with such force and\r\n",
      "for so many hours that there could be no procession to church;\r\n",
      "in consequence of which, as the day declined, I had arranged with\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose that, should the evening show improvement, we would attend\r\n",
      "together the late service. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared\r\n",
      "for our walk, which, through the park and by the good road to the\r\n",
      "village, would be a matter of twenty minutes. Coming downstairs to\r\n",
      "meet my colleague in the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had\r\n",
      "required three stitches and that had received them--with a publicity\r\n",
      "perhaps not edifying--while I sat with the children at their tea,\r\n",
      "served on Sundays, by exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany\r\n",
      "and brass, the \"grown-up\" dining-room. The gloves had been dropped\r\n",
      "there, and I turned in to recover them. The day was grey enough, but\r\n",
      "the afternoon light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing\r\n",
      "the threshold, not only to recognise, on a chair near the wide window,\r\n",
      "then closed, the articles I wanted, but to become aware of a person on\r\n",
      "the other side of the window and looking straight in. One step into the\r\n",
      "room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all there. The\r\n",
      "person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to\r\n",
      "me. He appeared thus again with I won't say greater distinctness,\r\n",
      "for that was impossible, but with a nearness that represented a forward\r\n",
      "stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met him, catch my breath\r\n",
      "and turn cold. He was the same--he was the same, and seen, this time,\r\n",
      "as he had been seen before, from the waist up, the window, though the\r\n",
      "dining-room was on the ground-floor, not going down to the terrace\r\n",
      "on which he stood. His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of\r\n",
      "this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the former\r\n",
      "had been. He remained but a few seconds--long enough to convince me\r\n",
      "he also saw and recognised; but it was as if I had been looking at him\r\n",
      "for years and had known him always. Something, however, happened this\r\n",
      "time that had not happened before; his stare into my face, through\r\n",
      "the glass and across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it\r\n",
      "quitted me for a moment during which I could still watch it, see it\r\n",
      "fix successively several other things. On the spot there came to me the\r\n",
      "added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He\r\n",
      "had come for someone else.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The flash of this knowledge--for it was knowledge in the midst of\r\n",
      "dread--produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started, as I\r\n",
      "stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage\r\n",
      "because I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight\r\n",
      "out of the door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant,\r\n",
      "upon the drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush,\r\n",
      "turned a corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing\r\n",
      "now--my visitor had vanished. I stopped, I almost dropped, with the\r\n",
      "real relief of this; but I took in the whole scene--I gave him time\r\n",
      "to reappear. I call it time, but how long was it? I can't speak\r\n",
      "to the purpose today of the duration of these things. That kind of\r\n",
      "measure must have left me: they couldn't have lasted as they actually\r\n",
      "appeared to me to last. The terrace and the whole place, the lawn and\r\n",
      "the garden beyond it, all I could see of the park, were empty with a\r\n",
      "great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big trees, but I remember\r\n",
      "the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed him. He was\r\n",
      "there or was not there: not there if I didn't see him. I got hold of\r\n",
      "this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went\r\n",
      "to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place\r\n",
      "myself where he had stood. I did so; I applied my face to the pane\r\n",
      "and looked, as he had looked, into the room. As if, at this moment, to\r\n",
      "show me exactly what his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for\r\n",
      "himself just before, came in from the hall. With this I had the full\r\n",
      "image of a repetition of what had already occurred. She saw me as I\r\n",
      "had seen my own visitant; she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her\r\n",
      "something of the shock that I had received. She turned white, and this\r\n",
      "made me ask myself if I had blanched as much. She stared, in short,\r\n",
      "and retreated on just _my_ lines, and I knew she had then passed out\r\n",
      "and come round to me and that I should presently meet her. I remained\r\n",
      "where I was, and while I waited I thought of more things than one. But\r\n",
      "there's only one I take space to mention. I wondered why _she_ should\r\n",
      "be scared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "V\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house,\r\n",
      "she loomed again into view. \"What in the name of goodness is the\r\n",
      "matter----?\" She was now flushed and out of breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I said nothing till she came quite near. \"With me?\" I must have\r\n",
      "made a wonderful face. \"Do I show it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're as white as a sheet. You look awful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. My\r\n",
      "need to respect the bloom of Mrs. Grose's had dropped, without a\r\n",
      "rustle, from my shoulders, and if I wavered for the instant it was not\r\n",
      "with what I kept back. I put out my hand to her and she took it; I held\r\n",
      "her hard a little, liking to feel her close to me. There was a kind\r\n",
      "of support in the shy heave of her surprise. \"You came for me for\r\n",
      "church, of course, but I can't go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has anything happened?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Through this window? Dreadful!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" I said, \"I've been frightened.\" Mrs. Grose's eyes\r\n",
      "expressed plainly that _she_ had no wish to be, yet also that she\r\n",
      "knew too well her place not to be ready to share with me any marked\r\n",
      "inconvenience. Oh, it was quite settled that she _must_ share! \"Just\r\n",
      "what you saw from the dining-room a minute ago was the effect of\r\n",
      "that. What _I_ saw--just before--was much worse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her hand tightened. \"What was it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An extraordinary man. Looking in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What extraordinary man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I haven't the least idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose gazed round us in vain. \"Then where is he gone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you seen him before?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--once. On the old tower.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose's round eyes encountered this charge. \"Ah, I haven't\r\n",
      "guessed!\" she said very simply. \"How can I if _you_ don't\r\n",

      "Mrs. Grose looked round again. \"What was he doing on the tower?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only standing there and looking down at me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She thought a minute. \"Was he a gentleman?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Nobody--nobody. I didn't tell you, but I made sure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It\r\n",
      "only went indeed a little way. \"But if he isn't a gentleman----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What _is_ he? He's a horror.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier\r\n",
      "distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt\r\n",
      "inconsequence. \"It's time we should be at church.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm not fit for church!\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I spoke boldly. \"I'm afraid of _him_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose's large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the\r\n",
      "far-away faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: I somehow made\r\n",
      "out in it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and\r\n",
      "that was as yet quite obscure to me. It comes back to me that I thought\r\n",
      "instantly of this as something I could get from her; and I felt it to\r\n",
      "be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. \"When\r\n",
      "was it--on the tower?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About the middle of the month. At this same hour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Almost at dark,\" said Mrs. Grose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then how did he get in?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And how did he get out?\" I laughed. \"I had no opportunity to ask\r\n",
      "him! This evening, you see,\" I pursued, \"he has not been able to\r\n",
      "get in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He only peeps?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hope it will be confined to that!\" She had now let go my hand;\r\n",
      "she turned away a little. I waited an instant; then I brought out:\r\n",
      "\"Go to church. Good-bye. I must watch.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Slowly she faced me again. \"Do you fear for them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We met in another long look. \"Don't _you_?\" Instead of answering\r\n",
      "she came nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to\r\n",
      "the glass. \"You see how he could see,\" I meanwhile went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She didn't move. \"How long was he here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Till I came out. I came to meet him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose at last turned round, and there was still more in her\r\n",
      "face. \"_I_ couldn't have come out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Neither could I!\" I laughed again. \"But I did come. I have my\r\n",
      "duty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So have I mine,\" she replied; after which she added: \"What is\r\n",
      "he like?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've been dying to tell you. But he's like nobody.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nobody?\" she echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has no hat.\" Then seeing in her face that she already, in\r\n",
      "this, with a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added\r\n",
      "stroke to stroke. \"He has red hair, very red, close-curling, and\r\n",
      "a pale face, long in shape, with straight, good features and little,\r\n",
      "rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are,\r\n",
      "somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might\r\n",
      "move a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange--awfully; but I only know\r\n",
      "clearly that they're rather small and very fixed. His mouth's wide,\r\n",
      "and his lips are thin, and except for his little whiskers he's quite\r\n",
      "clean-shaven. He gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An actor!\" It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose at that moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've never seen one, but so I suppose them. He's tall, active,\r\n",
      "erect,\" I continued, \"but never--no, never!--a gentleman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My companion's face had blanched as I went on; her round eyes started\r\n",
      "and her mild mouth gaped. \"A gentleman?\" she gasped, confounded,\r\n",
      "stupefied: \"a gentleman _he_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You know him then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She visibly tried to hold herself. \"But he _is_ handsome?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw the way to help her. \"Remarkably!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And dressed----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In somebody's clothes. They're smart, but they're not his\r\n",
      "own.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She broke into a breathless affirmative groan. \"They're the\r\n",
      "master's!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I caught it up. \"You _do_ know him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She faltered but a second. \"Quint!\" she cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quint?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Peter Quint--his own man, his valet, when he was here!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When the master was?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. \"He\r\n",
      "never wore his hat, but he did wear--well, there were waistcoats\r\n",
      "missed! They were both here--last year. Then the master went, and Quint\r\n",
      "was alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I followed, but halting a little. \"Alone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alone with _us_.\" Then, as from a deeper depth, \"In charge,\"\r\n",
      "she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what became of him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She hung fire so long that I was still more mystified. \"He went\r\n",
      "too,\" she brought out at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Went where?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her expression, at this, became extraordinary. \"God knows where! He\r\n",
      "died.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Died?\" I almost shrieked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to utter\r\n",
      "the wonder of it. \"Yes. Mr. Quint is dead.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It took of course more than that particular passage to place\r\n",
      "us together in presence of what we had now to live with as we\r\n",
      "could--my dreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly\r\n",
      "exemplified, and my companion's knowledge, henceforth,--a knowledge\r\n",
      "half consternation and half compassion,--of that liability. There had\r\n",
      "been, this evening, after the revelation that left me, for an hour,\r\n",
      "so prostrate--there had been, for either of us, no attendance on\r\n",
      "any service but a little service of tears and vows, of prayers and\r\n",
      "promises, a climax to the series of mutual challenges and pledges that\r\n",
      "had straightway ensued on our retreating together to the schoolroom and\r\n",
      "shutting ourselves up there to have everything out. The result of our\r\n",
      "having everything out was simply to reduce our situation to the last\r\n",
      "rigour of its elements. She herself had seen nothing, not the shadow\r\n",
      "of a shadow, and nobody in the house but the governess was in the\r\n",
      "governess's plight; yet she accepted without directly impugning my\r\n",
      "sanity the truth as I gave it to her, and ended by showing me, on this\r\n",
      "ground, an awe-stricken tenderness, an expression of the sense of my\r\n",
      "more than questionable privilege, of which the very breath has remained\r\n",
      "with me as that of the sweetest of human charities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we\r\n",
      "thought we might bear things together; and I was not even sure that,\r\n",
      "in spite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I\r\n",
      "knew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later what I was capable\r\n",
      "of meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly\r\n",
      "sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so\r\n",
      "compromising a contract. I was queer company enough--quite as queer as\r\n",
      "the company I received; but as I trace over what we went through I see\r\n",
      "how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good\r\n",
      "fortune, _could_ steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that\r\n",
      "led me straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I\r\n",
      "could take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could\r\n",
      "join me. Perfectly can I recall now the particular way strength came to\r\n",
      "me before we separated for the night. We had gone over and over every\r\n",
      "feature of what I had seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He was looking for someone else, you say--someone who was not\r\n",
      "you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He was looking for little Miles.\" A portentous clearness now\r\n",
      "possessed me. \"_That's_ whom he was looking for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in\r\n",
      "practically proving. I had an absolute certainty that I should see\r\n",

      "the household, of the half-dozen maids and men who were still of our\r\n",
      "small colony. But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the\r\n",
      "lucky fact that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation of scullions,\r\n",
      "had ever, within anyone's memory, attached to the kind old place. It\r\n",

      "together to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that Sunday night,\r\n",
      "I was, in the immediate later hours in especial--for it may be imagined\r\n",
      "whether I slept--still haunted with the shadow of something she had\r\n",
      "not told me. I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose had kept back. I was sure, moreover, by morning, that this\r\n",
      "was not from a failure of frankness, but because on every side there\r\n",
      "were fears. It seems to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the\r\n",
      "morrow's sun was high I had restlessly read into the facts before us\r\n",
      "almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and more\r\n",
      "cruel occurrences. What they gave me above all was just the sinister\r\n",
      "figure of the living man--the dead one would keep awhile!--and of\r\n",
      "the months he had continuously passed at Bly, which, added up, made\r\n",
      "a formidable stretch. The limit of this evil time had arrived only\r\n",
      "when, on the dawn of a winter's morning, Peter Quint was found, by a\r\n",
      "labourer going to early work, stone dead on the road from the village:\r\n",
      "a catastrophe explained--superficially at least--by a visible wound\r\n",
      "to his head; such a wound as might have been produced--and as, on the\r\n",
      "final evidence, _had_ been--by a fatal slip, in the dark and after\r\n",
      "leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path\r\n",
      "altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn\r\n",
      "mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much--practically, in\r\n",
      "the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything;\r\n",
      "but there had been matters in his life--strange passages and perils,\r\n",
      "secret disorders, vices more than suspected--that would have accounted\r\n",
      "for a good deal more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible\r\n",
      "picture of my state of mind; but I was in these days literally able to\r\n",
      "find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded\r\n",
      "of me. I now saw that I had been asked for a service admirable and\r\n",
      "difficult; and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen--oh,\r\n",
      "in the right quarter!--that I could succeed where many another girl\r\n",
      "might have failed. It was an immense help to me--I confess I rather\r\n",
      "applaud myself as I look back!--that I saw my service so strongly and\r\n",
      "so simply. I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in\r\n",
      "the world the most bereaved and the most loveable, the appeal of whose\r\n",
      "helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant\r\n",
      "ache of one's own committed heart. We were cut off, really, together;\r\n",
      "we were united in our danger. They had nothing but me, and I--well, I\r\n",
      "had _them_. It was in short a magnificent chance. This chance presented\r\n",
      "itself to me in an image richly material. I was a screen--I was to\r\n",
      "stand before them. The more I saw, the less they would. I began\r\n",
      "to watch them in a stifled suspense, a disguised excitement that\r\n",
      "might well, had it continued too long, have turned to something like\r\n",
      "madness. What saved me, as I now see, was that it turned to something\r\n",
      "else altogether. It didn't last as suspense--it was superseded by\r\n",
      "horrible proofs. Proofs, I say, yes--from the moment I really took\r\n",
      "hold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This moment dated from an afternoon hour that I happened to spend in\r\n",
      "the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left Miles\r\n",
      "indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window-seat; he had wished to\r\n",
      "finish a book, and I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable\r\n",
      "in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the\r\n",
      "restless. His sister, on the contrary, had been alert to come out,\r\n",
      "and I strolled with her half an hour, seeking the shade, for the sun\r\n",
      "was still high and the day exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with\r\n",
      "her, as we went, of how, like her brother, she contrived--it was the\r\n",
      "charming thing in both children--to let me alone without appearing to\r\n",
      "drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround. They were\r\n",
      "never importunate and yet never listless. My attention to them all\r\n",
      "really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this\r\n",
      "was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as\r\n",
      "an active admirer. I walked in a world of their invention--they had no\r\n",
      "occasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only\r\n",
      "with being, for them, some remarkable person or thing that the game\r\n",
      "of the moment required and that was merely, thanks to my superior, my\r\n",
      "exalted stamp, a happy and highly distinguished sinecure. I forget what\r\n",
      "I was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something\r\n",
      "very important and very quiet and that Flora was playing very hard. We\r\n",
      "were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography,\r\n",
      "the lake was the Sea of Azof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other\r\n",
      "side of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way this\r\n",
      "knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world--the\r\n",
      "strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly\r\n",
      "merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work--for I was something\r\n",
      "or other that could sit--on the old stone bench which overlooked the\r\n",
      "pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and\r\n",
      "yet without direct vision, the presence, at a distance, of a third\r\n",
      "person. The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant\r\n",
      "shade, but it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still\r\n",
      "hour. There was no ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least,\r\n",
      "in the conviction I from one moment to another found myself forming\r\n",
      "as to what I should see straight before me and across the lake as a\r\n",
      "consequence of raising my eyes. They were attached at this juncture\r\n",
      "to the stitching in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the\r\n",
      "spasm of my effort not to move them till I should so have steadied\r\n",
      "myself as to be able to make up my mind what to do. There was an\r\n",
      "alien object in view--a figure whose right of presence I instantly,\r\n",
      "passionately questioned. I recollect counting over perfectly the\r\n",
      "possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was more natural, for\r\n",
      "instance, than the appearance of one of the men about the place,\r\n",
      "or even of a messenger, a postman or a tradesman's boy, from the\r\n",
      "village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude\r\n",
      "as I was conscious--still even without looking--of its having upon the\r\n",
      "character and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than\r\n",
      "that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were\r\n",
      "not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself\r\n",
      "as soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the\r\n",
      "right second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough,\r\n",
      "I transferred my eyes straight to little Flora, who, at the moment,\r\n",
      "was about ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with\r\n",
      "the wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I\r\n",
      "held my breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden\r\n",
      "innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me. I waited,\r\n",
      "but nothing came; then, in the first place--and there is something\r\n",
      "more dire in this, I feel, than in anything I have to relate--I was\r\n",
      "determined by a sense that, within a minute, all sounds from her had\r\n",
      "previously dropped; and, in the second, by the circumstance that,\r\n",
      "also within the minute, she had, in her play, turned her back to the\r\n",
      "water. This was her attitude when I at last looked at her--looked with\r\n",
      "the confirmed conviction that we were still, together, under direct\r\n",
      "personal notice. She had picked up a small flat piece of wood, which\r\n",
      "happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to\r\n",
      "her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as\r\n",
      "a mast and make the thing a boat. This second morsel, as I watched\r\n",
      "her, she was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in\r\n",
      "its place. My apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that\r\n",
      "after some seconds I felt I was ready for more. Then I again shifted my\r\n",
      "eyes--I faced what I had to face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I got hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as I could; and I can\r\n",
      "give no intelligible account of how I fought out the interval. Yet I\r\n",
      "still hear myself cry as I fairly threw myself into her arms: \"They\r\n",
      "_know_--it's too monstrous: they know, they know!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what on earth----?\" I felt her incredulity as she held me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, all that _we_ know--and heaven knows what else besides!\"\r\n",
      "Then, as she released me, I made it out to her, made it out perhaps\r\n",
      "only now with full coherency even to myself. \"Two hours ago, in the\r\n",
      "garden\"--I could scarce articulate--\"Flora _saw_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the\r\n",
      "stomach. \"She has told you?\" she panted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not a word--that's the horror. She kept it to herself! The\r\n",
      "child of eight, _that_ child!\" Unutterable still, for me, was the\r\n",
      "stupefaction of it.\r\n",

      "companion's face. \"Another person--this time; but a figure of\r\n",

      "dreadful--with such an air also, and such a face!--on the other side\r\n",
      "of the lake. I was there with the child--quiet for the hour; and in the\r\n",

      "intention.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I made her turn pale. \"Intention?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To get hold of her.\" Mrs. Grose--her eyes just lingering on\r\n",
      "mine--gave a shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood\r\n",
      "there looking out I completed my statement. \"_That's_ what Flora\r\n",
      "knows.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "once more took my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if\r\n",
      "to fortify me against the increase of alarm I might draw from this\r\n",
      "disclosure. \"They were both infamous,\" she finally said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, for a little, we faced it once more together; and I found\r\n",
      "absolutely a degree of help in seeing it now so straight. \"I\r\n",
      "appreciate,\" I said, \"the great decency of your not having hitherto\r\n",
      "spoken; but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.\"\r\n",
      "She appeared to assent to this, but still only in silence; seeing which\r\n",

      "of her as distinctly as I had seen her by the pond; and I brought out\r\n",
      "with decision: \"It must have been also what _she_ wished!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose's face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Of her real reason for leaving? Oh, yes--as to that. She couldn't\r\n",

      "renewed touch of her kindness my power to resist broke down. I burst,\r\n",
      "as I had, the other time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to\r\n",

      "I had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution\r\n",
      "to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of\r\n",
      "a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. We\r\n",
      "were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else--difficult indeed\r\n",
      "as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience,\r\n",
      "was least to be questioned. Late that night, while the house slept,\r\n",
      "we had another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to\r\n",
      "its being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold\r\n",
      "her perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how,\r\n",
      "if I had \"made it up,\" I came to be able to give, of each of the\r\n",
      "persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail,\r\n",
      "their special marks--a portrait on the exhibition of which she had\r\n",
      "instantly recognised and named them. She wished, of course,--small\r\n",
      "blame to her!--to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her\r\n",
      "that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search\r\n",
      "for the way to escape from it. I encountered her on the ground of a\r\n",
      "probability that with recurrence--for recurrence we took for granted--I\r\n",
      "should get used to my danger, distinctly professing that my personal\r\n",
      "exposure had suddenly become the least of my discomforts. It was my new\r\n",
      "suspicion that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the\r\n",
      "later hours of the day had brought a little ease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my\r\n",
      "pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of\r\n",
      "their charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively\r\n",
      "cultivate and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other\r\n",
      "words, plunged afresh into Flora's special society and there become\r\n",
      "aware--it was almost a luxury!--that she could put her little conscious\r\n",
      "hand straight upon the spot that ached. She had looked at me in sweet\r\n",
      "speculation and then had accused me to my face of having \"cried.\"\r\n",
      "I had supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could\r\n",
      "literally--for the time, at all events--rejoice, under this fathomless\r\n",
      "charity, that they had not entirely disappeared. To gaze into the\r\n",
      "depths of blue of the child's eyes and pronounce their loveliness a\r\n",
      "trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference\r\n",
      "to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as\r\n",
      "might be, my agitation. I couldn't abjure for merely wanting to,\r\n",
      "but I could repeat to Mrs. Grose--as I did there, over and over, in\r\n",
      "the small hours--that with their voices in the air, their pressure\r\n",
      "on one's heart and their fragrant faces against one's cheek,\r\n",
      "everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty. It\r\n",
      "was a pity that, somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to\r\n",
      "re-enumerate the signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake,\r\n",
      "had made a miracle of my show of self-possession. It was a pity to be\r\n",
      "obliged to re-investigate the certitude of the moment itself and repeat\r\n",
      "how it had come to me as a revelation that the inconceivable communion\r\n",
      "I then surprised was a matter, for either party, of habit. It was a\r\n",
      "pity that I should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not\r\n",
      "having, in my delusion, so much as questioned that the little girl saw\r\n",
      "our visitant even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she\r\n",
      "wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to make me suppose she\r\n",
      "didn't, and at the same time, without showing anything, arrive at\r\n",
      "a guess as to whether I myself did! It was a pity that I needed once\r\n",
      "more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to\r\n",
      "divert my attention--the perceptible increase of movement, the greater\r\n",
      "intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of nonsense, and the\r\n",
      "invitation to romp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this\r\n",
      "review, I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort\r\n",
      "that still remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to\r\n",
      "asseverate to my friend that I was certain--which was so much to the\r\n",
      "good--that _I_ at least had not betrayed myself. I should not have\r\n",
      "been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind,--I scarce\r\n",
      "know what to call it,--to invoke such further aid to intelligence\r\n",
      "as might spring from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. She\r\n",
      "had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a great deal; but a small\r\n",
      "shifty spot on the wrong side of it all still sometimes brushed my\r\n",
      "brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how on this occasion--for\r\n",
      "the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our danger and our\r\n",
      "watch seemed to help--I felt the importance of giving the last jerk to\r\n",
      "the curtain. \"I don't believe anything so horrible,\" I recollect\r\n",
      "saying; \"no, let us put it definitely, my dear, that I don't. But\r\n",
      "if I did, you know, there's a thing I should require now, just\r\n",
      "without sparing you the least bit more--oh, not a scrap, come!--to get\r\n",
      "out of you. What was it you had in mind when, in our distress, before\r\n",
      "Miles came back, over the letter from his school, you said, under my\r\n",
      "insistence, that you didn't pretend for him that he had not literally\r\n",
      "_ever_ been 'bad'? He has _not_ literally 'ever,' in these\r\n",
      "weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely watched him;\r\n",
      "he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, loveable\r\n",
      "goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if\r\n",
      "you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to take. What was your\r\n",
      "exception, and to what passage in your personal observation of him did\r\n",
      "you refer?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and,\r\n",
      "at any rate, before the grey dawn admonished us to separate I had got\r\n",
      "my answer. What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to\r\n",
      "the purpose. It was neither more nor less than the circumstance that\r\n",
      "for a period of several months Quint and the boy had been perpetually\r\n",
      "together. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had\r\n",
      "ventured to criticise the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of\r\n",
      "so close an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank\r\n",
      "overture to Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner,\r\n",
      "requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,\r\n",
      "directly approached little Miles. What she had said to him, since I\r\n",
      "pressed, was that _she_ liked to see young gentlemen not forget their\r\n",
      "station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I pressed again, of course, at this. \"You reminded him that Quint was\r\n",
      "only a base menial?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As you might say! And it was his answer, for one thing, that was\r\n",
      "bad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And for another thing?\" I waited. \"He repeated your words to\r\n",
      "Quint?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, not that. It's just what he _wouldn't_!\" she could still\r\n",
      "impress upon me. \"I was sure, at any rate,\" she added, \"that he\r\n",
      "didn't. But he denied certain occasions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What occasions?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When they had been about together quite as if Quint were his\r\n",
      "tutor--and a very grand one--and Miss Jessel only for the little\r\n",
      "lady. When he had gone off with the fellow, I mean, and spent hours\r\n",
      "with him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He then prevaricated about it--he said he hadn't?\" Her assent\r\n",
      "was clear enough to cause me to add in a moment: \"I see. He lied.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it didn't\r\n",
      "matter; which indeed she backed up by a further remark. \"You see,\r\n",
      "after all, Miss Jessel didn't mind. She didn't forbid him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I considered. \"Did he put that to you as a justification?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this she dropped again. \"No, he never spoke of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mentioned her in connection with Quint?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out. \"Well, he didn't\r\n",
      "show anything. He denied,\" she repeated; \"he denied.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord, how I pressed her now! \"So that you could see he knew what was\r\n",
      "between the two wretches?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know--I don't know!\" the poor woman groaned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You do know, you dear thing,\" I replied; \"only you haven't\r\n",
      "my dreadful boldness of mind, and you keep back, out of timidity and\r\n",
      "modesty and delicacy, even the impression that, in the past, when you\r\n",
      "had, without my aid, to flounder about in silence, most of all made you\r\n",
      "miserable. But I shall get it out of you yet! There was something in\r\n",
      "the boy that suggested to you,\" I continued, \"that he covered and\r\n",
      "concealed their relation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, he couldn't prevent----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your learning the truth? I dare say! But, heavens,\" I fell, with\r\n",
      "vehemence, a-thinking, \"what it shows that they must, to that extent,\r\n",
      "have succeeded in making of him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, nothing that's not nice _now_!\" Mrs. Grose lugubriously\r\n",
      "pleaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't wonder you looked queer,\" I persisted, \"when I\r\n",
      "mentioned to you the letter from his school!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I doubt if I looked as queer as you!\" she retorted with homely\r\n",
      "force. \"And if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an\r\n",
      "angel now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed--and if he was a fiend at school! How, how,\r\n",
      "how? Well,\" I said in my torment, \"you must put it to me again,\r\n",
      "but I shall not be able to tell you for some days. Only, put it to me\r\n",
      "again!\" I cried in a way that made my friend stare. \"There are\r\n",
      "directions in which I must not for the present let myself go.\"\r\n",
      "Meanwhile I returned to her first example--the one to which she\r\n",
      "had just previously referred--of the boy's happy capacity for an\r\n",
      "occasional slip. \"If Quint--on your remonstrance at the time you\r\n",
      "speak of--was a base menial, one of the things Miles said to you, I\r\n",
      "find myself guessing, was that you were another.\" Again her admission\r\n",
      "was so adequate that I continued: \"And you forgave him that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wouldn't _you_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!\" And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound of the\r\n",
      "oddest amusement. Then I went on: \"At all events, while he was with\r\n",
      "the man----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them all!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It suited me too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it\r\n",
      "suited exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of\r\n",
      "forbidding myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the\r\n",
      "expression of this view that I will throw, just here, no further light\r\n",
      "on it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose. \"His having lied and been impudent are, I confess, less\r\n",
      "engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in\r\n",
      "him of the little natural man. Still,\" I mused, \"they must do, for\r\n",
      "they make me feel more than ever that I must watch.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It made me blush, the next minute, to see in my friend's face how\r\n",
      "much more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck\r\n",
      "me as presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing. This came\r\n",
      "out when, at the schoolroom door, she quitted me. \"Surely you don't\r\n",
      "accuse _him_----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember\r\n",
      "that, until further evidence, I now accuse nobody.\" Then, before\r\n",
      "shutting her out to go, by another passage, to her own place, \"I must\r\n",
      "just wait,\" I wound up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "IX\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I waited and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from\r\n",
      "my consternation. A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant\r\n",
      "sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to\r\n",
      "grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the\r\n",
      "sponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish\r\n",
      "grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined\r\n",
      "if I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it\r\n",
      "would yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to\r\n",
      "struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however,\r\n",
      "a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I\r\n",
      "used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought\r\n",
      "strange things about them; and the circumstance that these things only\r\n",
      "made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping\r\n",
      "them in the dark. I trembled lest they should see that they _were_ so\r\n",
      "immensely more interesting. Putting things at the worst, at all events,\r\n",
      "as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could\r\n",
      "only be--blameless and foredoomed as they were--a reason the more for\r\n",
      "taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse,\r\n",
      "I found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. As\r\n",
      "soon as I had done so I used to say to myself: \"What will they\r\n",
      "think of that? Doesn't it betray too much?\" It would have been\r\n",
      "easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray;\r\n",
      "but the real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still\r\n",
      "enjoy was that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement\r\n",
      "still effective even under the shadow of the possibility that it was\r\n",
      "studied. For if it occurred to me that I might occasionally excite\r\n",
      "suspicion by the little outbreaks of my sharper passion for them,\r\n",
      "so too I remember wondering if I mightn't see a queerness in the\r\n",
      "traceable increase of their own demonstrations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of\r\n",

      "which they were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite\r\n",
      "as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to\r\n",

      "many things for their poor protectress; I mean--though they got their\r\n",

      "most--in the way of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading\r\n",
      "her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out\r\n",
      "at her, in disguises, as animals and historical characters, and above\r\n",
      "all astonishing her by the \"pieces\" they had secretly got by heart\r\n",

      "a facility for everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh\r\n",
      "start, achieved remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if\r\n",
      "they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift,\r\n",
      "in the most unimposed little miracles of memory. They not only popped\r\n",
      "out at me as tigers and as Romans, but as Shakespeareans, astronomers,\r\n",
      "and navigators. This was so singularly the case that it had presumably\r\n",
      "much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day, I am at a\r\n",
      "loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on\r\n",
      "the subject of another school for Miles. What I remember is that I was\r\n",
      "content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment\r\n",
      "must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of\r\n",
      "cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson's\r\n",
      "daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not the brightest thread in\r\n",
      "the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the impression I might have\r\n",

      "never to be out of it--I could follow no scent very far. We lived in\r\n",
      "a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals. The\r\n",
      "musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest, but the\r\n",
      "elder in especial had a marvellous knack of catching and repeating. The\r\n",
      "schoolroom piano broke into all gruesome fancies; and when that\r\n",
      "failed there were confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of\r\n",
      "them going out in the highest spirits in order to \"come in\" as\r\n",
      "something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no revelation to\r\n",
      "me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys. What\r\n",
      "surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world\r\n",
      "who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine\r\n",
      "a consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that\r\n",
      "they never either quarrelled or complained is to make the note of\r\n",
      "praise coarse for their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed,\r\n",
      "when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of\r\n",
      "little understandings between them by which one of them should keep\r\n",
      "me occupied while the other slipped away. There is a _naif_ side, I\r\n",
      "suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupils practised upon me, it was\r\n",

      "on with the record of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge\r\n",
      "the most liberal faith--for which I little care; but--and this is\r\n",
      "another matter--I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way\r\n",
      "through it to the end. There came suddenly an hour after which, as\r\n",
      "I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering;\r\n",
      "but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest road\r\n",
      "out is doubtless to advance. One evening--with nothing to lead up\r\n",
      "or to prepare it--I felt the cold touch of the impression that had\r\n",
      "breathed on me the night of my arrival and which, much lighter then,\r\n",
      "as I have mentioned, I should probably have made little of in memory\r\n",
      "had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. I had not gone to bed;\r\n",
      "I sat reading by a couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books\r\n",
      "at Bly--last-century fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a\r\n",
      "distinctly deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray\r\n",
      "specimen, had reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed\r\n",
      "curiosity of my youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand was\r\n",
      "Fielding's _Amelia_; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further\r\n",
      "both a general conviction that it was horribly late and a particular\r\n",
      "objection to looking at my watch. I figure, finally, that the white\r\n",
      "curtain draping, in the fashion of those days, the head of Flora's\r\n",
      "little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long before, the\r\n",
      "perfection of childish rest. I recollect in short that, though I was\r\n",
      "deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn of a page\r\n",
      "and with his spell all scattered, looking straight up from him and hard\r\n",
      "at the door of my room. There was a moment during which I listened,\r\n",
      "reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of there being\r\n",
      "something undefineably astir in the house, and noted the soft breath of\r\n",
      "the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all the\r\n",
      "marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there\r\n",
      "been anyone to admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet, and,\r\n",
      "taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the passage,\r\n",
      "on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked\r\n",
      "the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I\r\n",
      "went straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came\r\n",
      "within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn\r\n",
      "of the staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware\r\n",
      "of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had\r\n",
      "flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out,\r\n",
      "and I perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of\r\n",
      "earliest morning rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant,\r\n",
      "I saw that there was someone on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I\r\n",
      "required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter\r\n",
      "with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing half-way up and\r\n",
      "was therefore on the spot nearest the window, where at sight of me,\r\n",
      "it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower\r\n",
      "and from the garden. He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the\r\n",
      "cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on\r\n",
      "the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common\r\n",
      "intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable,\r\n",
      "dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve\r\n",
      "this distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that\r\n",
      "dread had unmistakeably quitted me and that there was nothing in me\r\n",
      "there that didn't meet and measure him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had,\r\n",
      "thank God, no terror. And he knew I had not--I found myself at the end\r\n",
      "of an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigour\r\n",
      "of confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease--for\r\n",
      "the time, at least--to have him to reckon with; and during the minute,\r\n",
      "accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview:\r\n",
      "hideous just because it _was_ human, as human as to have met alone,\r\n",
      "in the small hours, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer,\r\n",
      "some criminal. It was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close\r\n",
      "quarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of\r\n",
      "the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at such\r\n",
      "an hour, we still at least would have spoken. Something would have\r\n",
      "passed, in life, between us; if nothing had passed one of us would have\r\n",
      "moved. The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little\r\n",
      "more to make me doubt if even _I_ were in life. I can't express what\r\n",
      "followed it save by saying that the silence itself--which was indeed in\r\n",
      "a manner an attestation of my strength--became the element into which I\r\n",
      "saw the figure disappear; in which I definitely saw it turn as I might\r\n",
      "have seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt\r\n",
      "of an order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no\r\n",
      "hunch could have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into\r\n",
      "the darkness in which the next bend was lost.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "X\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect\r\n",
      "presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had\r\n",
      "gone: then I returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there\r\n",
      "by the light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora's\r\n",
      "little bed was empty; and on this I caught my breath with all the\r\n",
      "terror that, five minutes before, I had been able to resist. I\r\n",
      "dashed at the place in which I had left her lying and over which\r\n",
      "(for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged)\r\n",
      "the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward; then my step,\r\n",
      "to my unutterable relief, produced an answering sound: I perceived an\r\n",
      "agitation of the window-blind, and the child, ducking down, emerged\r\n",
      "rosily from the other side of it. She stood there in so much of her\r\n",
      "candour and so little of her nightgown, with her pink bare feet and\r\n",
      "the golden glow of her curls. She looked intensely grave, and I had\r\n",
      "never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill\r\n",
      "of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that\r\n",
      "she addressed me with a reproach. \"You naughty: where _have_ you\r\n",
      "been?\"--instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself\r\n",
      "arraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with\r\n",
      "the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay\r\n",
      "there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had\r\n",
      "become of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back\r\n",
      "into my chair--feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she\r\n",
      "had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given\r\n",
      "herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful\r\n",
      "little face that was still flushed with sleep. I remember closing\r\n",
      "my eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of\r\n",
      "something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own. \"You were\r\n",
      "looking for me out of the window?\" I said. \"You thought I might be\r\n",
      "walking in the grounds?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you know, I thought someone was\"--she never blanched as she\r\n",
      "smiled out that at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, how I looked at her now! \"And did you see anyone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, _no_!\" she returned, almost with the full privilege of\r\n",
      "childish inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in\r\n",
      "her little drawl of the negative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she\r\n",
      "lied; and if I once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of\r\n",
      "the three or four possible ways in which I might take this up. One\r\n",
      "of these, for a moment, tempted me with such singular intensity that,\r\n",
      "to withstand it, I must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that,\r\n",
      "wonderfully, she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. Why\r\n",
      "not break out at her on the spot and have it all over?--give it to her\r\n",
      "straight in her lovely little lighted face? \"You see, you see, you\r\n",
      "_know_ that you do and that you already quite suspect I believe it;\r\n",
      "therefore why not frankly confess it to me, so that we may at least\r\n",
      "live with it together and learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our\r\n",
      "fate, where we are and what it means?\" This solicitation dropped,\r\n",
      "alas, as it came: if I could immediately have succumbed to it I might\r\n",
      "have spared myself----well you'll see what. Instead of succumbing I\r\n",
      "sprang again to my feet, looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle\r\n",
      "way. \"Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think\r\n",
      "you were still there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Flora luminously considered; after which, with her little divine smile:\r\n",
      "\"Because I don't like to frighten you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But if I had, by your idea, gone out----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she turned her eyes to the flame\r\n",
      "of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as\r\n",
      "impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. \"Oh, but you know,\"\r\n",
      "she quite adequately answered, \"that you might come back, you dear,\r\n",
      "and that you _have_!\" And after a little, when she had got into bed,\r\n",
      "I had, for a long time, by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, to\r\n",
      "prove that I recognised the pertinence of my return.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of my\r\n",
      "nights. I repeatedly sat up till I didn't know when; I selected\r\n",
      "moments when my room-mate unmistakeably slept, and, stealing out,\r\n",
      "took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as far as to\r\n",
      "where I had last met Quint. But I never met him there again; and I\r\n",
      "may as well say at once that I on no other occasion saw him in the\r\n",
      "house. I just missed, on the staircase, on the other hand, a different\r\n",
      "adventure. Looking down it from the top I once recognised the presence\r\n",
      "of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back presented to\r\n",
      "me, her body half bowed and her head, in an attitude of woe, in her\r\n",
      "hands. I had been there but an instant, however, when she vanished\r\n",
      "without looking round at me. I knew, none the less, exactly what\r\n",
      "dreadful face she had to show; and I wondered whether, if instead\r\n",
      "of being above I had been below, I should have had, for going up,\r\n",
      "the same nerve I had lately shown Quint. Well, there continued to\r\n",
      "be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night after my latest\r\n",
      "encounter with that gentleman--they were all numbered now--I had an\r\n",
      "alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular\r\n",
      "quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It\r\n",
      "was precisely the first night during this series that, weary with\r\n",
      "watching, I had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself\r\n",
      "down at my old hour. I slept immediately and, as I afterwards knew,\r\n",
      "till about one o'clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up,\r\n",
      "as completely roused as if a hand had shook me. I had left a light\r\n",
      "burning, but it was now out, and I felt an instant certainty that\r\n",
      "Flora had extinguished it. This brought me to my feet and straight, in\r\n",
      "the darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. A glance at the\r\n",
      "window enlightened me further, and the striking of a match completed\r\n",
      "the picture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child had again got up--this time blowing out the taper, and had\r\n",
      "again, for some purpose of observation or response, squeezed in behind\r\n",
      "the blind and was peering out into the night. That she now saw--as\r\n",
      "she had not, I had satisfied myself, the previous time--was proved to\r\n",
      "me by the fact that she was disturbed neither by my re-illumination\r\n",
      "nor by the haste I made to get into slippers and into a wrap. Hidden,\r\n",
      "protected, absorbed, she evidently rested on the sill--the casement\r\n",
      "opened forward--and gave herself up. There was a great still moon to\r\n",
      "help her, and this fact had counted in my quick decision. She was\r\n",
      "face to face with the apparition we had met at the lake, and could\r\n",
      "now communicate with it as she had not then been able to do. What I,\r\n",
      "on my side, had to care for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from\r\n",
      "the corridor, some other window in the same quarter. I got to the door\r\n",
      "without her hearing me; I got out of it, closed it and listened, from\r\n",
      "the other side, for some sound from her. While I stood in the passage\r\n",
      "I had my eyes on her brother's door, which was but ten steps off and\r\n",
      "which, indescribably, produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse\r\n",
      "that I lately spoke of as my temptation. What if I should go straight\r\n",
      "in and march to _his_ window?--what if, by risking to his boyish\r\n",
      "bewilderment a revelation of my motive, I should throw across the rest\r\n",
      "of the mystery the long halter of my boldness?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold\r\n",
      "and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what\r\n",
      "might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and he\r\n",
      "too were secretly at watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, at the\r\n",
      "end of which my impulse failed. He was quiet; he might be innocent; the\r\n",
      "risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds--a\r\n",
      "figure prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom Flora was engaged;\r\n",
      "but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. I hesitated\r\n",
      "afresh, but on other grounds and only a few seconds; then I had made\r\n",
      "my choice. There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question\r\n",
      "of choosing the right one. The right one suddenly presented itself\r\n",
      "to me as the lower one--though high above the gardens--in the solid\r\n",
      "corner of the house that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was\r\n",
      "a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the\r\n",
      "extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had not for\r\n",
      "years, though kept by Mrs. Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I\r\n",
      "had often admired it and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after\r\n",
      "just faltering at the first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across\r\n",
      "it and unbolt as quietly as I could one of the shutters. Achieving\r\n",
      "this transit, I uncovered the glass without a sound and, applying\r\n",
      "my face to the pane, was able, the darkness without being much less\r\n",
      "than within, to see that I commanded the right direction. Then I saw\r\n",
      "something more. The moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable\r\n",
      "and showed me on the lawn a person, diminished by distance, who stood\r\n",
      "there motionless and as if fascinated, looking up to where I had\r\n",
      "appeared--looking, that is, not so much straight at me as at something\r\n",
      "that was apparently above me. There was clearly another person above\r\n",
      "me--there was a person on the tower; but the presence on the lawn was\r\n",
      "not in the least what I had conceived and had confidently hurried to\r\n",
      "meet. The presence on the lawn--I felt sick as I made it out--was poor\r\n",
      "little Miles himself.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "XI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not till late next day that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; the rigour\r\n",
      "with which I kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to\r\n",
      "meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of\r\n",
      "not provoking--on the part of the servants quite as much as on that\r\n",
      "of the children--any suspicion of a secret flurry or of a discussion\r\n",
      "of mysteries. I drew a great security in this particular from her mere\r\n",
      "smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others\r\n",

      "couldn't have borne the business alone. But she was a magnificent\r\n",
      "monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could\r\n",
      "see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability,\r\n",
      "their happiness and cleverness, she had no direct communication with\r\n",
      "the sources of my trouble. If they had been at all visibly blighted or\r\n",
      "battered, she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard\r\n",
      "enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her,\r\n",
      "when she surveyed them, with her large white arms folded and the\r\n",
      "habit of serenity in all her look, thank the Lord's mercy that if\r\n",
      "they were ruined the pieces would still serve. Flights of fancy gave\r\n",
      "place, in her mind, to a steady fireside glow, and I had already begun\r\n",
      "to perceive how, with the development of the conviction that--as time\r\n",
      "went on without a public accident--our young things could, after all,\r\n",
      "look out for themselves, she addressed her greatest solicitude to the\r\n",
      "sad case presented by their instructress. That, for myself, was a sound\r\n",
      "simplification: I could engage that, to the world, my face should tell\r\n",
      "no tales, but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added\r\n",
      "strain to find myself anxious about hers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the hour I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the\r\n",
      "terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now\r\n",
      "agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance,\r\n",
      "but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro in\r\n",
      "one of their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison,\r\n",
      "below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a\r\n",
      "storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in\r\n",
      "touch. Mrs. Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught\r\n",
      "the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned\r\n",
      "to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry. I had made her\r\n",
      "a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my\r\n",
      "superiority--my accomplishments and my function--in her patience under\r\n",
      "my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix\r\n",
      "a witch's broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held\r\n",
      "out a large clean saucepan. This had become thoroughly her attitude by\r\n",
      "the time that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the\r\n",
      "point of what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a\r\n",
      "monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be,\r\n",
      "I had gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a\r\n",
      "concentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a\r\n",
      "signal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my\r\n",
      "small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy\r\n",
      "my sense of the real splendour of the little inspiration with which,\r\n",
      "after I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate\r\n",
      "challenge. As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he\r\n",
      "had come to me as straight as possible; on which I had taken his hand\r\n",
      "without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase\r\n",
      "where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him, along the lobby where I\r\n",
      "had listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a sound, on the way, had passed between us, and I had wondered--oh,\r\n",
      "_how_ I had wondered!--if he were groping about in his little mind for\r\n",
      "something plausible and not too grotesque. It would tax his invention,\r\n",
      "certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real embarrassment, a\r\n",
      "curious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the inscrutable! He\r\n",
      "couldn't play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce would he get\r\n",
      "out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this\r\n",
      "question, an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce _I_ should. I was\r\n",
      "confronted at last, as never yet, with all the risk attached even now\r\n",
      "to sounding my own horrid note. I remember in fact that as we pushed\r\n",
      "into his little chamber, where the bed had not been slept in at all\r\n",
      "and the window, uncovered to the moonlight, made the place so clear\r\n",
      "that there was no need of striking a match--I remember how I suddenly\r\n",
      "dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that\r\n",
      "he must know how he really, as they say, \"had\" me. He could do what\r\n",
      "he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I should\r\n",
      "continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those\r\n",
      "caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He\r\n",
      "\"had\" me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve\r\n",
      "me, who would consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest\r\n",
      "tremor of an overture, I were the first to introduce into our perfect\r\n",
      "intercourse an element so dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to\r\n",
      "convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to\r\n",
      "suggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in the dark, he fairly\r\n",
      "shook me with admiration. I was of course thoroughly kind and merciful;\r\n",
      "never, never yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such\r\n",
      "tenderness as those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held\r\n",
      "him there well under fire. I had no alternative but, in form at least,\r\n",
      "to put it to him.\r\n",

      "and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk. \"If\r\n",
      "I tell you why, will you understand?\" My heart, at this, leaped into\r\n",
      "my mouth. _Would_ he tell me why? I found no sound on my lips to press\r\n",
      "it, and I was aware of replying only with a vague, repeated, grimacing\r\n",
      "nod. He was gentleness itself, and while I wagged my head at him he\r\n",
      "stood there more than ever a little fairy prince. It was his brightness\r\n",
      "indeed that gave me a respite. Would it be so great if he were really\r\n",

      "it, he bent forward and kissed me. It was practically the end of\r\n",
      "everything. I met his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him for a\r\n",
      "minute in my arms, the most stupendous effort not to cry. He had given\r\n",
      "exactly the account of himself that permitted least of my going behind\r\n",
      "it, and it was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it\r\n",
      "that, as I presently glanced about the room, I could say--\r\n",

      "reinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made\r\n",
      "before we separated. \"It all lies in half-a-dozen words,\" I said to\r\n",
      "her, \"words that really settle the matter. 'Think, you know, what\r\n",
      "I _might_ do!' He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows\r\n",

      "dead restored. He's not reading to her,\" I declared; \"they're\r\n",
      "talking of _them_--they're talking horrors! I go on, I know, as if I\r\n",

      "made _you_ so; but it has only made me more lucid, made me get hold of\r\n",
      "still other things.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My lucidity must have seemed awful, but the charming creatures who were\r\n",
      "victims of it, passing and repassing in their interlocked sweetness,\r\n",
      "gave my colleague something to hold on by; and I felt how tight she\r\n",
      "held as, without stirring in the breath of my passion, she covered them\r\n",
      "still with her eyes. \"Of what other things have you got hold?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, of the very things that have delighted, fascinated, and yet,\r\n",
      "at bottom, as I now so strangely see, mystified and troubled me. Their\r\n",

      "in the bad time--for there had been a worse even than this!--must have\r\n",
      "occurred. There could have been no such justification for me as the\r\n",
      "plain assent of her experience to whatever depth of depravity I found\r\n",

      "the outside of windows, the further edge of pools; but there's a\r\n",
      "deep design, on either side, to shorten the distance and overcome\r\n",
      "the obstacle; and the success of the tempters is only a question of\r\n",

      "foot of the stair, I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the house,\r\n",
      "that one had better not have seen. There was many a corner round which\r\n",
      "I expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely\r\n",
      "sinister way, would have favoured the appearance of Miss Jessel. The\r\n",
      "summer had turned, the summer had gone; the autumn had dropped upon\r\n",
      "Bly and had blown out half our lights. The place, with its grey sky\r\n",
      "and withered garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves,\r\n",
      "was like a theatre after the performance--all strewn with crumpled\r\n",
      "playbills. There were exactly states of the air, conditions of sound\r\n",
      "and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of the _kind_ of ministering\r\n",
      "moment, that brought back to me, long enough to catch it, the feeling\r\n",
      "of the medium in which, that June evening out-of-doors, I had had my\r\n",
      "first sight of Quint, and in which, too, at those other instants, I\r\n",
      "had, after seeing him through the window, looked for him in vain in the\r\n",
      "circle of shrubbery. I recognised the signs, the portents--I recognised\r\n",
      "the moment, the spot. But they remained unaccompanied and empty, and I\r\n",
      "continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young woman whose\r\n",
      "sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined but\r\n",
      "deepened. I had said in my talk with Mrs. Grose on that horrid scene\r\n",
      "of Flora's by the lake--and had perplexed her by so saying--that it\r\n",
      "would from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than\r\n",
      "to keep it. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the\r\n",
      "truth that, whether the children really saw or not--since, that is,\r\n",
      "it was not yet definitely proved--I greatly preferred, as a safeguard,\r\n",
      "the fulness of my own exposure. I was ready to know the very worst\r\n",
      "that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of was that\r\n",
      "my eyes might be sealed just while theirs were most opened. Well, my\r\n",
      "eyes _were_ sealed, it appeared, at present--a consummation for which\r\n",
      "it seemed blasphemous not to thank God. There was, alas, a difficulty\r\n",
      "about that: I would have thanked him with all my soul had I not had in\r\n",
      "a proportionate measure this conviction of the secret of my pupils.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How can I retrace today the strange steps of my obsession? There were\r\n",
      "times of our being together when I would have been ready to swear that,\r\n",
      "literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of it closed,\r\n",
      "they had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was that,\r\n",
      "had I not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might\r\n",
      "prove greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have\r\n",
      "broken out. \"They're here, they're here, you little wretches,\"\r\n",
      "I would have cried, \"and you can't deny it now!\" The little\r\n",
      "wretches denied it with all the added volume of their sociability\r\n",
      "and their tenderness, in just the crystal depths of which--like the\r\n",
      "flash of a fish in a stream--the mockery of their advantage peeped\r\n",
      "up. The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on\r\n",
      "the night when, looking out to see either Quint or Miss Jessel under\r\n",
      "the stars, I had beheld the boy over whose rest I watched and who had\r\n",
      "immediately brought in with him--had straightway, there, turned it on\r\n",
      "me--the lovely upward look with which, from the battlements above me,\r\n",
      "the hideous apparition of Quint had played. If it was a question of a\r\n",
      "scare, my discovery on this occasion had scared me more than any other,\r\n",
      "and it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my\r\n",
      "actual inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments,\r\n",
      "I shut myself up audibly to rehearse--it was at once a fantastic relief\r\n",
      "and a renewed despair--the manner in which I might come to the point. I\r\n",
      "approached it from one side and the other while, in my room, I flung\r\n",
      "myself about, but I always broke down in the monstrous utterance of\r\n",
      "names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself that I should\r\n",
      "indeed help them to represent something infamous if, by pronouncing\r\n",
      "them, I should violate as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy\r\n",
      "as any schoolroom, probably, had ever known. When I said to myself:\r\n",
      "\"_They_ have the manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are,\r\n",
      "the baseness to speak!\" I felt myself crimson and I covered my face\r\n",
      "with my hands. After these secret scenes I chattered more than ever,\r\n",
      "going on volubly enough till one of our prodigious, palpable hushes\r\n",
      "occurred--I can call them nothing else--the strange, dizzy lift or\r\n",
      "swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life, that\r\n",
      "had nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we\r\n",
      "might be engaged in making and that I could hear through any deepened\r\n",
      "exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano. Then\r\n",
      "it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though they were not\r\n",
      "angels, they \"passed,\" as the French, say, causing me, while they\r\n",
      "stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger\r\n",
      "victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than they\r\n",
      "had thought good enough for myself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that,\r\n",
      "whatever I had seen, Miles and Flora saw _more_--things terrible and\r\n",
      "unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in\r\n",
      "the past. Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time,\r\n",
      "a chill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all\r\n",
      "three, with repetition, got into such splendid training that we went,\r\n",
      "each time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident,\r\n",
      "through the very same movements. It was striking of the children, at\r\n",
      "all events, to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance\r\n",
      "and never to fail--one or the other--of the precious question that\r\n",
      "had helped us through many a peril. \"When do you think he _will_\r\n",
      "come? Don't you think we _ought_ to write?\"--there was nothing\r\n",
      "like that inquiry, we found by experience, for carrying off an\r\n",
      "awkwardness. \"He\" of course was their uncle in Harley Street;\r\n",
      "and we lived in much profusion of theory that he might at any moment\r\n",
      "arrive to mingle in our circle. It was impossible to have given less\r\n",
      "encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but if we had not\r\n",
      "had the doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other\r\n",
      "of some of our finest exhibitions. He never wrote to them--that may\r\n",
      "have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of his trust of\r\n",
      "me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a woman\r\n",
      "is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred\r\n",
      "laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of the\r\n",
      "pledge given not to appeal to him when I let my charges understand that\r\n",
      "their own letters were but charming literary exercises. They were too\r\n",
      "beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them all to this\r\n",
      "hour. This was a rule indeed which only added to the satiric effect\r\n",
      "of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any moment be\r\n",
      "among us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more awkward\r\n",
      "than anything else that might be for me. There appears to me, moreover,\r\n",
      "as I look back, no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere\r\n",
      "fact that, in spite of my tension and of their triumph, I never lost\r\n",
      "patience with them. Adorable they must in truth have been, I now\r\n",
      "reflect, that I didn't in these days hate them! Would exasperation,\r\n",
      "however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed\r\n",
      "me? It little matters, for relief arrived. I call it relief, though it\r\n",
      "was only the relief that a snap brings to a strain or the burst of a\r\n",
      "thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. It was at least change, and it\r\n",

      "Walking to church a certain Sunday morning, I had little Miles at my\r\n",
      "side and his sister, in advance of us and at Mrs. Grose's, well in\r\n",
      "sight. It was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some\r\n",
      "time; the night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air,\r\n",
      "bright and sharp, made the church-bells almost gay. It was an odd\r\n",
      "accident of thought that I should have happened at such a moment to\r\n",
      "be particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my\r\n",
      "little charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual\r\n",
      "society? Something or other had brought nearer home to me that I had\r\n",
      "all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that, in the way our companions\r\n",
      "were marshalled before me, I might have appeared to provide against\r\n",
      "some danger of rebellion. I was like a gaoler with an eye to possible\r\n",
      "surprises and escapes. But all this belonged--I mean their magnificent\r\n",
      "little surrender--just to the special array of the facts that were most\r\n",
      "abysmal. Turned out for Sunday by his uncle's tailor, who had had\r\n",
      "a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his grand little\r\n",
      "air, Miles's whole title to independence, the rights of his sex and\r\n",
      "situation, were so stamped upon him that if he had suddenly struck\r\n",
      "for freedom I should have had nothing to say. I was by the strangest\r\n",
      "of chances wondering how I should meet him when the revolution\r\n",
      "unmistakeably occurred. I call it a revolution because I now see how,\r\n",
      "with the word he spoke, the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful\r\n",
      "drama and the catastrophe was precipitated. \"Look here, my dear, you\r\n",
      "know,\" he charmingly said, \"when in the world, please, am I going\r\n",
      "back to school?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough, particularly\r\n",
      "as uttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all\r\n",
      "interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off\r\n",
      "intonations as if he were tossing roses. There was something in them\r\n",
      "that always made one \"catch\" and I caught, at any rate, now so\r\n",
      "effectually that I stopped as short as if one of the trees of the\r\n",
      "park had fallen across the road. There was something new, on the spot,\r\n",
      "between us, and he was perfectly aware that I recognised it, though,\r\n",
      "to enable me to do so, he had no need to look a whit less candid and\r\n",
      "charming than usual. I could feel in him how he already, from my\r\n",
      "at first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage he had\r\n",
      "gained. I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time,\r\n",
      "after a minute, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive\r\n",
      "smile: \"You know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady\r\n",
      "_always_----!\" His \"my dear\" was constantly on his lips for me,\r\n",
      "and nothing could have expressed more the exact shade of the sentiment\r\n",
      "with which I desired to inspire my pupils than its fond familiarity. It\r\n",
      "was so respectfully easy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick my own phrases! I\r\n",
      "remember that, to gain time, I tried to laugh, and I seemed to see\r\n",
      "in the beautiful face with which he watched me how ugly and queer I\r\n",
      "looked. \"And always with the same lady?\" I returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He neither blenched nor winked. The whole thing was virtually out\r\n",
      "between us. \"Ah, of course, she's a jolly, 'perfect' lady; but,\r\n",

      "way to it and clustered about the door to see us go in. I quickened\r\n",
      "our step; I wanted to get there before the question between us opened\r\n",
      "up much further; I reflected hungrily that, for more than an hour, he\r\n",

      "dusk of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on\r\n",
      "which I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running a race\r\n",
      "with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt that\r\n",

      "had passed into the church, the other worshippers had followed, and we\r\n",

      "rest. \"Does my uncle think what _you_ think?\"\r\n",

      "of this had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat there on my\r\n",
      "tomb and read into what my little friend had said to me the fulness\r\n",
      "of its meaning; by the time I had grasped the whole of which I had\r\n",

      "behind. That his uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things\r\n",
      "was a solution that, strictly speaking, I ought now to have desired to\r\n",
      "bring on; but I could so little face the ugliness and the pain of it\r\n",
      "that I simply procrastinated and lived from hand to mouth. The boy, to\r\n",
      "my deep discomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to\r\n",
      "say to me: \"Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this\r\n",

      "consciousness and a plan.\r\n",

      "That was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I\r\n",
      "walked round the church, hesitating, hovering; I reflected that I had\r\n",
      "already, with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch\r\n",
      "up nothing, and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into\r\n",
      "the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into\r\n",
      "mine and make me sit there for an hour in close, silent contact with\r\n",
      "his commentary on our talk. For the first minute since his arrival I\r\n",

      "before, in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things,\r\n",

      "after the place and who, availing herself of rare relief from\r\n",
      "observation and of the schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper,\r\n",
      "had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her\r\n",
      "sweetheart. There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested\r\n",

      "but at the moment I took this in I had already become aware that,\r\n",
      "in spite of my entrance, her attitude strangely persisted. Then it\r\n",
      "was--with the very act of its announcing itself--that her identity\r\n",
      "flared up in a change of posture. She rose, not as if she had heard\r\n",
      "me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy of indifference and\r\n",
      "detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there as my vile\r\n",

      "instants lasted indeed I had the extraordinary chill of a feeling that\r\n",
      "it was I who was the intruder. It was as a wild protest against it\r\n",
      "that, actually addressing her--\"You terrible, miserable woman!\"--I\r\n",
      "heard myself break into a sound that, by the open door, rang through\r\n",
      "the long passage and the empty house. She looked at me as if she heard\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness. But he clearly\r\n",
      "gained time; he waited, he called for guidance. \"Haven't I?\" It\r\n",
      "wasn't for _me_ to help him--it was for the thing I had met!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this\r\n",
      "from him, set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet\r\n",
      "known; so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled\r\n",
      "and his little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him,\r\n",
      "a part of innocence and consistency. \"No, never--from the hour you\r\n",
      "came back. You've never mentioned to me one of your masters, one of\r\n",
      "your comrades, nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at\r\n",
      "school. Never, little Miles--no, never--have you given me an inkling of\r\n",
      "anything that _may_ have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how\r\n",
      "much I'm in the dark. Until you came out, that way, this morning,\r\n",
      "you had, since the first hour I saw you, scarce even made a reference\r\n",
      "to anything in your previous life. You seemed so perfectly to accept\r\n",
      "the present.\" It was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his\r\n",
      "secret precocity (or whatever I might call the poison of an influence\r\n",
      "that I dared but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath\r\n",
      "of his inward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person--imposed\r\n",
      "him almost as an intellectual equal. \"I thought you wanted to go on\r\n",
      "as you are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It struck me that at this he just faintly coloured. He gave, at any\r\n",
      "rate, like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his\r\n",

      "\"You can't, even if you do. You can't, you can't!\"--he lay\r\n",

      "He said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable\r\n",
      "gaiety; and doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the\r\n",
      "poignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reappearance\r\n",
      "at the end of three months with all this bravado and still more\r\n",
      "dishonour. It overwhelmed me now that I should never be able to bear\r\n",
      "that, and it made me let myself go. I threw myself upon him and in the\r\n",
      "tenderness of my pity I embraced him. \"Dear little Miles, dear little\r\n",
      "Miles----!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with\r\n",
      "indulgent good-humour. \"Well, old lady?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is there nothing--nothing at all that you want to tell me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up\r\n",
      "his hand to look at as one had seen sick children look. \"I've told\r\n",
      "you--I told you this morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, I was sorry for him! \"That you just want me not to worry you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked round at me now, as if in recognition of my understanding\r\n",
      "him; then ever so gently, \"To let me alone,\" he replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was even a singular little dignity in it, something that made\r\n",
      "me release him, yet, when I had slowly risen, linger beside him. God\r\n",
      "knows I never wished to harass him, but I felt that merely, at this,\r\n",
      "to turn my back on him was to abandon or, to put it more truly, to lose\r\n",
      "him. \"I've just begun a letter to your uncle,\" I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, then, finish it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I waited a minute. \"What happened before?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gazed up at me again. \"Before what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Before you came back. And before you went away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For some time he was silent, but he continued to meet my eyes. \"What\r\n",
      "happened?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It made me, the sound of the words, in which it seemed to me that\r\n",
      "I caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting\r\n",
      "consciousness--it made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize\r\n",
      "once more the chance of possessing him. \"Dear little Miles, dear\r\n",
      "little Miles, if you _knew_ how I want to help you! It's only that,\r\n",
      "it's nothing but that, and I'd rather die than give you a pain\r\n",
      "or do you a wrong--I'd rather die than hurt a hair of you. Dear\r\n",
      "little Miles\"--oh, I brought it out now even if I _should_ go too\r\n",
      "far--\"I just want you to help me to save you!\" But I knew in a\r\n",
      "moment after this that I had gone too far. The answer to my appeal was\r\n",
      "instantaneous, but it came in the form of an extraordinary blast and\r\n",
      "chill, a gust of frozen air and a shake of the room as great as if,\r\n",
      "in the wild wind, the casement had crashed in. The boy gave a loud,\r\n",
      "high shriek, which, lost in the rest of the shock of sound, might have\r\n",
      "seemed, indistinctly, though I was so close to him, a note either of\r\n",
      "jubilation or of terror. I jumped to my feet again and was conscious of\r\n",
      "darkness. So for a moment we remained, while I stared about me and saw\r\n",
      "that the drawn curtains were unstirred and the window tight. \"Why,\r\n",
      "the candle's out!\" I then cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was I who blew it, dear!\" said Miles.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The next day, after lessons, Mrs. Grose found a moment to say to me\r\n",
      "quietly: \"Have you written, Miss?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--I've written.\" But I didn't add--for the hour--that\r\n",
      "my letter, sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. There would\r\n",
      "be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the\r\n",
      "village. Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more\r\n",
      "brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both\r\n",
      "had at heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed\r\n",
      "the dizziest feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of _my_ feeble\r\n",
      "range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and\r\n",
      "historical jokes. It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular\r\n",
      "that he appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down. This\r\n",
      "child, to my memory, really lives in a setting of beauty and misery\r\n",
      "that no words can translate; there was a distinction all his own in\r\n",
      "every impulse he revealed; never was a small natural creature, to the\r\n",
      "uninitiated eye all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more\r\n",
      "extraordinary little gentleman. I had perpetually to guard against\r\n",
      "the wonder of contemplation into which my initiated view betrayed me;\r\n",
      "to check the irrelevant gaze and discouraged sigh in which I constantly\r\n",
      "both attacked and renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman\r\n",
      "could have done that deserved a penalty. Say that, by the dark prodigy\r\n",
      "I knew, the imagination of all evil _had_ been opened up to him:\r\n",
      "all the justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have\r\n",
      "flowered into an act.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after\r\n",
      "our early dinner on this dreadful day, he came round to me and asked if\r\n",
      "I shouldn't like him, for half an hour, to play to me. David playing\r\n",
      "to Saul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion. It was\r\n",
      "literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite\r\n",
      "tantamount to his saying outright: \"The true knights we love to read\r\n",
      "about never push an advantage too far. I know what you mean now: you\r\n",
      "mean that--to be let alone yourself and not followed up--you'll cease\r\n",
      "to worry and spy upon me, won't keep me so close to you, will let me\r\n",
      "go and come. Well, I 'come,' you see--but I don't go! There'll\r\n",
      "be plenty of time for that. I do really delight in your society,\r\n",
      "and I only want to show you that I contended for a principle.\" It\r\n",
      "may be imagined whether I resisted this appeal or failed to accompany\r\n",
      "him again, hand in hand, to the schoolroom. He sat down at the old\r\n",
      "piano and played as he had never played, and if there are those who\r\n",
      "think he had better have been kicking a football I can only say that\r\n",
      "I wholly agree with them. For at the end of a time that under his\r\n",
      "influence I had quite ceased to measure I started up with a strange\r\n",
      "sense of having literally slept at my post. It was after luncheon,\r\n",
      "and by the schoolroom fire, and yet I hadn't really, in the least,\r\n",
      "slept: I had only done something much worse--I had forgotten. Where,\r\n",
      "all this time, was Flora? When I put the question to Miles he played on\r\n",
      "a minute before answering, and then could only say: \"Why, my dear,\r\n",
      "how do _I_ know?\"--breaking moreover into a happy laugh which,\r\n",
      "immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he prolonged\r\n",
      "into incoherent, extravagant song.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before\r\n",
      "going downstairs, I looked into several others. As she was nowhere\r\n",
      "about she would surely be with Mrs. Grose, whom, in the comfort of\r\n",
      "that theory, I accordingly proceeded in quest of. I found her where I\r\n",
      "had found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with\r\n",
      "blank, scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast,\r\n",
      "I had carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her\r\n",
      "right, for it was the very first time I had allowed the little girl\r\n",
      "out of my sight without some special provision. Of course now indeed\r\n",
      "she might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing was to look\r\n",
      "for her without an air of alarm. This we promptly arranged between us;\r\n",
      "but when, ten minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met\r\n",
      "in the hall, it was only to report on either side that after guarded\r\n",
      "inquiries we had altogether failed to trace her. For a minute there,\r\n",
      "apart from observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and I could feel with\r\n",
      "what high interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first\r\n",
      "given her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll be above,\" she presently said--\"in one of the rooms you\r\n",
      "haven't searched.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; she's at a distance.\" I had made up my mind. \"She has gone\r\n",
      "out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose stared. \"Without a hat?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I naturally also looked volumes. \"Isn't that woman always without\r\n",
      "one?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's with _her_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's with _her_!\" I declared. \"We must find them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My hand was on my friend's arm, but she failed for the moment,\r\n",
      "confronted with such an account of the matter, to respond to my\r\n",
      "pressure. She communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her\r\n",
      "uneasiness. \"And where's Master Miles?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, _he's_ with Quint. They're in the schoolroom.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord, Miss!\" My view, I was myself aware--and therefore I suppose\r\n",
      "my tone--had never yet reached so calm an assurance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The trick's played,\" I went on; \"they've successfully worked\r\n",
      "their plan. He found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while\r\n",
      "she went off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Divine'?\" Mrs. Grose bewilderedly echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Infernal, then!\" I almost cheerfully rejoined. \"He has provided\r\n",
      "for himself as well. But come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions. \"You leave\r\n",
      "him----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So long with Quint? Yes--I don't mind that now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She always ended, at these moments, by getting possession of my hand,\r\n",
      "and in this manner she could at present still stay me. But after\r\n",
      "gasping an instant at my sudden resignation, \"Because of your\r\n",
      "letter?\" she eagerly brought out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I quickly, by way of answer, felt for my letter, drew it forth,\r\n",
      "held it up, and then, freeing myself, went and laid it on the great\r\n",
      "hall-table. \"Luke will take it,\" I said as I came back. I reached\r\n",
      "the house-door and opened it; I was already on the steps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My companion still demurred: the storm of the night and the early\r\n",
      "morning had dropped, but the afternoon was damp and grey. I came down\r\n",
      "to the drive while she stood in the doorway. \"You go with nothing\r\n",
      "on?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do I care when the child has nothing? I can't wait to\r\n",
      "dress,\" I cried, \"and if you must do so, I leave you. Try\r\n",
      "meanwhile, yourself, upstairs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With _them_?\" Oh, on this, the poor woman promptly joined me!\r\n",

      "XIX\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I dare say\r\n",
      "rightly called, though I reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet\r\n",
      "of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untravelled eyes. My\r\n",
      "acquaintance with sheets of water was small, and the pool of Bly, at\r\n",
      "all events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the protection\r\n",
      "of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat\r\n",
      "moored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and\r\n",
      "its agitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from\r\n",
      "the house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora\r\n",
      "might be, she was not near home. She had not given me the slip for\r\n",
      "any small adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that I\r\n",
      "had shared with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of\r\n",
      "the quarter to which she most inclined. This was why I had now given\r\n",
      "to Mrs. Grose's steps so marked a direction--a direction that made\r\n",
      "her, when she perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was\r\n",
      "freshly mystified. \"You're going to the water, Miss?--you think\r\n",
      "she's _in_----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She may be, though the depth is, I believe, nowhere very great. But\r\n",
      "what I judge most likely is that she's on the spot from which, the\r\n",
      "other day, we saw together what I told you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When she pretended not to see----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With that astounding self-possession! I've always been sure she\r\n",
      "wanted to go back alone. And now her brother has managed it for her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose still stood where she had stopped. \"You suppose they\r\n",
      "really _talk_ of them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could meet this with a confidence! \"They say things that, if we\r\n",
      "heard them, would simply appal us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And if she _is_ there----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then Miss Jessel is?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Beyond a doubt. You shall see.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you!\" my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it\r\n",
      "in, I went straight on without her. By the time I reached the pool,\r\n",
      "however, she was close behind me, and I knew that, whatever, to her\r\n",
      "apprehension, might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her\r\n",
      "as her least danger. She exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came\r\n",
      "in sight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the\r\n",
      "child. There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank\r\n",
      "where my observation of her had been most startling, and none on the\r\n",
      "opposite edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick\r\n",
      "copse came down to the water. The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so\r\n",
      "scant compared to its length that, with its ends out of view, it might\r\n",
      "have been taken for a scant river. We looked at the empty expanse, and\r\n",
      "then I felt the suggestion of my friend's eyes. I knew what she meant\r\n",
      "and I replied with a negative headshake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no; wait! She has taken the boat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My companion stared at the vacant mooring-place and then again across\r\n",
      "the lake. \"Then where is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. She has used it to go\r\n",
      "over, and then has managed to hide it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All alone--that child?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's not alone, and at such times she's not a child: she's\r\n",
      "an old, old woman.\" I scanned all the visible shore while Mrs. Grose\r\n",
      "took again, into the queer element I offered her, one of her plunges\r\n",
      "of submission; then I pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a\r\n",
      "small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation\r\n",
      "masked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump\r\n",
      "of trees growing close to the water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But if the boat's there, where on earth's _she_?\" my colleague\r\n",
      "anxiously asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's exactly what we must learn.\" And I started to walk\r\n",
      "further.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By going all the way round?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, far as it is. It will take us but ten minutes, but it's\r\n",
      "far enough to have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight\r\n",
      "over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Laws!\" cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too\r\n",
      "much for her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had\r\n",
      "got half-way round--a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken\r\n",
      "and by a path choked with overgrowth--I paused to give her breath. I\r\n",
      "sustained her with a grateful arm, assuring her that she might hugely\r\n",
      "help me; and this started us afresh, so that in the course of but\r\n",
      "few minutes more we reached a point from which we found the boat to\r\n",
      "be where I had supposed it. It had been intentionally left as much as\r\n",
      "possible out of sight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that\r\n",
      "came, just there, down to the brink and that had been an assistance\r\n",
      "to disembarking. I recognised, as I looked at the pair of short, thick\r\n",
      "oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the feat for\r\n",
      "a little girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among wonders\r\n",
      "and had panted to too many livelier measures. There was a gate in the\r\n",
      "fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling\r\n",
      "interval, more into the open. Then, \"There she is!\" we both\r\n",
      "exclaimed at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Flora, a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smiled as\r\n",
      "if her performance was now complete. The next thing she did, however,\r\n",
      "was to stoop straight down and pluck--quite as if it were all she was\r\n",
      "there for--a big, ugly spray of withered fern. I instantly became sure\r\n",
      "she had just come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself\r\n",
      "taking a step, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which\r\n",
      "we presently approached her. She smiled and smiled, and we met; but it\r\n",
      "was all done in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. Mrs. Grose\r\n",
      "was the first to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and,\r\n",
      "drawing the child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little\r\n",
      "tender, yielding body. While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only\r\n",
      "watch it--which I did the more intently when I saw Flora's face peep\r\n",
      "at me over our companion's shoulder. It was serious now--the flicker\r\n",
      "had left it; but it strengthened the pang with which I at that moment\r\n",
      "envied Mrs. Grose the simplicity of _her_ relation. Still, all this\r\n",
      "while, nothing more passed between us save that Flora had let her\r\n",
      "foolish fern again drop to the ground. What she and I had virtually\r\n",
      "said to each other was that pretexts were useless now. When Mrs. Grose\r\n",
      "finally got up she kept the child's hand, so that the two were still\r\n",
      "before me; and the singular reticence of our communion was even more\r\n",
      "marked in the frank look she launched me. \"I'll be hanged,\" it\r\n",
      "said, \"if _I'll_ speak!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Flora who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the\r\n",
      "first. She was struck with our bareheaded aspect. \"Why, where are\r\n",
      "your things?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where yours are, my dear!\" I promptly returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an\r\n",
      "answer quite sufficient. \"And where's Miles?\" she went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was something in the small valour of it that quite finished me:\r\n",
      "these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a\r\n",
      "drawn blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks,\r\n",
      "had held high and full to the brim and that now, even before speaking,\r\n",
      "I felt overflow in a deluge. \"I'll tell you if you'll tell\r\n",
      "_me_----\" I heard myself say, then heard the tremor in which it\r\n",
      "broke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose's suspense blazed at me, but it was too late now, and I\r\n",
      "brought the thing out handsomely. \"Where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XX\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just as in the churchyard with Miles, the whole thing was upon us. Much\r\n",
      "as I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between\r\n",
      "us, been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child's\r\n",
      "face now received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the\r\n",
      "smash of a pane of glass. It added to the interposing cry, as if to\r\n",
      "stay the blow, that Mrs. Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my\r\n",
      "violence--the shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in\r\n",
      "turn, within a few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. I seized\r\n",
      "my colleague's arm. \"She's there, she's there!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had\r\n",
      "stood the other time, and I remember, strangely, as the first feeling\r\n",
      "now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. She\r\n",
      "was there, and I was justified; she was there, and I was neither\r\n",
      "cruel nor mad. She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was\r\n",
      "there most for Flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps\r\n",
      "so extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out to her--with\r\n",
      "the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and\r\n",
      "understand it--an inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect\r\n",
      "on the spot my friend and I had lately quitted, and there was not,\r\n",
      "in all the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell\r\n",
      "short. This first vividness of vision and emotion were things of a\r\n",
      "few seconds, during which Mrs. Grose's dazed blink across to where I\r\n",
      "pointed struck me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just\r\n",
      "as it carried my own eyes precipitately to the child. The revelation\r\n",
      "then of the manner in which Flora was affected startled me, in truth,\r\n",
      "far more than it would have done to find her also merely agitated,\r\n",
      "for direct dismay was of course not what I had expected. Prepared and\r\n",
      "on her guard as our pursuit had actually made her, she would repress\r\n",
      "every betrayal; and I was therefore shaken, on the spot, by my first\r\n",
      "glimpse of the particular one for which I had not allowed. To see her,\r\n",
      "without a convulsion of her small pink face, not even feign to glance\r\n",
      "in the direction of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of\r\n",
      "that, turn at _me_ an expression of hard, still gravity, an expression\r\n",
      "absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse\r\n",
      "and judge me--this was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl\r\n",
      "herself into the very presence that could make me quail. I quailed\r\n",
      "even though my certitude that she thoroughly saw was never greater\r\n",
      "than at that instant, and in the immediate need to defend myself\r\n",
      "I called it passionately to witness. \"She's there, you little\r\n",
      "unhappy thing--there, there, _there_, and you see her as well as you\r\n",
      "see me!\" I had said shortly before to Mrs. Grose that she was not at\r\n",
      "these times a child, but an old, old woman, and that description of her\r\n",
      "could not have been more strikingly confirmed than in the way in which,\r\n",
      "for all answer to this, she simply showed me, without a concession, an\r\n",
      "admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed\r\n",
      "suddenly quite fixed, reprobation. I was by this time--if I can put\r\n",
      "the whole thing at all together--more appalled at what I may properly\r\n",
      "call her manner than at anything else, though it was simultaneously\r\n",
      "with this that I became aware of having Mrs. Grose also, and very\r\n",
      "formidably, to reckon with. My elder companion, the next moment, at\r\n",
      "any rate, blotted out everything but her own flushed face and her loud,\r\n",
      "shocked protest, a burst of high disapproval. \"What a dreadful turn,\r\n",
      "to be sure, Miss! Where on earth do you see anything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could only grasp her more quickly yet, for even while she spoke the\r\n",
      "hideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted. It had already\r\n",
      "lasted a minute, and it lasted while I continued, seizing my colleague,\r\n",
      "quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my\r\n",
      "pointing hand. \"You don't see her exactly as _we_ see?--you mean\r\n",
      "to say you don't now--_now_? She's as big as a blazing fire! Only\r\n",
      "look, dearest woman, _look_----!\" She looked, even as I did, and\r\n",
      "gave me, with her deep groan of negation, repulsion, compassion--the\r\n",
      "mixture with her pity of her relief at her exemption--a sense, touching\r\n",
      "to me even then, that she would have backed me up if she could. I might\r\n",
      "well have needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof that her\r\n",
      "eyes were hopelessly sealed I felt my own situation horribly crumble,\r\n",
      "I felt--I saw--my livid predecessor press, from her position, on my\r\n",
      "defeat, and I was conscious, more than all, of what I should have\r\n",
      "from this instant to deal with in the astounding little attitude\r\n",
      "of Flora. Into this attitude Mrs. Grose immediately and violently\r\n",
      "entered, breaking, even while there pierced through my sense of ruin a\r\n",
      "prodigious private triumph, into breathless reassurance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She isn't there, little lady, and nobody's there--and you\r\n",
      "never see nothing, my sweet! How can poor Miss Jessel--when poor Miss\r\n",
      "Jessel's dead and buried? _We_ know, don't we, love?\"--and she\r\n",
      "appealed, blundering in, to the child. \"It's all a mere mistake and\r\n",
      "a worry and a joke--and we'll go home as fast as we can!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness\r\n",
      "of propriety, and they were again, with Mrs. Grose on her feet, united,\r\n",
      "as it were, in pained opposition to me. Flora continued to fix me with\r\n",
      "her small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute I prayed God to\r\n",
      "forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight\r\n",
      "to our friend's dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly\r\n",
      "failed, had quite vanished. I've said it already--she was literally,\r\n",
      "she was hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly. \"I\r\n",
      "don't know what you mean. I see nobody. I see nothing. I never\r\n",
      "_have_. I think you're cruel. I don't like you!\" Then, after\r\n",
      "this deliverance, which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little\r\n",
      "girl in the street, she hugged Mrs. Grose more closely and buried in\r\n",
      "her skirts the dreadful little face. In this position she produced an\r\n",
      "almost furious wail. \"Take me away, take me away--oh, take me away\r\n",
      "from _her_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From _me_?\" I panted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From you--from you!\" she cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even Mrs. Grose looked across at me dismayed, while I had nothing\r\n",
      "to do but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite\r\n",
      "bank, without a movement, as rigidly still as if catching, beyond the\r\n",
      "interval, our voices, was as vividly there for my disaster as it was\r\n",
      "not there for my service. The wretched child had spoken exactly as if\r\n",
      "she had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words,\r\n",
      "and I could therefore, in the full despair of all I had to accept,\r\n",
      "but sadly shake my head at her. \"If I had ever doubted, all my doubt\r\n",
      "would at present have gone. I've been living with the miserable\r\n",
      "truth, and now it has only too much closed round me. Of course\r\n",
      "I've lost you: I've interfered, and you've seen--under _her_\r\n",
      "dictation\"--with which I faced, over the pool again, our infernal\r\n",
      "witness--\"the easy and perfect way to meet it. I've done my best,\r\n",
      "but I've lost you. Good-bye.\" For Mrs. Grose I had an imperative,\r\n",
      "an almost frantic \"Go, go!\" before which, in infinite distress,\r\n",
      "but mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly convinced, in spite\r\n",
      "of her blindness, that something awful had occurred and some collapse\r\n",
      "engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had come, as fast as she\r\n",
      "could move.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of what first happened when I was left alone I had no subsequent\r\n",
      "memory. I only knew that at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an\r\n",
      "hour, an odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and piercing my\r\n",
      "trouble, had made me understand that I must have thrown myself, on\r\n",
      "my face, on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief. I must\r\n",
      "have lain there long and cried and sobbed, for when I raised my head\r\n",
      "the day was almost done. I got up and looked a moment, through the\r\n",
      "twilight, at the grey pool and its blank, haunted edge, and then\r\n",
      "I took, back to the house, my dreary and difficult course. When I\r\n",
      "reached the gate in the fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone,\r\n",
      "so that I had a fresh reflection to make on Flora's extraordinary\r\n",
      "command of the situation. She passed that night, by the most tacit,\r\n",
      "and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a false note, the\r\n",
      "happiest of arrangements, with Mrs. Grose. I saw neither of them on\r\n",
      "my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation,\r\n",
      "I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw--I can use no other phrase--so much\r\n",
      "of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever been. No evening\r\n",
      "I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of this one; in spite\r\n",
      "of which--and in spite also of the deeper depths of consternation that\r\n",
      "had opened beneath my feet--there was literally, in the ebbing actual,\r\n",
      "an extraordinarily sweet sadness. On reaching the house I had never so\r\n",
      "much as looked for the boy; I had simply gone straight to my room to\r\n",
      "change what I was wearing and to take in, at a glance, much material\r\n",
      "testimony to Flora's rupture. Her little belongings had all been\r\n",
      "removed. When later, by the schoolroom fire, I was served with tea\r\n",
      "by the usual maid, I indulged, on the article of my other pupil,\r\n",
      "in no inquiry whatever. He had his freedom now--he might have it to\r\n",
      "the end! Well, he did have it; and it consisted--in part at least--of\r\n",
      "his coming in at about eight o'clock and sitting down with me in\r\n",
      "silence. On the removal of the tea-things I had blown out the candles\r\n",
      "and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious of a mortal coldness and\r\n",
      "felt as if I should never again be warm. So, when he appeared, I was\r\n",
      "sitting in the glow with my thoughts. He paused a moment by the door as\r\n",
      "if to look at me; then--as if to share them--came to the other side of\r\n",
      "the hearth and sank into a chair. We sat there in absolute stillness;\r\n",
      "yet he wanted, I felt, to be with me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XXI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes opened to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. Flora was so\r\n",
      "markedly feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed\r\n",
      "a night of extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had\r\n",
      "for their subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present,\r\n",
      "governess. It was not against the possible re-entrance of Miss Jessel\r\n",
      "on the scene that she protested--it was conspicuously and passionately\r\n",
      "against mine. I was promptly on my feet of course, and with an immense\r\n",
      "deal to ask; the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her\r\n",
      "loins to meet me once more. This I felt as soon as I had put to her\r\n",
      "the question of her sense of the child's sincerity as against my\r\n",
      "own. \"She persists in denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen,\r\n",
      "anything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My visitor's trouble, truly, was great. \"Ah, Miss, it isn't a\r\n",
      "matter on which I can push her! Yet it isn't either, I must say, as\r\n",
      "if I much needed to. It has made her, every inch of her, quite old.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I see her perfectly from here. She resents, for all the world\r\n",
      "like some high little personage, the imputation on her truthfulness\r\n",
      "and, as it were, her respectability. 'Miss Jessel indeed--_she_!'\r\n",
      "Ah, she's 'respectable,' the chit! The impression she gave me\r\n",
      "there yesterday was, I assure you, the very strangest of all; it was\r\n",
      "quite beyond any of the others. I _did_ put my foot in it! She'll\r\n",
      "never speak to me again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hideous and obscure as it all was, it held Mrs. Grose briefly silent;\r\n",
      "then she granted my point with a frankness which, I made sure, had more\r\n",
      "behind it. \"I think indeed, Miss, she never will. She do have a grand\r\n",
      "manner about it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And that manner\"--I summed it up--\"is practically what's the\r\n",
      "matter with her now!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, that manner, I could see in my visitor's face, and not a little\r\n",
      "else besides! \"She asks me every three minutes if I think you're\r\n",
      "coming in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see--I see.\" I too, on my side, had so much more than worked it\r\n",
      "out. \"Has she said to you since yesterday--except to repudiate her\r\n",
      "familiarity with anything so dreadful--a single other word about Miss\r\n",
      "Jessel?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not one, Miss. And of course you know,\" my friend added, \"I took\r\n",
      "it from her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there\r\n",
      "_was_ nobody.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rather! And, naturally, you take it from her still.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing in the world! You've the cleverest little person to deal\r\n",
      "with. They've made them--their two friends, I mean--still cleverer\r\n",
      "even than nature did; for it was wondrous material to play on! Flora\r\n",
      "has now her grievance, and she'll work it to the end.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, Miss; but to _what_ end?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, that of dealing with me to her uncle. She'll make me out to\r\n",
      "him the lowest creature----!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I winced at the fair show of the scene in Mrs. Grose's face; she\r\n",
      "looked for a minute as if she sharply saw them together. \"And him who\r\n",
      "thinks so well of you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has an odd way--it comes over me now,\" I laughed, \"--of\r\n",
      "proving it! But that doesn't matter. What Flora wants, of course, is\r\n",
      "to get rid of me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My companion bravely concurred. \"Never again to so much as look at\r\n",
      "you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So that what you've come to me now for,\" I asked, \"is to speed\r\n",
      "me on my way?\" Before she had time to reply, however, I had her in\r\n",
      "check. \"I've a better idea--the result of my reflections. My going\r\n",
      "_would_ seem the right thing, and on Sunday I was terribly near it. Yet\r\n",
      "that won't do. It's _you_ who must go. You must take Flora.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My visitor, at this, did speculate. \"But where in the world----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Away from here. Away from _them_. Away, even most of all, now, from\r\n",
      "me. Straight to her uncle.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only to tell on you----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, not 'only'! To leave me, in addition, with my remedy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was still vague. \"And what _is_ your remedy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your loyalty, to begin with. And then Miles's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked at me hard. \"Do you think he----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Won't if he has the chance, turn on me? Yes, I venture still\r\n",
      "to think it. At all events, I want to try. Get off with his sister\r\n",
      "as soon as possible and leave me with him alone.\" I was amazed,\r\n",
      "myself, at the spirit I had still in reserve, and therefore perhaps a\r\n",
      "trifle the more disconcerted at the way in which, in spite of this fine\r\n",
      "example of it, she hesitated. \"There's one thing, of course,\" I\r\n",
      "went on: \"they mustn't, before she goes, see each other for three\r\n",
      "seconds.\" Then it came over me that, in spite of Flora's presumable\r\n",
      "sequestration from the instant of her return from the pool, it might\r\n",
      "already be too late. \"Do you mean,\" I anxiously asked, \"that they\r\n",
      "_have_ met?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this she quite flushed. \"Ah, Miss, I'm not such a fool as\r\n",
      "that! If I've been obliged to leave her three or four times, it has\r\n",
      "been each time with one of the maids, and at present, though she's\r\n",
      "alone, she's locked in safe. And yet--and yet!\" There were too many\r\n",
      "things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not sure of anything but _you_. But I have, since last\r\n",
      "evening, a new hope. I think he wants to give me an opening. I do\r\n",
      "believe that--poor little exquisite wretch!--he wants to speak. Last\r\n",
      "evening, in the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours\r\n",
      "as if it were just coming.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grose looked hard, through the window, at the grey, gathering\r\n",
      "day. \"And did it come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, though I waited and waited, I confess it didn't, and it\r\n",
      "was without a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion\r\n",
      "to his sister's condition and absence that we at last kissed for\r\n",
      "good-night. All the same,\" I continued, \"I can't, if her uncle\r\n",
      "sees her, consent to his seeing her brother without my having given\r\n",
      "the boy--and most of all because things have got so bad--a little more\r\n",
      "time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My friend appeared on this ground more reluctant than I could quite\r\n",
      "understand. \"What do you mean by more time?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, a day or two--really to bring it out. He'll then be on _my_\r\n",
      "side--of which you see the importance. If nothing comes, I shall only\r\n",
      "fail, and you will, at the worst, have helped me by doing, on your\r\n",
      "arrival in town, whatever you may have found possible.\" So I put it\r\n",
      "before her, but she continued for a little so inscrutably embarrassed\r\n",
      "that I came again to her aid. \"Unless, indeed,\" I wound up, \"you\r\n",
      "really want _not_ to go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could see it, in her face, at last clear itself; she put out her hand\r\n",
      "to me as a pledge. \"I'll go--I'll go. I'll go this morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Yet it was when she had got off--and I missed her on the spot--that\r\n",
      "the great pinch really came. If I had counted on what it would give\r\n",
      "me to find myself alone with Miles, I speedily perceived, at least,\r\n",
      "that it would give me a measure. No hour of my stay in fact was so\r\n",
      "assailed with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that\r\n",
      "the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already\r\n",
      "rolled out of the gates. Now I _was_, I said to myself, face to face\r\n",
      "with the elements, and for much of the rest of the day, while I fought\r\n",
      "my weakness, I could consider that I had been supremely rash. It was a\r\n",
      "tighter place still than I had yet turned round in; all the more that,\r\n",
      "for the first time, I could see in the aspect of others a confused\r\n",
      "reflection of the crisis. What had happened naturally caused them all\r\n",
      "to stare; there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever we\r\n",
      "might, in the suddenness of my colleague's act. The maids and the men\r\n",
      "looked blank; the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until\r\n",
      "I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid. It was precisely,\r\n",
      "in short, by just clutching the helm that I avoided total wreck; and\r\n",
      "I dare say that, to bear up at all, I became, that morning, very grand\r\n",
      "and very dry. I welcomed the consciousness that I was charged with much\r\n",
      "to do, and I caused it to be known as well that, left thus to myself,\r\n",
      "I was quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that manner, for the next\r\n",
      "hour or two, all over the place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I\r\n",
      "were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern,\r\n",
      "I paraded with a sick heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner,\r\n",
      "little Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no\r\n",
      "glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change\r\n",
      "taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the\r\n",
      "piano, the day before, kept me, in Flora's interest, so beguiled\r\n",
      "and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by\r\n",
      "her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered\r\n",
      "in by our non-observance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. He\r\n",
      "had already disappeared when, on my way down, I pushed open his door,\r\n",
      "and I learned below that he had breakfasted--in the presence of a\r\n",
      "couple of the maids--with Mrs. Grose and his sister. He had then gone\r\n",
      "out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected, could\r\n",
      "better have expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of\r\n",
      "my office. What he would now permit this office to consist of was yet\r\n",
      "to be settled: there was a queer relief, at all events--I mean for\r\n",
      "myself in especial--in the renouncement of one pretension. If so much\r\n",
      "had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too strongly in saying that\r\n",
      "what had perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging\r\n",
      "the fiction that I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently\r\n",
      "stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself\r\n",
      "he carried out the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to\r\n",
      "let me off straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He\r\n",
      "had at any rate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I\r\n",
      "had amply shown, moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom\r\n",
      "the previous night, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval\r\n",
      "just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this\r\n",
      "moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived the difficulty of\r\n",
      "applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight\r\n",
      "home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred\r\n",
      "had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that\r\n",
      "my meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs;\r\n",
      "so that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room\r\n",
      "outside of the window of which I had had from Mrs. Grose, that first\r\n",
      "scared Sunday, my flash of something it would scarce have done to call\r\n",
      "light. Here at present I felt afresh--for I had felt it again and\r\n",
      "again--how my equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid will,\r\n",
      "the will to shut my eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what\r\n",
      "I had to deal with was, revoltingly, against nature. I could only get\r\n",
      "on at all by taking \"nature\" into my confidence and my account,\r\n",
      "by treating my monstrous ordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of\r\n",
      "course, and unpleasant, but demanding, after all, for a fair front,\r\n",
      "only another turn of the screw of ordinary human virtue. No attempt,\r\n",
      "none the less, could well require more tact than just this attempt\r\n",
      "to supply, one's self, _all_ the nature. How could I put even a\r\n",
      "little of that article into a suppression of reference to what had\r\n",
      "occurred? How, on the other hand, could I make a reference without a\r\n",
      "new plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a\r\n",
      "time, had come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met,\r\n",
      "incontestably, by the quickened vision of what was rare in my little\r\n",
      "companion. It was indeed as if he had found even now--as he had\r\n",
      "so often found at lessons--still some other delicate way to ease me\r\n",
      "off. Wasn't there light in the fact which, as we shared our solitude,\r\n",
      "broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite worn?--the\r\n",
      "fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had now come)\r\n",
      "it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forgo the help\r\n",
      "one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his intelligence\r\n",
      "been given him for but to save him? Mightn't one, to reach his mind,\r\n",
      "risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character? It was as if,\r\n",
      "when we were face to face in the dining-room, he had literally shown me\r\n",
      "the way. The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with\r\n",
      "attendance. Miles, before he sat down, stood a moment with his hands\r\n",
      "in his pockets and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on the point\r\n",
      "of passing some humorous judgment. But what he presently produced was:\r\n",
      "\"I say, my dear, is she really very awfully ill?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Little Flora? Not so bad but that she'll presently be better.\r\n",
      "London will set her up. Bly had ceased to agree with her. Come\r\n",
      "here and take your mutton.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and,\r\n",
      "when he was established, went on. \"Did Bly disagree with her so\r\n",
      "terribly suddenly?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not so suddenly as you might think. One had seen it coming on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why didn't you get her off before?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Before what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Before she became too ill to travel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I found myself prompt. \"She's _not_ too ill to travel: she only\r\n",
      "might have become so if she had stayed. This was just the moment\r\n",
      "to seize. The journey will dissipate the influence\"--oh, I was\r\n",
      "grand!--\"and carry it off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see, I see\"--Miles, for that matter, was grand too. He settled\r\n",
      "to his repast with the charming little \"table manner\" that,\r\n",
      "from the day of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness of\r\n",
      "admonition. Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not\r\n",
      "for ugly feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, today; but he was\r\n",
      "unmistakeably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for\r\n",
      "granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy;\r\n",
      "and he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation. Our\r\n",
      "meal was of the briefest--mine a vain pretence, and I had the things\r\n",
      "immediately removed. While this was done Miles stood again with his\r\n",
      "hands in his little pockets and his back to me--stood and looked out of\r\n",
      "the wide window through which, that other day, I had seen what pulled\r\n",
      "me up. We continued silent while the maid was with us--as silent,\r\n",
      "it whimsically occurred to me, as some young couple who, on their\r\n",
      "wedding-journey, at the inn, feel shy in the presence of the waiter. He\r\n",
      "turned round only when the waiter had left us. \"Well--so we're\r\n",
      "alone!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XXIII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, more or less.\" I fancy my smile was pale. \"Not absolutely.\r\n",
      "We shouldn't like that!\" I went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--I suppose we shouldn't. Of course we have the others.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We have the others--we have indeed the others,\" I concurred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yet even though we have them,\" he returned, still with his hands\r\n",
      "in his pockets and planted there in front of me, \"they don't much\r\n",
      "count, do they?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I made the best of it, but I felt wan. \"It depends on what you call\r\n",
      "'much'!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes\"--with all accommodation--\"everything depends!\" On this,\r\n",
      "however, he faced to the window again and presently reached it with\r\n",
      "his vague, restless, cogitating step. He remained there awhile, with\r\n",
      "his forehead against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs\r\n",
      "I knew and the dull things of November. I had always my hypocrisy of\r\n",
      "\"work,\" behind which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying myself with\r\n",
      "it there as I had repeatedly done at those moments of torment that I\r\n",
      "have described as the moments of my knowing the children to be given to\r\n",
      "something from which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of\r\n",
      "being prepared for the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped\r\n",
      "on me as I extracted a meaning from the boy's embarrassed back--none\r\n",
      "other than the impression that I was not barred now. This inference\r\n",
      "grew in a few minutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the\r\n",
      "direct perception that it was positively _he_ who was. The frames and\r\n",
      "squares of the great window were a kind of image, for him, of a kind of\r\n",
      "failure. I felt that I saw him, at any rate, shut in or shut out. He\r\n",
      "was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a throb of\r\n",
      "hope. Wasn't he looking, through the haunted pane, for something he\r\n",
      "couldn't see?--and wasn't it the first time in the whole business\r\n",
      "that he had known such a lapse? The first, the very first: I found it\r\n",
      "a splendid portent. It made him anxious, though he watched himself;\r\n",
      "he had been anxious all day and, even while in his usual sweet little\r\n",
      "manner he sat at table, had needed all his small strange genius to give\r\n",
      "it a gloss. When he at last turned round to meet me, it was almost as\r\n",
      "if this genius had succumbed. \"Well, I think I'm glad Bly agrees\r\n",
      "with _me_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours,\r\n",
      "a good deal more of it than for some time before. I hope,\" I went on\r\n",
      "bravely, \"that you've been enjoying yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, I've been ever so far; all round about--miles and miles\r\n",
      "away. I've never been so free.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had really a manner of his own, and I could only try to keep up with\r\n",
      "him. \"Well, do you like it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood there smiling; then at last he put into two words--\"Do\r\n",
      "_you_?\"--more discrimination than I had ever heard two words\r\n",
      "contain. Before I had time to deal with that, however, he\r\n",
      "continued as if with the sense that this was an impertinence to be\r\n",
      "softened. \"Nothing could be more charming than the way you take it,\r\n",
      "for of course if we're alone together now it's you that are alone\r\n",
      "most. But I hope,\" he threw in, \"you don't particularly mind!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Having to do with you?\" I asked. \"My dear child, how can I help\r\n",
      "minding? Though I've renounced all claim to your company,--you're\r\n",
      "so beyond me,--I at least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay\r\n",
      "on for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at me more directly, and the expression of his face, graver\r\n",
      "now, struck me as the most beautiful I had ever found in it. \"You\r\n",
      "stay on just for _that_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly. I stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest\r\n",
      "I take in you till something can be done for you that may be more worth\r\n",
      "your while. That needn't surprise you.\" My voice trembled so that I\r\n",
      "felt it impossible to suppress the shake. \"Don't you remember how I\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "the assumption on which my action had been founded; but what he finally\r\n",
      "said was: \"Do you mean now--here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There couldn't be a better place or time.\" He looked round him\r\n",
      "uneasily, and I had the rare--oh, the queer!--impression of the very\r\n",
      "first symptom I had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear. It\r\n",
      "was as if he were suddenly afraid of me--which struck me indeed as\r\n",
      "perhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the very pang of the effort\r\n",
      "I felt it vain to try sternness, and I heard myself the next instant so\r\n",
      "gentle as to be almost grotesque. \"You want so to go out again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Awfully!\" He smiled at me heroically, and the touching little\r\n",
      "bravery of it was enhanced by his actually flushing with pain. He\r\n",
      "had picked up his hat, which he had brought in, and stood twirling\r\n",
      "it in a way that gave me, even as I was just nearly reaching port, a\r\n",
      "perverse horror of what I was doing. To do it in _any_ way was an act\r\n",
      "of violence, for what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea\r\n",
      "of grossness and guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for\r\n",
      "me a revelation of the possibilities of beautiful intercourse? Wasn't\r\n",
      "it base to create for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? I\r\n",
      "suppose I now read into our situation a clearness it couldn't have\r\n",
      "had at the time, for I seem to see our poor eyes already lighted\r\n",
      "with some spark of a prevision of the anguish that was to come. So\r\n",
      "we circled about, with terrors and scruples, like fighters not daring\r\n",
      "to close. But it was for each other we feared! That kept us a little\r\n",
      "longer suspended and unbruised. \"I'll tell you everything,\"\r\n",
      "Miles said--\"I mean I'll tell you anything you like. You'll stay\r\n",

      "in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin\r\n",
      "drop. Then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom,\r\n",
      "outside, someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. \"I\r\n",
      "have to see Luke.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "My sense of how he received this suffered for a minute from something\r\n",
      "that I can describe only as a fierce split of my attention--a stroke\r\n",
      "that at first, as I sprang straight up, reduced me to the mere blind\r\n",
      "movement of getting hold of him, drawing him close, and, while I just\r\n",
      "fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctively\r\n",
      "keeping him with his back to the window. The appearance was full upon\r\n",
      "us that I had already had to deal with here: Peter Quint had come into\r\n",
      "view like a sentinel before a prison. The next thing I saw was that,\r\n",
      "from outside, he had reached the window, and then I knew that, close to\r\n",
      "the glass and glaring in through it, he offered once more to the room\r\n",
      "his white face of damnation. It represents but grossly what took place\r\n",
      "within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made;\r\n",
      "yet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time\r\n",
      "recovered her grasp of the _act_. It came to me in the very horror of\r\n",
      "the immediate presence that the act would be, seeing and facing what\r\n",
      "I saw and faced, to keep the boy himself unaware. The inspiration--I\r\n",
      "can call it by no other name--was that I felt how voluntarily, how\r\n",
      "transcendently, I _might_. It was like fighting with a demon for a\r\n",
      "human soul, and when I had fairly so appraised it I saw how the human\r\n",
      "soul--held out, in the tremor of my hands, at arm's length--had a\r\n",
      "perfect dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead. The face that was\r\n",
      "close to mine was as white as the face against the glass, and out of it\r\n",
      "presently came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from much further\r\n",
      "away, that I drank like a waft of fragrance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--I took it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew him close; and while I\r\n",
      "held him to my breast, where I could feel in the sudden fever of his\r\n",
      "little body the tremendous pulse of his little heart, I kept my eyes\r\n",
      "on the thing at the window and saw it move and shift its posture. I\r\n",
      "have likened it to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment, was\r\n",
      "rather the prowl of a baffled beast. My present quickened courage,\r\n",
      "however, was such that, not too much to let it through, I had to shade,\r\n",
      "as it were, my flame. Meanwhile the glare of the face was again at\r\n",
      "the window, the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. It was the\r\n",
      "very confidence that I might now defy him, as well as the positive\r\n",
      "certitude, by this time, of the child's unconsciousness, that made me\r\n",

      "was the ravage of uneasiness. What was prodigious was that at last,\r\n",
      "by my success, his sense was sealed and his communication stopped:\r\n",
      "he knew that he was in presence, but knew not of what, and knew still\r\n",
      "less that I also was and that I did know. And what did this strain of\r\n",
      "trouble matter when my eyes went back to the window only to see that\r\n",
      "the air was clear again and--by my personal triumph--the influence\r\n",
      "quenched? There was nothing there. I felt that the cause was mine and\r\n",
      "that I should surely get _all_. \"And you found nothing!\"--I let my\r\n",
      "elation out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave the most mournful, thoughtful little headshake. \"Nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing, nothing,\" he sadly repeated.\r\n",

      "did reach him. \"Did I _steal_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it\r\n",
      "were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him\r\n",
      "take it with allowances that gave the very distance of his fall in the\r\n",
      "world. \"Was it for that you mightn't go back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise. \"Did you\r\n",

      "Miles could, very simply. \"No. I didn't steal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My face must have shown him I believed him utterly; yet my hands--but\r\n",
      "it was for pure tenderness--shook him as if to ask him why, if it was\r\n",
      "all for nothing, he had condemned me to months of torment. \"What then\r\n",
      "did you do?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his\r\n",
      "breath, two or three times over, as if with difficulty. He might have\r\n",
      "been standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some\r\n",
      "faint green twilight. \"Well--I said things.\"\r\n",

      "don't know!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He almost smiled at me in the desolation of his surrender, which was\r\n",
      "indeed practically, by this time, so complete that I ought to have left\r\n",
      "it there. But I was infatuated--I was blind with victory, though even\r\n",
      "then the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was\r\n",
      "already that of added separation. \"Was it to everyone?\" I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; it was only to----\" But he gave a sick little headshake. \"I\r\n",

      "\"Were they then so many?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "obscure, and within a minute there had come to me out of my very pity\r\n",
      "the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent. It was for the\r\n",
      "instant confounding and bottomless, for if he _were_ innocent, what\r\n",
      "then on earth was _I_? Paralysed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of\r\n",
      "the question, I let him go a little, so that, with a deep-drawn sigh,\r\n",
      "he turned away from me again; which, as he faced toward the clear\r\n",
      "window, I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there to keep\r\n",
      "him from. \"And did they repeat what you said?\" I went on after\r\n",
      "a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was soon at some distance from me, still breathing hard and again\r\n",
      "with the air, though now without anger for it, of being confined\r\n",
      "against his will. Once more, as he had done before, he looked up at the\r\n",
      "dim day as if, of what had hitherto sustained him, nothing was left but\r\n",
      "an unspeakable anxiety. \"Oh, yes,\" he nevertheless replied--\"they\r\n",
      "must have repeated them. To those _they_ liked,\" he added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was, somehow, less of it than I had expected; but I turned it\r\n",
      "over. \"And these things came round----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the masters? Oh, yes!\" he answered very simply. \"But I\r\n",
      "didn't know they'd tell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The masters? They didn't--they've never told. That's why I\r\n",

      "\"Too bad?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "and an irrepressible cry, spring straight upon him. For there again,\r\n",
      "against the glass, as if to blight his confession and stay his answer,\r\n",
      "was the hideous author of our woe--the white face of damnation. I\r\n",
      "felt a sick swim at the drop of my victory and all the return of my\r\n",
      "battle, so that the wildness of my veritable leap only served as a\r\n",
      "great betrayal. I saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with\r\n",
      "a divination, and on the perception that even now he only guessed,\r\n",
      "and that the window was still to his own eyes free, I let the impulse\r\n",
      "flame up to convert the climax of his dismay into the very proof of his\r\n",
      "liberation. \"No more, no more, no more!\" I shrieked, as I tried to\r\n",
      "press him against me, to my visitant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is she _here_?\" Miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the\r\n",
      "direction of my words. Then as his strange \"she\" staggered me and,\r\n",
      "with a gasp, I echoed it, \"Miss Jessel, Miss Jessel!\" he with a\r\n",

      "better still than that. \"It's not Miss Jessel! But it's at the\r\n",

      "vainly over the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense,\r\n",
      "filled the room like the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming\r\n",
      "presence. \"It's _he_?\"\r\n",

      "more her voice reached him and once more he gossiped back. \"Coming\r\n",
      "up too? Not if you'll kindly indulge me, mum--I must be where I can\r\n",
      "watch the bell. It takes watching as well as hearing!\"--he dropped,\r\n",
      "as he resumed his round, to a murmur of great patience. This was taken\r\n",
      "up the next moment by the husky plaint of the signal itself, which\r\n",
      "seemed to confess equally to short wind and creaking joints. It moved,\r\n",
      "however, distinguishably, and its motion made him start much more as\r\n",
      "if he had been guilty of sleeping at his post than as if he had waited\r\n",
      "half the day. \"Mercy, if I _didn't_ watch----!\" He shuffled\r\n",
      "across the wide stone-paved hall and, losing himself beneath the great\r\n",
      "arch of the short passage to the entrance-front, hastened to admit his\r\n",
      "new visitor. He gives us thereby the use of his momentary absence for a\r\n",
      "look at the place he has left.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is the central hall, high and square, brown and grey, flagged\r\n",
      "beneath and timbered above, of an old English country-house; an\r\n",
      "apartment in which a single survey is a perception of long and lucky\r\n",
      "continuities. It would have been difficult to find elsewhere anything\r\n",
      "at once so old and so actual, anything that had plainly come so far,\r\n",
      "far down without, at any moment of the endless journey, losing its\r\n",
      "way. To stand there and look round was to wonder a good deal--yet\r\n",
      "without arriving at an answer--whether it had been most neglected or\r\n",
      "most cherished; there was such resignation in its long survival and yet\r\n",
      "such bravery in its high polish. If it had never been spoiled, this\r\n",
      "was partly, no doubt, because it had been, for a century, given up;\r\n",
      "but what it had been given up to was, after all, homely and familiar\r\n",
      "use. It had in it at the present moment indeed much of the chill of\r\n",
      "fallen fortunes; but there was no concession in its humility and no\r\n",
      "hypocrisy in its welcome. It was magnificent and shabby, and the eyes\r\n",
      "of the dozen dark old portraits seemed, in their eternal attention, to\r\n",
      "count the cracks in the pavement, the rents in the seats of the chairs,\r\n",
      "and the missing tones in the Flemish tapestry. Above the tapestry,\r\n",
      "which, in its turn, was above the high oak wainscot, most of these\r\n",
      "stiff images--on the side on which it principally reigned--were placed;\r\n",
      "and they held up their heads to assure all comers that a tone or two\r\n",
      "was all that _was_ missing, and that they had never waked up in winter\r\n",
      "dawns to any glimmer of bereavement, in the long night, of any relic or\r\n",
      "any feature. Such as it was, the company was all there; every inch of\r\n",
      "old oak, every yard of old arras, every object of ornament or of use\r\n",
      "to which these surfaces formed so rare a background. If the watchers\r\n",
      "on the walls had ever found a gap in their own rank, the ancient roof,\r\n",
      "of a certainty, would have been shaken by their collective gasp. As\r\n",
      "a matter of fact it was rich and firm--it had almost the dignity of\r\n",
      "the vault of a church. On this Saturday afternoon in August, a hot,\r\n",
      "still day, such of the casements as freely worked in the discoloured\r\n",
      "glass of the windows stood open in one quarter to a terrace that\r\n",
      "overlooked a park and in another to a wonderful old empty court that\r\n",
      "communicated with a wonderful old empty garden. The staircase, wide and\r\n",
      "straight, mounted, full in sight, to a landing that was half-way up;\r\n",
      "and on the right, as you faced this staircase, a door opened out of\r\n",
      "the brown panelling into a glimpse of a little morning-room, where,\r\n",
      "in a slanted, gilded light, there was brownness too, mixed with notes\r\n",
      "of old yellow. On the left, toward court and garden, another door stood\r\n",
      "open to the warm air. Still as you faced the staircase you had at your\r\n",
      "right, between that monument and the morning-room, the arch through\r\n",
      "which Chivers had disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His reappearance interrupts and yet in a manner, after all, quickens\r\n",
      "our intense impression; Chivers on the spot, and in this severe but\r\n",
      "spacious setting, was so perfect an image of immemorial domesticity. It\r\n",
      "would have been impossible perhaps, however, either to tell his age\r\n",
      "or to name his use: he was of the age of all the history that lurked\r\n",
      "in all the corners and of any use whatever you might be so good as\r\n",
      "still to find for him. Considerably shrunken and completely silvered,\r\n",
      "he had perpetual agreement in the droop of his kind white head and\r\n",
      "perpetual inquiry in the jerk of the idle old hands now almost covered\r\n",
      "by the sleeves of the black dress-coat which, twenty years before,\r\n",
      "must have been by a century or two the newest thing in the house and\r\n",
      "into which his years appeared to have declined very much as a shrunken\r\n",
      "family moves into a part of its habitation. This attire was completed\r\n",
      "by a white necktie that, in honour of the day, he himself had this\r\n",
      "morning done up. The humility he betrayed and the oddity he concealed\r\n",
      "were alike brought out by his juxtaposition with the gentleman he had\r\n",
      "admitted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To admit Mr. Prodmore was anywhere and at any time, as you would\r\n",
      "immediately have recognised, an immense admission. He was a personage\r\n",
      "of great presence and weight, with a large smooth face in which\r\n",
      "a small sharp meaning was planted like a single pin in the tight\r\n",
      "red toilet-cushion of a guest-chamber. He wore a blue frock-coat\r\n",
      "and a stiff white waistcoat and a high white hat that he kept on\r\n",
      "his head with a kind of protesting cock, while in his buttonhole\r\n",
      "nestled a bold prize plant on which he occasionally lowered a\r\n",
      "proprietary eye that seemed to remind it of its being born to a public\r\n",
      "career. Mr. Prodmore's appearance had evidently been thought out,\r\n",
      "but it might have struck you that the old portraits took it in with\r\n",
      "a sterner stare, with a fixedness indeed in which a visitor more\r\n",
      "sensitive would have read a consciousness of his remaining, in their\r\n",
      "presence, so jauntily, so vulgarly covered. He had never a glance for\r\n",
      "them, and it would have been easy after a minute to see that this was\r\n",
      "an old story between them. Their manner, as it were, sensibly increased\r\n",
      "the coolness. This coolness became a high rigour as Mr. Prodmore\r\n",
      "encountered, from the very threshold, a disappointment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No one here?\" he indignantly demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sorry to say no one has come, sir,\" Chivers replied; \"but\r\n",
      "I've had a telegram from Captain Yule.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore's apprehension flared out. \"Not to say he ain't\r\n",
      "coming?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He was to take the 2.20 from Paddington; he certainly _should_\r\n",
      "be here!\" The old man spoke as if his non-arrival were the most\r\n",
      "unaccountable thing in the world, especially for a poor person ever\r\n",
      "respectful of the mystery of causes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He should have been here this hour or more. And so should my\r\n",
      "fly-away daughter!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers surrounded this description of Miss Prodmore with the deep\r\n",
      "discretion of silence, and then, after a moment, evidently reflected\r\n",
      "that silence, in a world bestrewn with traps to irreverence, might be\r\n",
      "as rash as speech. \"Were they coming--a--together, sir?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had scarcely mended the matter, for his visitor gave an inconsequent\r\n",
      "stare. \"Together?--for what do you take Miss Prodmore?\" This young\r\n",
      "lady's parent glared about him again as if to alight on something\r\n",
      "else that was out of place; but the good intentions expressed in the\r\n",
      "attitude of every object might presently have been presumed to soothe\r\n",
      "his irritation. It had at any rate the effect of bridging, for poor\r\n",
      "Chivers, some of his gaps. \"It _is_ in a sense true that their\r\n",
      "'coming together,' as you call it, is exactly what I've made\r\n",
      "my plans for today: my calculation was that we should all punctually\r\n",
      "converge on this spot. Attended by her trusty maid, Miss Prodmore, who\r\n",
      "happens to be on a week's visit to her grandmother at Bellborough,\r\n",
      "was to take the 1.40 from that place. I was to drive over--ten\r\n",
      "miles--from the most convenient of my seats. Captain Yule\"--the\r\n",
      "speaker wound up his statement as with the mention of the last touch in\r\n",
      "a masterpiece of his own sketching--\"was finally to shake off for a\r\n",
      "few hours the peculiar occupations that engage him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man listened with his head askance to favour his good ear, but\r\n",
      "his visible attention all on a sad spot in one of the half-dozen worn\r\n",
      "rugs. \"They _must_ be peculiar, sir, when a gentleman comes into a\r\n",
      "property like this and goes three months without so much as a nat'ral\r\n",
      "curiosity----! I don't speak of anything but what _is_ nat'ral,\r\n",
      "sir; but there have _been_ people here----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There have repeatedly been people here!\" Mr. Prodmore complacently\r\n",
      "interrupted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As you say, sir--to be shown over. With the master himself never\r\n",
      "shown!\" Chivers dismally commented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He _shall_ be, so that nobody can miss him!\" Mr. Prodmore, for his\r\n",
      "own reassurance as well, hastened to retort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion risked a tiny explanation. \"It will be a mercy indeed\r\n",
      "to look on him; but I meant that he has not been taken round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's what I meant too. _I'll_ take him--round and round:\r\n",
      "it's exactly what I've come for!\" Mr. Prodmore rang out; and his\r\n",
      "eyes made the lower circuit again, looking as pleased as such a pair of\r\n",
      "eyes could look with nobody as yet quite good enough either to terrify\r\n",
      "or to tickle. \"He can't fail to be affected, though he _has_ been\r\n",
      "up to his neck in such a different class of thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers clearly wondered awhile what class of thing it could be. Then\r\n",
      "he expressed a timid hope. \"In nothing, I dare say, but what's\r\n",
      "right, sir----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In everything,\" Mr. Prodmore distinctly informed him, \"that's\r\n",
      "wrong! But here he is!\" that gentleman added with elation as\r\n",
      "the doorbell again sounded. Chivers, under the double agitation of\r\n",
      "the appeal and the disclosure, proceeded to the front as fast as\r\n",
      "circumstances allowed; while Mr. Prodmore, left alone, would have\r\n",
      "been observed--had not his solitude been so bleak--to recover a\r\n",
      "degree of cheerfulness. Cheerfulness in solitude at Covering End was\r\n",
      "certainly not irresistible, but particular feelings and reasons had\r\n",
      "pitched, for their campaign, the starched, if now somewhat ruffled,\r\n",
      "tent of his large white waistcoat. If they had issued audibly from\r\n",
      "that pavilion, they would have represented to us his consciousness\r\n",
      "of the reinforcement he might bring up for attack should Captain\r\n",
      "Yule really resist the house. The sound he next heard from the front\r\n",
      "caused him none the less, for that matter, to articulate a certain\r\n",
      "drop. \"Only Cora?--Well,\" he added in a tone somewhat at variance\r\n",
      "with his \"only,\" \"he shan't, at any rate, resist _her_!\"\r\n",
      "This announcement would have quickened a spectator's interest in\r\n",
      "the young lady whom Chivers now introduced and followed, a young\r\n",
      "lady who straightway found herself the subject of traditionary\r\n",
      "discipline. \"I've waited. What do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora Prodmore, who had a great deal of colour in her cheeks and a great\r\n",
      "deal more--a bold variety of kinds--in the extremely high pitch of\r\n",
      "her new, smart clothes, meant, on the whole, it was easy to see, very\r\n",
      "little, and met this challenge with still less show of support either\r\n",
      "from the sources I have mentioned or from any others. A dull, fresh,\r\n",
      "honest, overdressed damsel of two-and-twenty, she was too much out\r\n",
      "of breath, too much flurried and frightened, to do more than stammer:\r\n",
      "\"Waited, papa? Oh, I'm sorry!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her regret appeared to strike her father still more as an impertinence\r\n",
      "than as a vanity. \"Would you then, if I had not had patience for you,\r\n",
      "have wished not to find me? Why the dickens are you so late?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Agitated, embarrassed, the girl was at a loss. \"I'll tell you,\r\n",
      "papa!\" But she followed up her pledge with an air of vacuity and\r\n",
      "then, dropping into the nearest seat, simply closed her eyes to her\r\n",
      "danger. If she desired relief, she had caught at the one way to get\r\n",
      "it. \"I feel rather faint. Could I have some tea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore considered both the idea and his daughter's substantial\r\n",
      "form. \"Well, as I shall expect you to put forth _all_ your\r\n",
      "powers--yes!\" He turned to Chivers. \"Some tea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man's eyes had attached themselves to Miss Prodmore's\r\n",
      "symptoms with more solicitude than those of her parent. \"I did\r\n",
      "think it might be required!\" Then as he gained the door of the\r\n",
      "morning-room: \"I'll lay it out here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young lady, on his withdrawal, recovered herself sufficiently to\r\n",
      "rise again. \"It was my train, papa--so very awfully behind. I walked\r\n",
      "up, you know, also, from the station--there's such a lovely footpath\r\n",
      "across the park.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've been roaming the country then alone?\" Mr. Prodmore\r\n",
      "inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl protested with instant eagerness against any such\r\n",
      "picture. \"Oh, dear no, not _alone_!\" She spoke, absurdly, as if she\r\n",
      "had had a train of attendants; but it was an instant before she could\r\n",
      "complete the assurance. \"There were ever so many people about.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing is more possible than that there should be _too_\r\n",
      "many!\" said her father, speaking as for his personal convenience,\r\n",
      "but presenting that as enough. \"But where, among them all,\" he\r\n",
      "demanded, \"is your trusty maid?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora's reply made up in promptitude what it lacked in felicity. \"I\r\n",
      "didn't bring her.\" She looked at the old portraits as if to appeal\r\n",
      "to them to help her to remember why. Apparently indeed they gave a\r\n",
      "sign, for she presently went on: \"She was so extremely unwell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore met this with reprobation. \"Wasn't she to understand\r\n",
      "from the first that we don't permit----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Anything of that sort?\"--the girl recalled it at least as a\r\n",
      "familiar law. \"Oh, yes, papa--I _thought_ she did.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But she doesn't?\"--Mr. Prodmore pressed the point. Poor Cora, at\r\n",
      "a loss again, appeared to wonder if the point had better be a failure\r\n",
      "of brain or of propriety, but her companion continued to press. \"What\r\n",
      "on earth's the matter with her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She again communed with their silent witnesses. \"I really don't\r\n",
      "quite know, but I think that at Granny's she eats too much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll soon put an end to _that_!\" Mr. Prodmore returned with\r\n",
      "decision. \"You expect then to pursue your adventures quite into the\r\n",
      "night--to return to Bellborough as you came?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl had by this time begun a little to find her feet. \"Exactly\r\n",
      "as I came, papa dear,--under the protection of a new friend I've just\r\n",
      "made, a lady whom I met in the train and who is also going back by the\r\n",
      "6.19. She was, like myself, on her way to this place, and I expected to\r\n",
      "find her here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore chilled on the spot any such expectations. \"What does\r\n",
      "she want at this place?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora was clearly stronger for her new friend than for herself. \"She\r\n",
      "wants to see it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore reflected on this complication. \"Today?\" It was\r\n",
      "practically presumptuous. \"Today won't do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So I suggested,\" the girl declared. \"But do you know what she\r\n",
      "said?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How should I know,\" he coldly demanded, \"what a nobody says?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But on this, as if with the returning taste of a new strength, his\r\n",
      "daughter could categorically meet him. \"She's not a nobody. She's\r\n",
      "an American.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, for a moment, was struck: he embraced the place,\r\n",
      "instinctively, in a flash of calculation. \"An American?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and she's wild----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He knew all about that. \"Americans mostly _are_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean,\" said Cora, \"to see this place. 'Wild' was what she\r\n",
      "herself called it--and I think she also said she was 'mad.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She gave\"--Mr. Prodmore reviewed the affair--\"a fine account of\r\n",
      "herself! But she won't do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect of her new acquaintance on his companion had been such that\r\n",
      "she could, after an instant, react against this sentence. \"Well,\r\n",
      "when I told her that this particular day perhaps wouldn't, she said\r\n",
      "it would just _have_ to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have to do?\" Mr. Prodmore showed again, through a chink, his\r\n",
      "speculative eye. \"For _what_, then, with such grand airs?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, I suppose, for what Americans want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He measured the quantity. \"They want everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I wonder,\" said Cora, \"that she hasn't arrived.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When she does arrive,\" he answered, \"I'll tackle her; and I\r\n",
      "shall thank you, in future, not to take up, in trains, with indelicate\r\n",
      "women of whom you know nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I did know something,\" his daughter pleaded; \"for I saw her\r\n",
      "yesterday at Bellborough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore contested even this freedom. \"And what was she doing at\r\n",
      "Bellborough?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Staying at the Blue Dragon, to see the old abbey. She says she just\r\n",
      "loves old abbeys. It seems to be the same feeling,\" the girl went on,\r\n",
      "\"that brought her over, today, to see this old house.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She 'just loves' old houses? Then why the deuce didn't she\r\n",
      "accompany you properly, since she is so pushing, to the door?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because she went off in a fly,\" Cora explained, \"to see, first,\r\n",
      "the old hospital. She just loves old hospitals. She asked me if this\r\n",
      "isn't a show-house. I told her\"--the girl was anxious to disclaim\r\n",
      "responsibility--\"that I hadn't the least idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It _is_!\" Mr. Prodmore cried almost with ferocity. \"I wonder,\r\n",
      "on such a speech, what she thought of _you_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Prodmore meditated with distinct humbleness. \"I know. She told\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",

      "manner.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Prodmore's spirit was visibly rising, and a note that might\r\n",
      "have meant warning for warning sounded in the laugh produced by\r\n",
      "this sally. \"You speak of them, papa, as if they were sour little\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The colour that sprang into Cora's face at this rude comparison\r\n",
      "was such, unfortunately, as perhaps a little to justify it. Yet\r\n",

      "why, at the worst, such lightnings as she was thus able to dart\r\n",
      "shouldn't strike somewhere. If he had spoken to her of her best\r\n",
      "manner perhaps _that_ was her best manner. He heard steps and voices,\r\n",
      "however, and immediately invited to his aid his own, which was simply\r\n",
      "magnificent. Chivers, returning, announced solemnly \"Captain Yule!\"\r\n",
      "and ushered in a tall young man in a darkish tweed suit and a red\r\n",
      "necktie, attached in a sailor's knot, who, as he entered, removed\r\n",
      "a soft brown hat. Mr. Prodmore, at this, immediately saluted him by\r\n",
      "uncovering. \"Delighted at last to see you here!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the young man who first, in his comparative simplicity,\r\n",
      "put out a hand. \"If I've not come before, Mr. Prodmore, it\r\n",
      "was--very frankly speaking--from the dread of seeing _you_!\"\r\n",
      "His speech contradicted, to some extent, his gesture, but Clement\r\n",
      "Yule's was an aspect in which contradictions were rather remarkably\r\n",
      "at home. Erect and slender, but as strong as he was straight, he was\r\n",
      "set up, as the phrase is, like a soldier, and yet finished, in certain\r\n",
      "details--matters of expression and suggestion only indeed--like a man\r\n",
      "in whom sensibility had been recklessly cultivated. He was hard and\r\n",
      "fine, just as he was sharp and gentle, just as he was frank and shy,\r\n",
      "just as he was serious and young, just as he looked, though you could\r\n",
      "never have imitated it, distinctly \"kept up\" and yet considerably\r\n",
      "reduced. His features were thoroughly regular, but his complete\r\n",
      "shaving might have been designed to show that they were, after all,\r\n",
      "not absurd. The face Mr. Prodmore offered him fairly glowed, on this\r\n",
      "new showing, with instant pride of possession, and there was that in\r\n",
      "Captain Yule's whole air which justified such a sentiment without\r\n",
      "consciously rewarding it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, surely,\" said the elder man, \"my presence is not without\r\n",
      "a motive!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's just the motive,\" Captain Yule returned, \"that makes me\r\n",
      "wince at it! Certainly I've no illusions,\" he added, \"about the\r\n",
      "ground of our meeting. Your thorough knowledge of what you're about\r\n",
      "has placed me at your mercy--you hold me in the hollow of your hand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was vivid in every inch that Mr. Prodmore's was a nature to expand\r\n",
      "in the warmth, or even in the chill, of any tribute to his financial\r\n",
      "subtlety. \"Well, I won't, on my side, deny that when, in general,\r\n",
      "I go in deep I don't go in for nothing. I make it pay double!\" he\r\n",

      "arrived to do with his own. These fine points of expression literally\r\n",

      "up and down, round about and well over the scene, taking in, though\r\n",
      "at a mere glance, it might have seemed, more particularly, the row,\r\n",
      "high up, of strenuous ancestors. But Mr. Prodmore's last words rang\r\n",
      "none the less on his ear, and he met them with mild amusement. \"Pay\r\n",
      "off----? What can I pay off with?\"\r\n",

      "\"Oh, I've not taken--for the short run at least--the lucrative\r\n",
      "line,\" the young man said, \"and I know what you think of _that_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore's blandness confessed, by its instant increase, to\r\n",
      "this impeachment. There was always the glory of intimacy in Yule's\r\n",
      "knowing what he thought. \"I hold that you keep, in public, very\r\n",
      "dangerous company; but I also hold that you're extravagant mainly\r\n",
      "because you've nothing at stake. A man has the right opinions,\" he\r\n",
      "developed with pleasant confidence, \"as soon as he has something to\r\n",
      "lose by having the wrong. Haven't I already hinted to you how to set\r\n",
      "your political house in order? You drop into the lower regions because\r\n",
      "you keep the best rooms empty. You're a firebrand, in other words my\r\n",
      "dear Captain, simply because you're a bachelor. That's one of the\r\n",
      "early complaints we all pass through, but it's soon over, and the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\"I don't like jumping women,\" Captain Yule threw in; \"but that\r\n",
      "perhaps is a detail. It's more to the point that I've yet to see\r\n",
      "the woman whom, by an advance of my own----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'd care to keep in the really attractive position----?\"\r\n",

      "again--\"but that of waiting quietly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never, never anything!\" Mr. Prodmore, most assentingly, banished\r\n",

      "\"I _have_ thought it all over,\" Clement Yule said; \"and the\r\n",

      "darkness. I seem to make out, in the gloom of my meditations, that, at\r\n",
      "the worst, I can let the whole thing slide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The property?\"--Mr. Prodmore jerked back as if it were about to\r\n",
      "start.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't it the property,\" his visitor inquired, \"that positively\r\n",
      "throws me up? If I can afford neither to live on it nor to disencumber\r\n",
      "it, I can at least let it save its own bacon and pay its own debts. I\r\n",
      "can say to you simply: 'Take it, my dear sir, and the devil take\r\n",
      "_you_!'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore gave a quick, strained smile. \"You wouldn't be so\r\n",
      "shockingly rude!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not--if I'm a firebrand and a keeper of low company and a\r\n",
      "general nuisance? Sacrifice for sacrifice, that might very well be the\r\n",
      "least!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was put with such emphasis that Mr. Prodmore was for a moment\r\n",
      "arrested. He could stop very short, however, and yet talk as still\r\n",
      "going. \"How do you know, if you haven't compared them? It's just\r\n",
      "to make the comparison--in all the proper circumstances--that you're\r\n",
      "here at this hour.\" He took, with a large, though vague, exhibitory\r\n",
      "gesture, a few turns about. \"Now that you stretch yourself--for an\r\n",
      "hour's relaxation and rocked, as it were, by my friendly hand--in the\r\n",
      "ancient cradle of your race, can you seriously entertain the idea of\r\n",
      "parting with such a venerable family relic?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was evident that, as he decorously embraced the scene, the young\r\n",
      "man, in spite of this dissuasive tone, was entertaining ideas. It\r\n",
      "might have appeared at the moment to a spectator in whom fancy was\r\n",
      "at all alert that the place, becoming in a manner conscious of the\r\n",
      "question, felt itself on its honour, and that its honour could make\r\n",
      "no compromise. It met Clement Yule with no grimace of invitation,\r\n",
      "with no attenuation of its rich old sadness. It was as if the two\r\n",
      "hard spirits, the grim _genius loci_ and the quick modern conscience,\r\n",
      "stood an instant confronted. \"The cradle of my race bears, for me,\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, a striking resemblance to its tomb.\" The sigh that\r\n",
      "dropped from him, however, was not quite void of tenderness. It\r\n",
      "might, for that matter, have been a long, sad creak, portending\r\n",
      "collapse, of some immemorial support of the Yules. \"Heavens, how\r\n",
      "melancholy----!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, somewhat ambiguously, took up the sound. \"Melancholy?\"--he\r\n",
      "just balanced. That well might be, even a little _should_\r\n",
      "be--yet agreement might depreciate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Musty, mouldy;\" then with a poke of his stick at a gap in the\r\n",
      "stuff with which an old chair was covered, \"mangy!\" Captain Yule\r\n",
      "responded. \"Is this the character throughout?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore fixed a minute the tell-tale tatter. \"You must judge\r\n",
      "for yourself--you must go over the house.\" He hesitated again; then\r\n",
      "his indecision vanished--the right line was clear. \"It does look a\r\n",
      "bit run down, but I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll do it up for\r\n",
      "you--neatly: I'll throw _that_ in!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His young friend turned on him an eye that, though markedly enlivened\r\n",
      "by his offer, was somehow only the more inscrutable. \"Will you put in\r\n",
      "the electric light?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore's own twinkle--at this touch of a spring he had not\r\n",
      "expected to work--was, on the other hand, temporarily veiled. \"Well,\r\n",
      "if you'll meet me half-way! We're dealing here\"--he backed up his\r\n",
      "gravity--\"with fancy-values. Don't you feel,\" he appealed, \"as\r\n",
      "you take it all in, a kind of a something-or-other down your back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clement Yule gazed awhile at one of the pompous quarterings in the\r\n",
      "faded old glass that, in tones as of late autumn, crowned with armorial\r\n",
      "figures the top of the great hall-window; then with abruptness he\r\n",
      "turned away. \"Perhaps I _don't_ take it all in; but what I do feel\r\n",
      "is--since you mention it--a sort of stiffening of the spine! The whole\r\n",
      "thing is too queer--too cold--too cruel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Cruel?\"--Mr. Prodmore's demur was virtuous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like the face of some stuck-up distant relation who won't speak\r\n",
      "first. I see in the stare of the old dragon, I taste in his very\r\n",
      "breath, all the helpless mortality he has tucked away!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord, sir--you _have_ fancies!\" Mr. Prodmore was almost\r\n",
      "scandalised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the young man's fancies only multiplied as he moved, not at\r\n",
      "all critical, but altogether nervous, from object to object. \"I\r\n",
      "don't know what's the matter--but there _is_ more here than meets\r\n",
      "the eye.\" He tried as for his amusement or his relief to figure it\r\n",
      "out. \"I miss the old presences. I feel the old absences. I hear the\r\n",
      "old voices. I see the old ghosts.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This last was a profession that offered some common ground. \"The\r\n",
      "old ghosts, Captain Yule,\" his companion promptly replied, \"are\r\n",
      "worth so much a dozen, and with no reduction, I must remind you--with\r\n",
      "the price indeed rather raised--for the quantity taken!\" Feeling\r\n",
      "then apparently that he had cleared the air a little by this sally,\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore proceeded to pat his interlocutor on a back that he by no\r\n",
      "means wished to cause to be put to the wall. \"Look about you, at any\r\n",
      "rate, a little more.\" He crossed with his toes well out the line that\r\n",
      "divides encouragement from patronage. \"Do make yourself at home.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you very much, Mr. Prodmore. May I light a cigarette?\" his\r\n",
      "visitor asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In your own house, Captain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just the question: it seems so much less my own house\r\n",
      "than before I had come into it!\" The Captain offered Mr. Prodmore a\r\n",
      "cigarette which that gentleman, also taking a light from him, accepted;\r\n",
      "then he lit his own and began to smoke. \"As I understand you,\" he\r\n",
      "went on, \"you _lump_ your two conditions? I mean I must accept both\r\n",
      "or neither?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore threw back his shoulders with a high recognition of the\r\n",
      "long stride represented by this question. \"You _will_ accept both,\r\n",
      "for, by doing so, you'll clear the property at a stroke. The way\r\n",
      "I put it is--see?--that if you'll stand for Gossage, you'll get\r\n",
      "returned for Gossage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And if I get returned for Gossage, I shall marry your daughter.\r\n",
      "Accordingly,\" the young man pursued, \"if I marry your daughter----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll burn up, before your eyes,\" said this young lady's\r\n",
      "proprietor, \"every scratch of your pen. It will be a bonfire of\r\n",
      "signatures. There won't be a penny to pay--there'll only be a\r\n",
      "position to take. You'll take it with peculiar grace.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Peculiar, Mr. Prodmore--very!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man had assented more than he desired, but he was not\r\n",
      "deterred by it from completing the picture. \"You'll settle down\r\n",
      "here in comfort and honour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clement Yule took several steps; the effect of his host was the reverse\r\n",
      "of soothing; yet the latter watched his irritation as if it were the\r\n",
      "working of a charm. \"Are you very sure of the 'honour' if I turn\r\n",
      "my political coat?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll only be turning it back again to the way it was always\r\n",
      "worn. Gossage will receive you with open arms and press you to a\r\n",
      "heaving Tory bosom. That bosom\"--Mr. Prodmore followed himself\r\n",
      "up--\"has never heaved but to sound Conservative principles. The\r\n",
      "cradle, as I've called it,--or at least the rich, warm coverlet,--of\r\n",
      "your race, Gossage was the political property, so to speak, of\r\n",
      "generations of your family. Stand therefore in the good old interest\r\n",
      "and you'll stand like a lion.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you mean,\" Captain Yule laughed, \"that I must first\r\n",
      "roar like one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, _I'll_ do the roaring!\"--and Mr. Prodmore shook his\r\n",
      "mane. \"Leave that to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why the deuce don't you stand yourself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore knew so familiarly why! \"Because I'm not a\r\n",
      "remarkably handsome young man with the grand old home and the right\r\n",
      "old name. Because I'm a different sort of matter altogether. But if I\r\n",
      "haven't these advantages,\" he went on, \"you'll do justice to my\r\n",
      "natural desire that my daughter at least shall have them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clement Yule watched himself smoke a minute. \"Doing justice to\r\n",
      "natural desires is just what, of late, I've tried to make a study\r\n",
      "of. But I confess I don't quite grasp the deep attraction you appear\r\n",
      "to discover in so large a surrender of your interests.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My surrenders are my own affair,\" Mr. Prodmore rang out, \"and as\r\n",
      "for my interests, as I never, on principle, give anything for nothing,\r\n",
      "I dare say I may be trusted to know them when I see them. You come\r\n",
      "high--I don't for a moment deny it; but when I look at you, in\r\n",
      "this pleasant, intimate way, my dear boy--if you'll allow me so to\r\n",
      "describe things--I recognise one of those cases, unmistakeable when\r\n",
      "really met, in which one must put down one's money. There's not\r\n",
      "an article in the whole shop, if you don't mind the comparison,\r\n",
      "that strikes me as better value. I intend you shall be, Captain,\"\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore wound up in a frank, bold burst, \"the true comfort of\r\n",
      "my life!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man was as hushed for a little as if an organ-tone were\r\n",
      "still in the air. \"May I inquire,\" he at last returned, \"if Miss\r\n",
      "Prodmore's ideas of comfort are as well defined--and in her case, I\r\n",
      "may add, as touchingly modest--as her father's? Is she a responsible\r\n",
      "party of this ingenious arrangement?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore rendered homage--his appreciation was marked--to the\r\n",
      "elevated character of his young friend's scruple. \"Miss Prodmore,\r\n",
      "Captain Yule, may be perhaps best described as a large smooth sheet\r\n",
      "of blank, though gilt-edged, paper. No image of any tie but the true\r\n",
      "and perfect filial has yet, I can answer for it, formed itself on the\r\n",
      "considerable expanse. But for that image to be projected----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've only, in person, to appear?\" Yule asked with an embarrassment\r\n",
      "that he tried to laugh off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And, naturally, in person,\" Mr. Prodmore intelligently assented,\r\n",
      "\"do yourself, as well as the young lady, justice. Do you remember\r\n",
      "what you said when I first, in London, laid the matter before you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clement Yule did remember, but his amusement increased. \"I think\r\n",
      "I said it struck me I should first take a look at--what do you call\r\n",
      "it?--the _corpus delicti_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You should first see for yourself what you had really come into? I\r\n",

      "should also first see the young lady.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I think you'll find that there's everything.\" Mr. Prodmore\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Yule's alarm, however, was not assuaged; it appeared to grow as he\r\n",
      "stared, much discomposed, yet sharply thinking, at the door to which\r\n",
      "his friend had pointed. \"Oh, longer than _this_, please!\" Then as\r\n",
      "he turned away: \"Do you mean she knows----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That she's here on view?\" Mr. Prodmore hung fire a moment, but\r\n",
      "was equal to the occasion. \"She knows nothing whatever. She's as\r\n",
      "unconscious as the rose on its stem!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion was visibly relieved. \"That's right--let her remain\r\n",
      "so! I'll first take the house,\" said Clement Yule.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The young man's reflection was brief. \"Thank you. I'd rather, on\r\n",
      "the whole, go round alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old servant who had admitted the gentlemen came back at this crisis\r\n",
      "from the morning-room, looking from under a bent brow and with much\r\n",
      "limpid earnestness from one of them to the other. The one he first\r\n",
      "addressed had evidently, though quite unaware of it, inspired him with\r\n",
      "a sympathy from which he now took a hint. \"There's tea on, sir!\"\r\n",
      "he persuasively jerked as he passed the younger man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The elder answered. \"Then I'll join my daughter.\" He gained\r\n",
      "the morning-room door, whence he repeated with an appropriate\r\n",
      "gesture--that of offering proudly, with light, firm fingers, a flower\r\n",
      "of his own celebrated raising--his happy formula of Miss Prodmore's\r\n",
      "state. \"The rose on its stem!\" Scattering petals, diffusing\r\n",
      "fragrance, he thus passed out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers, meanwhile, had rather pointlessly settled once more in its\r\n",
      "place some small object that had not strayed; to whom Clement Yule,\r\n",
      "absently watching him, abruptly broke out. \"I say, my friend, what\r\n",
      "colour is the rose?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man looked up with a dimness that presently glimmered. \"The\r\n",

      "a brilliant----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A brilliant----?\" Yule was interested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Kind of old-fashioned red.\" Chivers smiled with the pride of\r\n",
      "being thus able to testify, but the next instant his smile went\r\n",
      "out. \"It's the only one left--on the old west wall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His visitor's mirth, at this, quickly enough revived. \"My dear\r\n",
      "fellow, I'm not alluding to the sole ornament of the garden, but to\r\n",
      "the young lady at present in the morning-room. Do you happen to have\r\n",
      "noticed if she's pretty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers stood queerly rueful. \"Laws, sir--it's a matter I mostly\r\n",

      "on the stairs, before she had reached the middlemost landing, of the\r\n",
      "wonderful figure of a lady, a lady who, with the almost trumpeted\r\n",
      "cheer of her peremptory but friendly call--\"Housekeeper, Butler, old\r\n",
      "Family Servant!\"--fairly waked the sleeping echoes. Chivers gazed up\r\n",
      "at her in quick remembrance, half dismayed, half dazzled, of a duty\r\n",
      "neglected. She appeared now; she shone at him out of the upper dusk;\r\n",
      "reaching the middle, she had begun to descend, with beautiful laughter\r\n",
      "and rustling garments; and though she was alone she gave him the sense\r\n",

      "relation quite of its own to all social preliminaries. It evidently\r\n",
      "either assumed them to be already over or wished to forestall them\r\n",
      "altogether; what was clear at any rate was that it allowed them scant\r\n",
      "existence. She was young, tall, radiant, lovely, and dressed in a\r\n",
      "manner determined at once, obviously, by the fact and by the humour\r\n",
      "of her journey--it might have proclaimed her so a pilgrim or so set\r\n",
      "her up as a priestess. Most journeys, for this lady, at all events,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just what everyone finds it!\"--she broke into the\r\n",
      "happiest laugh. \"Yet I haven't come here to suffer in silence, you\r\n",

      "movement, from side to side, observing, comparing, returning, taking\r\n",
      "notes while she gossiped and gossiping, too, for remembrance. The\r\n",
      "intention of remembrance even had in it, however, some prevision of\r\n",
      "failure or some alloy of irritation. \"You're so fatally right and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "you were looking for more things than ever _I_ heard tell of!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I had got you by heart,\" she returned, \"from books and\r\n",
      "drawings and photos; I had you in my pocket when I came: so, you see,\r\n",
      "as soon as you were so good as to give me my head and let me loose,\r\n",
      "I knew my way about. It's all here, every inch of it,\" she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A light of consternation, at this, just glimmered in Chivers's\r\n",
      "face. \"And pray, mum, what might that be?\"\r\n",

      "\"Why, take you right back with me--to Missoura Top.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This answer seemed to fix his bewilderment, but he was there for the\r\n",
      "general convenience.\r\n",

      "\"Do I understand you, mum, that you require to take _me_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her particular convenience, on the spot, embraced him, so new and\r\n",
      "delightful a sense had he suddenly read into her words. \"Do you\r\n",
      "mean to say you'd come--as the old Family Servant? Then _do_,\r\n",
      "you nice real thing: it's just what I'm dying for--an old Family\r\n",
      "Servant! You're somebody's else, yes--but everything, over here,\r\n",
      "is somebody's else, and I want, too, a first-rate second-hand one,\r\n",
      "all ready made, as you are, but not too much done up. You're the\r\n",
      "best I've seen yet, and I wish I could have you packed--put up in\r\n",
      "paper and bran--as I shall have my old pot there.\" She whisked about,\r\n",
      "remembering, recovering, eager: \"Don't let me _forget_ my precious\r\n",
      "pot!\" Excited, with quick transitions, she quite sociably appealed\r\n",
      "to her companion, who shuffled sympathetically to where, out of harm,\r\n",
      "the object had been placed on a table. \"Don't you just love old\r\n",
      "crockery? That's awfully sweet old Chelsea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took up the piece with tenderness, though, in his general agitation,\r\n",
      "not perhaps with all the caution with which, for daily service, he\r\n",
      "handled ancient frailties. He at any rate turned on this fresh subject\r\n",
      "an interested, puzzled eye. \"Where is it I've known this very\r\n",
      "bit--though not to say, as _you_ do, by name?\" Suddenly it came to\r\n",
      "him. \"In the pew-opener's front parlour!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" his interlocutress cried, \"in the pew-opener's best\r\n",
      "bedroom: on the old chest of drawers, you know--with those ducks of\r\n",
      "brass handles. I've got the handles too--I mean the whole thing;\r\n",
      "and the brass fender and fire-irons, and the chair her grandmother died\r\n",
      "in. Not in the fly,\" she added--\"it was such a bore that they have\r\n",
      "to be sent.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers, with the pot still in his hands, fairly rocked in the high\r\n",
      "wind of so much confidence and such great transactions. He had nothing\r\n",
      "for these, however, but approval. \"You did right to take this out,\r\n",
      "mum, when the fly went to the stables. Them flymen do be cruel rash\r\n",
      "with anything that's delicate.\" Of the delicacy of the vessel\r\n",
      "it now rested with him to deposit safely again he was by this time\r\n",
      "so appreciatively aware that in returning with it to its safe niche\r\n",
      "he stumbled into some obscure trap literally laid for him by his\r\n",
      "nervousness. It was the matter of a few seconds, of a false movement,\r\n",
      "a knock of the elbow, a gasp, a shriek, a complete little crash. There\r\n",
      "was the pot on the pavement, in several pieces, and the clumsy\r\n",
      "cup-bearer blue with fear. \"Mercy _on_ us, mum,--I've brought shame\r\n",
      "on my old grey hairs!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little shriek of his companion had smothered itself in the\r\n",
      "utterance, and the next minute, with the ruin between them, they\r\n",
      "were contrastedly face to face. The charming woman, who had already\r\n",
      "found more voices in the air than anyone had found before, could, in\r\n",
      "the happy play of this power, find a poetry in her accident. \"Oh,\r\n",
      "but the way you _take_ it!\" she laughed--\"you're too quaint\r\n",
      "to live!\" She looked at him as if he alone had suffered--as if his\r\n",
      "suffering indeed positively added to his charm. \"The way you said\r\n",
      "that now--it's just the very 'type'! That's all I want of\r\n",
      "you now--to _be_ the very type. It's what you are, you poor dear\r\n",
      "thing--for you _can't_ help it; and it's what everything and\r\n",
      "everyone else is, over here; so that you had just better all make\r\n",
      "up your minds to it and not try to shirk it. There was a type in the\r\n",
      "train with me--the 'awfully nice girl' of all the English novels,\r\n",
      "the 'simple maiden in her flower' of--who is it?--your great\r\n",
      "poet. _She_ couldn't help it either--in fact I wouldn't have _let_\r\n",
      "her!\" With this, while Chivers picked up his fragments, his lady had\r\n",
      "a happy recall. His face, as he stood there with the shapeless elements\r\n",
      "of his humiliation fairly rattling again in his hands, was a reflection\r\n",
      "of her extraordinary manner of enlarging the subject, or rather, more\r\n",
      "beneficently perhaps, the space that contained it. \"By the way, the\r\n",
      "girl was coming right here. Has she come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers crept solemnly away, as if to bury his dead, which he\r\n",
      "consigned, with dumb rites, to a situation of honourable publicity;\r\n",
      "then, as he came back, he replied without elation: \"Miss Prodmore is\r\n",
      "here, mum. She's having her tea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This, for his friend, was a confirmatory touch to be fitted with\r\n",
      "eagerness into the picture. \"Yes, that's exactly it--they're\r\n",
      "always having their tea!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With Mr. Prodmore--in the morning-room,\" the old man supplemented.\r\n",
      "\"Captain Yule's in the garden.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Captain Yule?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The new master. He's also just arrived.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wonderful lady gave an immediate \"Oh!\" to the effect of which\r\n",
      "her silence for another moment seemed to add. \"She didn't tell me\r\n",
      "about _him_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, mum,\" said Chivers, \"it do be a strange thing to tell. He\r\n",
      "had never--like, mum--so much as seen the place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Before today--his very own?\" This too, for the visitor, was an\r\n",
      "impression among impressions, and, like most of her others, it ended\r\n",
      "after an instant as a laugh. \"Well, I hope he likes it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I haven't seen many, mum,\" Chivers boldly declared, \"that like\r\n",
      "it as much as _you_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She made with her handsome head a motion that appeared to signify\r\n",
      "still deeper things than he had caught. Her beautiful wondering eyes\r\n",
      "played high and low, like the flight of an imprisoned swallow, then, as\r\n",
      "she sank upon a seat, dropped at last as if the creature were bruised\r\n",
      "with its limits. \"I should like it still better if it were _my_ very\r\n",
      "own!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, mum,\" Chivers sighed, \"if it wasn't against my duty I\r\n",
      "could wish indeed it were! But the Captain, mum,\" he conscientiously\r\n",
      "added, \"is the lawful heir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a wonder what she found in whatever he said; he touched with\r\n",
      "every word the spring of her friendly joy. \"That's another of your\r\n",
      "lovely old things--I adore your lawful heirs!\" She appeared to have,\r\n",
      "about everything that came up, a general lucid vision that almost\r\n",
      "glorified the particular case. \"He has come to take possession?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers accepted, for the credit of the house, this sustaining\r\n",
      "suggestion. \"He's a-taking of it now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This evoked, for his companion, an instantaneous show. \"What\r\n",
      "does he do and how does he do it? Can't I _see_?\" She was all\r\n",
      "impatience, but she dropped to disappointment as her guide looked\r\n",
      "blank. \"There's no grand fuss----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I scarce think him, mum,\" Chivers with propriety hastened to\r\n",
      "respond, \"the gentleman to make any about anything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had to resign herself, but she smiled as she thought. \"Well,\r\n",
      "perhaps I like them better when they don't!\" She had clearly a\r\n",
      "great range of taste, and it all came out in the wistfulness with\r\n",
      "which, before the notice apparently served on her, she prepared\r\n",
      "to make way. \"I also\"--she lingered and sighed--\"have taken\r\n",
      "possession!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Chivers really rose to her. \"It was you, mum,\" he smiled,\r\n",
      "\"took it first!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sadly shook her head. \"Ah, but for a poor little hour! _He's_\r\n",
      "for life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man gave up, after a little, with equal depression, the\r\n",
      "pretence of dealing with such realities. \"For mine, mum, I do at\r\n",
      "least hope.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She made again the circuit of the great place, picking up without\r\n",
      "interest the jacket she had on her previous entrance laid down. \"I\r\n",
      "shall think of you, you know, here together.\" She vaguely looked\r\n",
      "about her as for anything else to take; then abruptly, with her eyes\r\n",
      "again on Chivers: \"Do you suppose he'll be kind to you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His hand, in his trousers-pocket, seemed to turn the matter over. \"He\r\n",
      "has already been, mum.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then be sure to be so to _him_!\" she replied with some\r\n",
      "emphasis. The house-bell sounded as she spoke, giving her quickly\r\n",
      "another thought. \"Is that his bell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers was hardly less struck. \"I must see whose!\"--and hurrying,\r\n",
      "on this, to the front, he presently again vanished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His companion, left alone, stood a minute with an air in which happy\r\n",
      "possession was oddly and charmingly mingled with desperate surrender;\r\n",
      "so much as to have left you in doubt if the next of her lively motions\r\n",
      "were curiosity or disgust. Impressed, in her divided state, with a\r\n",
      "small framed plaque of enamel, she impulsively detached it from the\r\n",
      "wall and examined it with hungry tenderness. Her hovering thought was\r\n",
      "so vivid that you might almost have traced it in sound. \"Why, bless\r\n",
      "me if it isn't Limoges! I wish awfully I were a _bad_ woman: then,\r\n",
      "I do devoutly hope, I'd just quietly take it!\" It testified to the\r\n",
      "force of this temptation that on hearing a sound behind her she started\r\n",
      "like a guilty thing; recovering herself, however, and--just, of course,\r\n",
      "not to appear at fault--keeping the object familiarly in her hand as\r\n",
      "she jumped to a recognition of the gentleman who, coming in from the\r\n",
      "garden, had stopped in the open doorway. She gathered indeed from his\r\n",
      "being there a positive advantage, the full confidence of which was\r\n",
      "already in her charming tone. \"Oh, Captain Yule, I'm delighted to\r\n",
      "meet you! It's such a comfort to ask you if I _may_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His surprise kept him an instant dumb, but the effort not too\r\n",
      "closely to betray it appeared in his persuasive inflection. \"If you\r\n",
      "'may,' madam----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, just _be_ here, don't you know? and poke round!\" She\r\n",
      "presented such a course as almost vulgarly natural. \"Don't tell\r\n",
      "me I can't now, because I already _have_: I've been upstairs\r\n",
      "and downstairs and in my lady's chamber--I won't answer for\r\n",
      "it even perhaps that I've not been in my lord's! I got round\r\n",
      "your lovely servant--if you don't look out I'll grab him. If\r\n",
      "you don't look out, you know, I'll grab everything.\" She\r\n",
      "gave fair notice and went on with amazing serenity; she gathered\r\n",
      "positive gaiety from his frank stupefaction. \"That's what I came\r\n",
      "over for--just to lay your country waste. Your house is a wild old\r\n",
      "dream; and besides\"--she dropped, oddly and quaintly, into real\r\n",
      "responsible judgment--\"you've got some quite good things. Oh,\r\n",
      "yes, you _have_--several: don't coyly pretend you haven't!\" Her\r\n",
      "familiarity took these flying leaps, and she alighted, as her victim\r\n",
      "must have phrased it to himself, without turning a hair. \"Don't\r\n",
      "you _know_ you have? Just look at that!\" She thrust her enamel\r\n",
      "before him, but he took it and held it so blankly, with an attention\r\n",
      "so absorbed in the mere woman, that at the sight of his manner her\r\n",
      "zeal for his interest and her pity for his detachment again flashed\r\n",
      "out. \"Don't you know _anything_? Why, it's Limoges!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clement Yule simply broke into a laugh--though his laugh indeed\r\n",
      "was comprehensive. \"It seems absurd, but I'm not in the least\r\n",
      "acquainted with my house. I've never happened to see it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She seized his arm. \"Then do let me show it to you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall be delighted.\" His laughter had redoubled in a way that\r\n",
      "spoke of his previous tension; yet his tone, as he saw Chivers return\r\n",
      "breathless from the front, showed that he had responded sincerely\r\n",
      "enough to desire a clear field. \"Who in the world's there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man was full of it. \"A party!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A party?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers confessed to the worst. \"Over from Gossage--to see the\r\n",
      "house.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The worst, however, clearly, was quite good enough for their\r\n",
      "companion, who embraced the incident with sudden enthusiasm. \"Oh,\r\n",
      "let _me_ show it!\" But before either of the men could reply she had,\r\n",
      "addressing herself to Chivers, one of those droll drops that betrayed\r\n",
      "the quickness of her wit and the freedom of her fancy. \"Dear me, I\r\n",
      "forgot--_you_ get the tips! But, you dear old creature,\" she went on,\r\n",
      "\"I'll get them, too, and I'll simply make them over to you.\"\r\n",
      "She again pressed Yule--pressed him into this service. \"Perhaps\r\n",
      "they'll be bigger--for me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He continued to be highly amused. \"I should think they'd\r\n",
      "be enormous--for you! But I _should_ like,\" he added with more\r\n",
      "concentration--\"I should like extremely, you know, to go over with\r\n",
      "you alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was held a moment. \"Just you and me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just you and me--as you kindly proposed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stood reminded; but, throwing it off, she had her first\r\n",
      "inconsequence. \"That must be for after----!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, but not too late.\" He looked at his watch. \"I go back\r\n",
      "tonight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Laws, sir!\" Chivers irrepressibly groaned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You want to keep him?\" the stranger asked. Captain Yule turned\r\n",
      "away at the question, but her look went after him, and she found\r\n",
      "herself, somehow, instantly answered. \"Then I'll help you,\" she\r\n",
      "said to Chivers; \"and the oftener we go over the better.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something further, on this, quite immaterial, but quite adequate,\r\n",
      "passed, while the young man's back was turned, between the two\r\n",
      "others; in consequence of which Chivers again appealed to his\r\n",
      "master. \"Shall I show them straight in, sir?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His master, still detached, replied without looking at him. \"By all\r\n",
      "means--if there's money in it!\" This was jocose, but there would\r\n",
      "have been, for an observer, an increase of hope in the old man's\r\n",
      "departing step. The lady had exerted an influence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She continued, for that matter, with a start of genial remembrance,\r\n",
      "to exert one in his absence. \"Oh, and I promised to show it to Miss\r\n",
      "Prodmore!\" Her conscience, with a kind smile for the young person she\r\n",
      "named, put the question to Clement Yule. \"Won't you call her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The coldness of his quick response made it practically none.\r\n",
      "\"'Call' her? Dear lady, I don't _know_ her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must, then--she's wonderful.\" The face with which he met\r\n",
      "this drew from the dear lady a sharper look; but, for the aid of her\r\n",
      "good-nature, Cora Prodmore, at the moment she spoke, presented herself\r\n",
      "in the doorway of the morning-room. \"See? She's charming!\" The\r\n",
      "girl, with a glare of recognition, dashed across the open as if under\r\n",
      "heavy fire; but heavy fire, alas--the extremity of exposure--was\r\n",
      "promptly embodied in her friend's public embrace. \"Miss\r\n",
      "Prodmore,\" said this terrible friend, \"let me present Captain\r\n",
      "Yule.\" Never had so great a gulf been bridged in so free a\r\n",
      "span. \"Captain Yule, Miss Prodmore. Miss Prodmore, Captain Yule.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was stiffness, the cold mask of terror, in such notice as either\r\n",
      "party took of this demonstration, the convenience of which was not\r\n",
      "enhanced for the divided pair by the perception that Mr. Prodmore\r\n",
      "had now followed his daughter. Cora threw herself confusedly\r\n",
      "into it indeed, as with a vain rebound into the open. \"Papa,\r\n",
      "let me 'present' you to Mrs. Gracedew. Mrs. Gracedew, Mr.\r\n",
      "Prodmore. Mr. Prodmore, Mrs. Gracedew.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, with a free salute and a distinct repetition, took in\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore as she had taken everything else. \"Mr. Prodmore\"--oh,\r\n",
      "she pronounced him, spared him nothing of himself. \"So happy to meet\r\n",
      "your daughter's father. Your daughter's so perfect a specimen.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, for the first moment, had simply looked large and at\r\n",
      "sea; then, like a practical man and without more question, had quickly\r\n",
      "seized the long perch held out to him in this statement. \"So perfect\r\n",
      "a specimen, yes!\"--he seemed to pass it on to his young friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, if she observed his emphasis, drew from it no\r\n",
      "deterrence; she only continued to cover Cora with a gaze that kept her\r\n",
      "well in the middle. \"So fresh, so quaint, so droll!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was apparently a result of what had passed in the morning-room that\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore had grasped afresh the need for effective action, which\r\n",
      "he clearly felt he did something to meet in clutching precipitately the\r\n",
      "helping hand popped so suddenly out of space, yet so beautifully gloved\r\n",
      "and so pressingly and gracefully brandished. \"So fresh, so quaint, so\r\n",
      "droll!\"--he again gave Captain Yule the advantage of the stranger's\r\n",
      "impression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To what further appreciation this might have prompted the lady herself\r\n",
      "was not, however, just then manifest; for the return of Chivers had\r\n",
      "been almost simultaneous with the advance of the Prodmores, and it had\r\n",
      "taken place with forms that made it something of a circumstance. There\r\n",
      "was positive pomp in the way he preceded several persons of both sexes,\r\n",
      "not tourists at large, but simple sightseers of the half-holiday order,\r\n",
      "plain provincial folk already, on the spot, rather awestruck. The old\r\n",
      "man, with suppressed pulls and prayers, had drawn them up in a broken\r\n",
      "line, and the habit of more peopled years, the dull drone of the dead\r\n",
      "lesson, sounded out in his prompt beginning. The party stood close,\r\n",
      "in this manner, on one side of the apartment, while the master of the\r\n",
      "house and his little circle were grouped on the other. But as Chivers,\r\n",
      "guiding his squad, reached the centre of the space, Mrs. Gracedew,\r\n",
      "markedly moved, quite unreservedly engaged, came slowly forward to\r\n",
      "meet him. \"This, ladies and gentlemen,\" he mechanically quavered,\r\n",
      "\"is perhaps the most important feature--the grand old feudal,\r\n",
      "baronial 'all. Being, from all accounts, the most ancient portion of\r\n",
      "the edifice, it was erected in the very earliest ages.\" He paused a\r\n",
      "moment, to mark his effect, then gave a little cough which had become,\r\n",
      "obviously, in these great reaches of time, an essential part of the\r\n",
      "trick. \"Some do say,\" he dispassionately remarked, \"in the course\r\n",
      "of the fifteenth century.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, who had visibly thrown herself into the working of the\r\n",
      "charm, following him with vivid sympathy and hanging on his lips, took\r\n",
      "the liberty, at this, of quite affectionately pouncing on him. \"_I_\r\n",
      "say in the fourteenth, my dear--you're robbing us of a hundred\r\n",
      "years!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her victim yielded without a struggle. \"I do seem, in them dark\r\n",
      "old centuries, sometimes to trip a little.\" Yet the interruption of\r\n",
      "his ancient order distinctly discomposed him, all the more that his\r\n",
      "audience, gaping with a sense of the importance of the fine point,\r\n",
      "moved in its mass a little nearer. Thus put upon his honour, he\r\n",
      "endeavoured to address the group with a dignity undiminished. \"The\r\n",
      "Gothic roof is much admired, but the west gallery is a modern\r\n",
      "addition.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His discriminations had the note of culture, but his candour, all too\r\n",
      "promptly, struck Mrs. Gracedew as excessive. \"What in the name of\r\n",
      "Methuselah do you call 'modern'? It was here at the visit of James\r\n",
      "the First, in 1611, and is supposed to have served, in the charming\r\n",
      "detail of its ornament, as a model for several that were constructed\r\n",
      "in his reign. The great fireplace,\" she handsomely conceded, \"_is_\r\n",
      "Jacobean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had taken him up with such wondrous benignant authority--as if,\r\n",
      "for her life, if they _were_ to have it, she couldn't help taking\r\n",
      "care that they had it out; she had interposed with an assurance that\r\n",
      "so converted her--as by the wave of a great wand, the motion of one of\r\n",
      "her own free arms--from mere passive alien to domesticated dragon, that\r\n",
      "poor Chivers could only assent with grateful obeisances. She so plunged\r\n",
      "into the old book that he had quite lost his place. The two gentlemen\r\n",
      "and the young lady, moreover, were held there by the magic of her\r\n",
      "manner. His own, as he turned again to his cluster of sightseers, took\r\n",
      "refuge in its last refinement. \"The tapestry on the left Italian--the\r\n",
      "elegant wood-work Flemish.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew was upon him again. \"Excuse me if I just deprecate a\r\n",
      "misconception. The elegant wood-work Italian--the tapestry on the left\r\n",
      "Flemish.\" Suddenly she put it to him before them all, pleading as\r\n",
      "familiarly and gaily as she had done when alone with him, and looking\r\n",
      "now at the others, all round, gentry and poor folk alike, for sympathy\r\n",
      "and support. She had an idea that made her dance. \"Do you really\r\n",
      "mind if _I_ just do it? Oh, I know how: I can do quite beautifully\r\n",
      "the housekeeper last week at Castle Gaunt.\" She fraternised with\r\n",
      "the company as if it were a game they must play with her, though\r\n",
      "this first stage sufficiently hushed them. \"How do you do? Ain't\r\n",
      "it thrilling?\" Then with a laugh as free as if, for a disguise,\r\n",
      "she had thrown her handkerchief over her head or made an apron of her\r\n",
      "tucked-up skirt, she passed to the grand manner. \"Keep well together,\r\n",
      "please--we're not doing puss-in-the-corner. I've my duty to all\r\n",
      "parties--I can't be partial to one!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The contingent from Gossage had, after all, like most contingents, its\r\n",
      "spokesman--a very erect little personage in a very new suit and a very\r\n",
      "green necktie, with a very long face and upstanding hair. It was on\r\n",
      "an evident sense of having been practically selected for encouragement\r\n",
      "that he, in turn, made choice of a question which drew all eyes. \"How\r\n",
      "many parties, now, can you manage?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew was superbly definite. \"Two. The party up and the\r\n",
      "party down.\" Chivers gasped at the way she dealt with this liberty,\r\n",
      "and his impression was conspicuously deepened as she pointed to\r\n",
      "one of the escutcheons in the high hall-window. \"Observe in the\r\n",
      "centre compartment the family arms.\" She did take his breath\r\n",
      "away, for before he knew it she had crossed with the lightest but\r\n",
      "surest of gestures to the black old portrait, on the opposite wall,\r\n",
      "of a long-limbed gentleman in white trunk-hose. \"And observe the\r\n",
      "family legs!\" Her method was wholly her own, irregular and broad;\r\n",
      "she flew, familiarly, from the pavement to the roof and then dropped\r\n",
      "from the roof to the pavement as if the whole air of the place were an\r\n",
      "element in which she floated. \"Observe the suit of armour worn at\r\n",
      "Tewkesbury--observe the tattered banner carried at Blenheim.\" They\r\n",
      "bobbed their heads wherever she pointed, but it would have come home\r\n",
      "to any spectator that they saw her alone. This was the case quite as\r\n",
      "much with the opposite trio--the case especially with Clement Yule,\r\n",
      "who indeed made no pretence of keeping up with her signs. It was the\r\n",
      "signs themselves he looked at--not at the subjects indicated. But he\r\n",
      "never took his eyes from her, and it was as if, at last, she had been\r\n",
      "peculiarly affected by a glimpse of his attention. All her own, for\r\n",
      "a moment, frankly went back to him and was immediately determined by\r\n",
      "it. \"Observe, above all, that you're in one of the most interesting\r\n",
      "old houses, of its type, in England; for which the ages have been\r\n",
      "tender and the generations wise: letting it change so slowly that\r\n",
      "there's always more left than taken--living their lives in it, but\r\n",
      "letting it shape their lives!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though this pretty speech had been unmistakeably addressed to the\r\n",
      "younger of the temporary occupants of Covering End, it was the elder\r\n",
      "who, on the spot, took it up. \"A most striking and appropriate\r\n",
      "tribute to a real historical monument!\" Mr. Prodmore had a natural\r\n",
      "ease that could deal handsomely with compliments, and he manifestly,\r\n",
      "moreover, like a clever man, saw even more in such an explosion of them\r\n",
      "than fully met the ear. \"You do, madam, bring the whole thing out!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitor who had already with such impunity ventured had, on\r\n",
      "this, a loud renewal of boldness, but for the benefit of a near\r\n",
      "neighbour. \"Doesn't she indeed, Jane, bring it out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, with a friendly laugh, caught the words in their\r\n",
      "passage. \"But who in the world wants to keep it _in_? It isn't\r\n",
      "a secret--it isn't a strange cat or a political party!\" The\r\n",
      "housekeeper, as she talked, had already dropped from her; her sense of\r\n",
      "the place was too fresh for control, though instead of half an hour\r\n",
      "it might have taken six months to become so fond. She soared again,\r\n",
      "at random, to the noble spring of the roof. \"Just look at those\r\n",
      "lovely lines!\" They all looked, all but Clement Yule, and several\r\n",
      "of the larger company, subdued, overwhelmed, nudged each other with\r\n",
      "strange sounds. Wherever she turned Mrs. Gracedew appeared to find a\r\n",
      "pretext for breaking out. \"Just look at the tone of that glass, and\r\n",
      "the gilding of that leather, and the cutting of that oak, and the dear\r\n",
      "old flags of the very floor.\" It came back, came back easily, her\r\n",
      "impulse to appeal to the lawful heir, and she seemed, with her smile\r\n",
      "of universal intelligence, just to demand the charity of another moment\r\n",
      "for it. \"To look, in this place, is to love!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A voice from the party she had in hand took it up with an artless\r\n",
      "guffaw that resounded more than had doubtless been meant and that, at\r\n",
      "any rate, was evidently the accompaniment of some private pinch applied\r\n",
      "to one of the ladies. \"I _say_--to love!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was one of the ladies who very properly replied. \"It depends on\r\n",
      "who you look at!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, in the geniality of the hour, made his profit of the\r\n",
      "simple joke. \"Do you hear _that_, Captain? You must look at the right\r\n",
      "person!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew certainly had not been looking at the wrong one. \"I\r\n",
      "don't think Captain Yule cares. He doesn't do justice----!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though her face was still gay, she had faltered, which seemed to strike\r\n",
      "the young man even more than if she had gone on. \"To what, madam?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, on the chance she let him have it. \"To the value of your\r\n",
      "house.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took it beautifully. \"I like to hear _you_ express it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I _can't_ express it!\" She once more looked all round, and so\r\n",
      "much more gravely than she had yet done that she might have appeared\r\n",
      "in trouble. She tried but, with a sigh, broke down. \"It's too\r\n",
      "inexpressible!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a view of the case to which Mr. Prodmore, for his own reasons,\r\n",
      "was not prepared to assent. Expression and formulation were what he\r\n",
      "naturally most desired, and he had just encountered a fountain of these\r\n",
      "things that he couldn't prematurely suffer to fail him. \"Do what\r\n",
      "you can for it, madam. It would bring it quite home.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus excited, she gave with sudden sombre clearness another\r\n",
      "try. \"Well--the value's a fancy value!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, receiving it as more than he could have hoped, turned\r\n",
      "triumphant to his young friend. \"Exactly what I told you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew explained indeed as if Mr. Prodmore's triumph was\r\n",
      "not perhaps exactly what she had argued for. Still, the truth was too\r\n",
      "great. \"When a thing's unique, it's unique!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was every bit Mr. Prodmore required. \"It's unique!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This met, moreover, the perception of the gentleman in the\r\n",
      "green necktie. \"It's unique!\" They all, in fact, demonstratively--almost\r\n",
      "vociferously now--caught the point.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, finding herself so sustained, and still with her eyes\r\n",
      "on the lawful heirs, put it yet more strongly. \"It's worth anything\r\n",
      "you like.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was this but precisely what Mr. Prodmore had always striven to\r\n",
      "prove? \"Anything you like!\" he richly reverberated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pleasant discussion and the general interest seemed to bring them\r\n",
      "all together. \"Twenty thousand now?\" one of the gentlemen from\r\n",
      "Gossage archly inquired--a very young gentleman with an almost coaxing\r\n",
      "voice, who blushed immensely as soon as he had spoken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He blushed still more at the way Mrs. Gracedew faced him. \"I\r\n",
      "wouldn't _look_ at twenty thousand!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, on the other hand, was proportionately uplifted. \"She\r\n",
      "wouldn't look at twenty thousand!\" he announced with intensity to\r\n",
      "the Captain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitor who had been the first to speak gave a shrewder\r\n",
      "guess. \"Thirty, then, as it stands?\"\r\n",

      "time to avert an awkwardness. \"How do you come to know so much about\r\n",
      "my house?\"\r\n",

      "quicken her interest. He was plainly as good in his way as the old\r\n",

      "lifelong service. Her interest, none the less, in its turn, could only\r\n",
      "quicken her pity, and all her emotions, we have already seen, found\r\n",
      "prompt enough expression. What could any expression do indeed now but\r\n",
      "mark the romantic reality? \"Why, you poor thing!\"--she came toward\r\n",
      "him on the weary road. \"Now that you've got here I hope at least\r\n",
      "you'll stay.\" Their intercourse must pitch itself--so far as she\r\n",

      "extraordinary. \"Are you sure we always know them apart?\"\r\n",

      "\"Not quite every time!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "only, after an instant, to recognise a difficulty. \"When you look\r\n",
      "at _me_, you're all right!\" she sighed. It was an obstacle to her\r\n",
      "lesson, and she cast her eyes about. \"Look at that chimneypiece.\"\r\n",

      "\"Well----?\" he inquired as his eyes came back from it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "He returned to it without passion--gave a vivid sign of mere\r\n",
      "disability. \"I'm sure I don't know. I don't mean to say\r\n",
      "anything. I'm a rank outsider.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Up to what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Up to everything!\"--his levity added to her earnestness. \"You\r\n",

      "about. \"Where's your cigarette?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "rules!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How could such a house have any others?\"--she was already\r\n",
      "launched again in her brave relation to it. \"I _may_ go up just once\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "How could he tell? \"The long gallery?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With an added glow she remembered. \"I forgot you've never seen\r\n",
      "it. Why, it's the leading thing about you!\" She was full, on the\r\n",
      "spot, of the pride of showing it. \"Come right up!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clement Yule, half seated on a table from which his long left leg\r\n",
      "nervously swung, only looked at her and smiled and smoked. \"There's\r\n",
      "a party up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She remembered afresh. \"So _we_ must be the party down? Well, you\r\n",

      "over for.\"\r\n",

      "once. \"Everything!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not? It's a growing place--forty thousand the last census.\"\r\n",

      "\"My husband left it to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man presently changed his posture. \"You're a widow?\"\r\n",

      "Nothing was wanting to the simplicity of her quiet assent. \"A\r\n",
      "very lone woman.\" Her face, for a moment, had the vision of a long\r\n",
      "distance. \"My loneliness is great enough to want something big to\r\n",

      "apprehension in his fine amused and troubled face of how much\r\n",
      "there was of it, her frank, gay concern for him sprang again to the\r\n",

      "from?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She had followed perfectly, he saw the next instant, but she had by no\r\n",

      "He literally, for a moment, in the light of her beauty and familiarity,\r\n",
      "appeared to measure his possible use there; then, looking round him\r\n",
      "again, announced with a sigh that, predicament for predicament, his own\r\n",
      "would do. \"I fear my work is nearer home. I hope,\" he continued,\r\n",
      "\"since you're so good as to seem to care, to perform a part of that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, for all this last time. And before that, from my childhood up,\r\n",
      "there was another reason.\" He took a few steps away and brought it\r\n",
      "out as rather a shabby one. \"A family feud.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She proved to be quite delighted with it. \"Oh, I'm so glad--I\r\n",
      "_hoped_ I'd strike a 'feud'! That rounds it off, and spices it\r\n",
      "up, and, for the heartbreak with which I take leave of you, just neatly\r\n",
      "completes the fracture!\" Her reference to her going seemed suddenly,\r\n",
      "on this, to bring her back to a sense of proportion and propriety, and\r\n",
      "she glanced about once more for some wrap or reticule. This, in turn,\r\n",
      "however, was another recall. \"Must I really wait--to go up?\"\r\n",

      "precious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you literally need I should _say_ it? Can you stand here and not feel\r\n",
      "it?\" If he had the misfortune of bandaged eyes, she could at least\r\n",
      "rejoice in her own vision, which grew intenser with her having to speak\r\n",
      "for it. She spoke as with a new rush of her impression. \"It's a\r\n",

      "\"To love----?\" he impatiently insisted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, as you'd love a person!\" If that was saying the whole\r\n",
      "thing, saying the whole thing could only be to go. A sound from the\r\n",
      "\"party up\" came down at that moment, and she took it so clearly\r\n",
      "as a call that, for a sign of separation, she passed straight to the\r\n",

      "_could_ give it up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her stare, at this, fairly filled the space. \"Give up Covering? How\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Because I can't afford to keep it.\"\r\n",

      "a minute!\"\r\n",

      "Clement Yule remained grave. \"I shouldn't have the face to charge\r\n",
      "you a rent that would make it worth one's while, and I think\r\n",
      "even you, dear lady\"--his voice just trembled as he risked that\r\n",
      "address--\"wouldn't have the face to offer me one.\" He paused,\r\n",
      "but something in his aspect and manner checked in her now any impulse\r\n",
      "to read his meaning too soon. \"My lovely inheritance is Dead Sea\r\n",
      "fruit. It's mortgaged for all it's worth and I haven't the\r\n",
      "means to pay the interest. If by a miracle I could scrape the money\r\n",
      "together, it would leave me without a penny to live on.\" He puffed\r\n",
      "his cigarette profusely. \"So if I find the old home at last--I lose\r\n",
      "it by the same luck!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew had hung upon his words, and she seemed still to wait,\r\n",

      "she had to take them for his last, \"I never heard of anything\r\n",
      "so awful!\" she broke out. \"Do you mean to say you can't\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Something, at this, in his tone, his face--it might have been his\r\n",
      "\"British\" density--seemed to pull her up. \"I forgot--you don't\r\n",

      "simplified. \"My attitude.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I'm not a statue; but on the other hand, don't you\r\n",

      "his rigour. \"The mortgages I speak of have all found their way, like\r\n",
      "gregarious silly sheep, into the hands of one person--a devouring wolf,\r\n",
      "a very rich, a very sharp man of money. He holds me in this manner\r\n",
      "at his mercy. He consents to make things comfortable for me, but he\r\n",

      "whole set----!\" She looked about the hall for something of equivalent\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I'd sacrifice mine,\" she cried, \"for that old fire-back with\r\n",

      "stood!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See how _I've_ stood!\" he answered with spirit. \"I've glowed\r\n",
      "with a hotter fire than anything in any chimney, and the warmth and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "His companion, freshly struck with the fine details of the desolation,\r\n",

      "in the light of her eye that he had applied to her the word in the\r\n",
      "language she least liked, he hastened to attenuate. \"I mean of\r\n",
      "what's behind my reserves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was silent in a way that made their talk more of a discussion than\r\n",
      "if she had spoken. \"What _is_ behind them?\" she presently asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, my whole political history. Everything I've said, everything\r\n",
      "I've done. My scorching addresses and letters, reproduced in all\r\n",
      "the papers. I needn't go into details, but I'm a pure, passionate,\r\n",
      "pledged Radical.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "pomp of the opposite camp. There's a want of transition. It may be\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "If she was not yet prepared to contest she was still less prepared to\r\n",
      "surrender it, and she confined herself for the instant to smoothing\r\n",
      "down with her foot the corner of an old rug. \"Have you thought very\r\n",
      "much about it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "absolutely infantile.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're the cleverest Tory I've ever met!\" he laughed. \"I\r\n",
      "didn't mean to mention my friend's name, but since _you've_ done\r\n",
      "so----!\" He gave up with a shrug his scruple.\r\n",

      "The very lucidity of her interest just checked his assent. \"He holds\r\n",
      "plenty of others, and he treats me very handsomely.\"\r\n",

      "handsome--such a condition?\"\r\n",

      "meet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She measured her inconsistency, but was not abashed. \"We're\r\n",
      "not talking of what _I_ can meet.\" Yet she found also a relief in\r\n",
      "dropping the point. \"Why doesn't he stand himself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, like other devouring wolves, he's not personally adored.\"\r\n",

      "The young man, obviously pleased to find her after all more at\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She listened to him with a sentiment in her face that showed how now,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "as well as strenuous, all her fairness thrown out by her dark old\r\n",

      "The very manner of his speaking on such occasions appeared, for that\r\n",
      "matter, now to come back to him. \"One's 'human home' is all\r\n",

      "something else in the world than the beauty of old show-houses and the\r\n",
      "glory of old show-families. There are thousands of people in England\r\n",

      "stopped; but if that gave him a sense of success, he might have been\r\n",
      "checked by the way she at last turned round with a sad and beautiful\r\n",
      "headshake. \"We share the poor fate of humanity whatever we do, and\r\n",

      "to soothe them, and if there be draughts--there _must_ be!--you're\r\n",
      "here to stop them up. And do you know what _I'm_ here for? If I've\r\n",
      "come so far and so straight, I've almost wondered myself. I've felt\r\n",
      "with a kind of passion--but now I see _why_ I've felt.\" She moved\r\n",
      "about the hall with the excitement of this perception, and, separated\r\n",
      "from him at last by a distance across which he followed her discovery\r\n",
      "with a visible suspense, she brought out the news. \"I'm here for an\r\n",
      "act of salvation--I'm here to avert a sacrifice!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they stood a little, with more, for the minute, passing between them\r\n",
      "than either really could say. She might have flung down a glove that\r\n",
      "he decided on the whole, passing his hand over his head as the seat of\r\n",
      "some confusion, not to pick up. Again, but flushed as well as smiling,\r\n",
      "he sought the easiest cover. \"You're here, I think, madam, to be a\r\n",
      "memory for all my future!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, she was willing, she showed as she came nearer, to take it,\r\n",
      "at the worst, for that. \"You'll be one for mine, if I can see\r\n",
      "you by that hearth. Why do you make such a fuss about changing your\r\n",
      "politics? If you'd come to Missoura Top, you'd change them quick\r\n",
      "enough!\" Then, as she saw further and struck harder, her eyes grew\r\n",
      "deep, her face even seemed to pale, and she paused, splendid and\r\n",
      "serious, with the force of her plea. \"What do politics amount to,\r\n",
      "compared with religions? Parties and programmes come and go, but a\r\n",
      "duty like this abides. There's nothing you can break with\"--she\r\n",
      "pressed him closer, ringing out--\"that would be like breaking\r\n",
      "_here_. The very words are violent and ugly--as much a sacrilege as\r\n",
      "if you had been trusted with the key of the temple. This _is_ the\r\n",
      "temple--don't profane it! Keep up the old altar kindly--you can't\r\n",
      "set up a new one as good. You _must_ have beauty in your life, don't\r\n",
      "you see?--that's the only way to make sure of it for the lives of\r\n",
      "others. Keep leaving it to _them_, to all the poor others,\" she\r\n",
      "went on with her bright irony, \"and heaven only knows what will\r\n",
      "become of it! Does it take one of _us_ to feel that?--to preach you\r\n",
      "the truth? Then it's good, Captain Yule, we come right over--just to\r\n",
      "see, you know, what you may happen to be about. We know,\" she went on\r\n",
      "while her sense of proportion seemed to play into her sense of humour,\r\n",
      "\"what we haven't got, worse luck; so that if you've happily got\r\n",
      "it you've got it also for _us_. You've got it in trust, you see,\r\n",
      "and oh! we have an eye on you. You've had it so for me, all these\r\n",
      "dear days that I've been drinking it in, that, to be grateful, I've\r\n",
      "wanted regularly to _do_ something.\" With which, as if in the rich\r\n",
      "confidence of having convinced him, she came so near as almost to touch\r\n",
      "him. \"Tell me now I shall have done it--I shall have kept you at your\r\n",
      "post!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If he moved, on this, immediately further, it was with the oddest air\r\n",
      "of seeking rather to study her remarks at his ease than to express an\r\n",
      "independence of them. He kept, to this end, his face averted--he was\r\n",
      "so completely now in intelligent possession of her own. The sacrifice\r\n",
      "in question carried him even to the door of the court, where he once\r\n",
      "more stood so long engaged that the persistent presentation of his back\r\n",
      "might at last have suggested either a confession or a request.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, meanwhile, a little spent with her sincerity, seated\r\n",
      "herself again in the great chair, and if she sought, visibly enough,\r\n",
      "to read a meaning into his movement, she had as little triumph for\r\n",
      "one possible view of it as she had resentment for the other. The\r\n",
      "possibility that he yielded left her after all as vague in respect to\r\n",
      "a next step as the possibility that he merely wished to get rid of\r\n",
      "her. The moments elapsed without her abdicating; and indeed when he\r\n",
      "finally turned round his expression was an equal check to any power to\r\n",
      "feel she might have won. \"You have,\" he queerly smiled at her, \"a\r\n",
      "standpoint quite your own and a style of eloquence that the few scraps\r\n",
      "of parliamentary training I've picked up don't seem at all to fit\r\n",
      "me to deal with. Of course I don't pretend, you know, that I don't\r\n",
      "_care_ for Covering.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That, at all events, she could be glad to hear, if only perhaps for the\r\n",
      "tone in it that was so almost comically ingenuous. But her relief was\r\n",
      "reasonable and her exultation temperate. \"You haven't even seen it\r\n",
      "yet.\" She risked, however, a laugh. \"Aren't you a bit afraid?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took a minute to reply, then replied--as if to make it up--with a\r\n",
      "grand collapse. \"Yes; awfully. But if I am,\" he hastened in decency\r\n",
      "to add, \"it isn't only Covering that makes me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This left his friend apparently at a loss. \"What else is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everything. But it doesn't in the least matter,\" he loosely\r\n",
      "pursued. \"You may be quite correct. When we talk of the house your\r\n",
      "voice comes to me somehow as the wind in its old chimneys.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her amusement distinctly revived. \"I hope you don't mean I roar!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He blushed again; there was no doubt he was confused. \"No--nor yet\r\n",
      "perhaps that you whistle! I don't believe the wind does either,\r\n",
      "here. It only whispers,\" he sought gracefully to explain; \"and it\r\n",
      "sighs----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I hope,\" she broke in, \"that it sometimes laughs!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sound she gave only made him, as he looked at her, more\r\n",
      "serious. \"Whatever it does, it's all right.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right?\"--they were sufficiently together again for her to lay\r\n",
      "her hand straight on his arm. \"Then you promise?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Promise what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had turned as pale as if she hurt him, and she took her hand\r\n",
      "away. \"To meet Mr. Prodmore.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, no; not yet!\"--he quite recovered himself. \"I must\r\n",
      "wait--I must think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked disappointed, and there was a momentary silence. \"When\r\n",
      "have you to answer him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, he gives me time!\" Clement Yule spoke very much as he might\r\n",
      "have said, \"Oh, in two minutes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_I_ wouldn't give you time,\" Mrs. Gracedew cried with force--\"I'd\r\n",
      "give you a shaking! For God's sake, at any rate\"--and she\r\n",
      "really tried to push him off--\"go upstairs!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And literally _find_ the dreadful man?\" This was so little his\r\n",
      "personal idea that, distinctly dodging her pressure, he had already\r\n",
      "reached the safe quarter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it befell that at the same moment she saw Cora reappear on\r\n",
      "the upper landing--a circumstance that promised her a still better\r\n",
      "conclusion. \"He's coming down!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora, in spite of this announcement, came down boldly enough without\r\n",
      "him and made directly for Mrs. Gracedew, to whom her eyes had attached\r\n",
      "themselves with an undeviating glare. Her plain purpose of treating\r\n",
      "this lady as an isolated presence allowed their companion perfect\r\n",
      "freedom to consider her arrival with sharp alarm. His disconcerted\r\n",
      "stare seemed for a moment to balance; it wandered, gave a wild glance\r\n",
      "at the open door, then searched the ascent of the staircase, in which,\r\n",
      "apparently, it now found a coercion. \"I'll go up!\" he gasped; and\r\n",
      "he took three steps at a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "V\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl threw herself, in her flushed eagerness, straight upon the\r\n",
      "wonderful lady. \"I've come back to you--I want to speak to you!\"\r\n",
      "The need had been a rapid growth, but it was clearly immense. \"May I\r\n",
      "confide in you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her instant overflow left Mrs. Gracedew both astonished and\r\n",
      "amused. \"You too?\" she laughed. \"Why it _is_ good we come\r\n",
      "over!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is, indeed!\" Cora gratefully echoed. \"You were so very kind\r\n",
      "to me and seemed to think me so curious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mirth of her friend redoubled. \"Well, I loved you for it, and it\r\n",
      "was nothing moreover to what you thought _me_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Prodmore found, for this, no denial--she only presented her frank\r\n",
      "high colour. \"I loved _you_. But I'm the worst!\" she generously\r\n",
      "added. \"And I'm solitary.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, so am I!\" Mrs. Gracedew declared with gaiety, but with\r\n",
      "emphasis. \"A _very_ queer thing always _is_ solitary! But, since we\r\n",
      "have that link, by all means confide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I was met here by tremendous news.\" Cora produced it with a\r\n",
      "purple glow. \"He wants me to marry him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew looked amiably receptive, but as if she failed as yet to\r\n",
      "follow. \"'He' wants you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Papa, of course. He has settled it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew was still vague. \"Settled what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, the whole question. That I must take him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew seemed to frown at her own scattered wits. \"But, my\r\n",
      "dear, take _whom_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl looked surprised at this lapse of her powers. \"Why, Captain\r\n",
      "Yule, who just went up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Mrs. Gracedew with a full stare. \"Oh!\" she repeated,\r\n",
      "looking straight away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought you would know,\" Cora gently explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her friend's eyes, with a kinder light now, came back to her. \"I\r\n",
      "didn't know.\" Mrs. Gracedew looked, in truth, as if that had been\r\n",
      "sufficiently odd, and seemed also to wonder at two or three things\r\n",
      "more. It all, however, broke quickly into a question. \"Has Captain\r\n",
      "Yule asked you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, but he _will_\"--Cora was clear as a bell. \"He'll do it\r\n",
      "to keep the house. It's mortgaged to papa, and Captain Yule buys it\r\n",
      "back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her friend had an illumination that was rapid for the way it\r\n",
      "spread. \"By marrying you?\" she quavered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora, under further parental instruction, had plainly mastered the\r\n",
      "subject. \"By giving me his name and his position. They're awfully\r\n",
      "great, and they're the price, don't you see?\" she modestly\r\n",
      "mentioned. \"_My_ price. Papa's price. Papa wants them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew had caught hold; yet there were places where her grasp\r\n",
      "was weak, and she had, strikingly, begun again to reflect. \"But\r\n",
      "his name and his position, great as they may be, are his dreadful\r\n",
      "politics!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora threw herself with energy into this advance. \"You _know_ about\r\n",
      "his dreadful politics? He's to change them,\" she recited, \"to get\r\n",
      "_me_. And if he gets me----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He keeps the house?\"--Mrs. Gracedew snatched it up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora continued to show her schooling. \"I go _with_ it--he's to have\r\n",
      "us both. But only,\" she admonishingly added, \"if he changes. The\r\n",
      "question is--_will_ he change?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew appeared profoundly to entertain it. \"I see. _Will_\r\n",
      "he change?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora's consideration of it went even further. \"_Has_ he changed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It went--and the effect was odd--a little too far for her companion, in\r\n",
      "whom, just discernibly, it had touched the spring of impatience. \"My\r\n",
      "dear child, how in the world should _I_ know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Cora knew exactly how anyone would know. \"He hasn't seemed to\r\n",
      "care enough for the house. _Does_ he care?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew moved away, passed over to the fireplace, and stood a\r\n",
      "moment looking at the old armorial fire-back she had praised to its\r\n",
      "master--yet not, it must be added, as if she particularly saw it. Then\r\n",
      "as she faced about: \"You had better ask him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They stood thus confronted, with the fine old interval between them,\r\n",
      "and the girl's air was for a moment that of considering such a\r\n",
      "course. \"If he does care,\" she said at last, \"he'll propose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, from where she stood in relation to the stairs, saw at\r\n",
      "this point the subject of their colloquy restored to view: Captain Yule\r\n",
      "was just upon them--he had turned the upper landing. The sight of him\r\n",
      "forced from her in a flash an ejaculation that she tried, however,\r\n",
      "to keep private--\"He does care!\" She passed swiftly, before he\r\n",
      "reached them, back to the girl and, in a quick whisper, but with full\r\n",
      "conviction, let her have it: \"He'll propose!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her movement had made her friend aware, and the young man, hurrying\r\n",
      "down, was now in the hall. Cora, at his hurry, looked dismay--\"Then I\r\n",
      "fly!\" With which, casting about for a direction, she reached the door\r\n",
      "to the court.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Captain Yule, however, at this result of his return, expressed instant\r\n",
      "regret. \"I drive Miss Prodmore away!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, more quickly still, eased off the situation. \"It's\r\n",
      "all right!\" She had embraced both parties with a smile, but it was\r\n",
      "most liberal now for Cora. \"Do you mind, one moment?\"--it conveyed,\r\n",
      "unmistakeably, a full intelligence and a fine explanation. \"I've\r\n",
      "something to say to Captain Yule.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora stood in the doorway, robust against the garden-light, and looking\r\n",
      "from one to the other. \"Yes--but I've also something more to say\r\n",
      "to _you_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you mean now?\" the young man asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the first time he had spoken to her, and her hesitation might\r\n",
      "have signified a maidenly flutter. \"No--but before she goes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew took it amiably up. \"Come back, then; I'm not\r\n",
      "going.\" And there was both dismissal and encouragement in the way\r\n",
      "that, as on the occasion of the girl's former retreat, she blew her\r\n",
      "a familiar kiss. Cora, still with her face to them, waited just enough\r\n",
      "to show that she took it without a response; then, with a quick turn,\r\n",
      "dashed out, while Mrs. Gracedew looked at their visitor in vague\r\n",
      "surprise. \"What's the matter with her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had turned away as soon as she spoke, moving as far from him as\r\n",
      "she had moved a few moments before from Cora. The silence that, as he\r\n",
      "watched her, followed her question would have been seen by a spectator\r\n",
      "to be a hard one for either to break. \"I don't know what's\r\n",
      "the matter with her,\" he said at last; \"I'm afraid I only know\r\n",
      "what's the matter with _me_. It will doubtless give you pleasure to\r\n",
      "learn,\" he added, \"that I've closed with Mr. Prodmore.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a speech that, strangely enough, seemed but half to dissipate\r\n",
      "the hush. Mrs. Gracedew reached the great chimney again; again she\r\n",
      "stood there with her face averted; and when she finally replied it\r\n",
      "was in other words than he might have supposed himself naturally to\r\n",
      "inspire. \"I thought you said he gave you time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; but you produced just now so deep an effect on me that I\r\n",
      "thought best not to take any.\" He appeared to listen to a sound from\r\n",
      "above, and, for a moment, under this impulse, his eyes travelled about\r\n",
      "almost as if he were alone. Then he completed, with deliberation, his\r\n",
      "statement. \"I came upon him right there, and I burnt my ships.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew continued not to meet his face. \"You do what he\r\n",
      "requires?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man was markedly, consciously caught. \"I do what he\r\n",
      "requires. I felt the tremendous force of all you said to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned round on him now, as if perhaps with a slight sharpness, the\r\n",
      "face of responsibility--even, it might be, of reproach. \"So did I--or\r\n",
      "I shouldn't have said it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was doubtless this element of justification in her tone that drew\r\n",
      "from him a laugh a tiny trifle dry. \"You're perhaps not aware that\r\n",
      "you wield an influence of which it's not too much to say----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he paused at the important point so long that she took him\r\n",
      "up. \"To say what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that it's practically irresistible!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It sounded a little as if it had not been what he first meant;\r\n",
      "but it made her, none the less, still graver and just faintly\r\n",
      "ironical. \"You've given me the most flattering proof of my\r\n",
      "influence that I've ever enjoyed in my life!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fixed her very hard, now distinctly so mystified that he could only\r\n",
      "wonder what different recall of her previous attitude she would have\r\n",
      "looked for. \"This was inevitable, dear madam, from the moment you had\r\n",
      "converted me--and in about three minutes too!--into the absolute echo\r\n",
      "of your raptures.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing was, indeed, more extraordinary than her air of having suddenly\r\n",
      "forgotten them. \"My 'raptures'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was amazed. \"Why, about my home.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He might look her through and through, but she had no eyes for himself,\r\n",
      "though she had now quitted the fireplace and finally recognised this\r\n",
      "allusion. \"Oh, yes--your home!\" From where had she come back to\r\n",
      "it? \"It's a nice tattered, battered old thing.\" This account\r\n",
      "of it was the more shrunken that her observation, even as she spoke,\r\n",
      "freshly went the rounds. \"It has defects of course\"--with this\r\n",
      "renewed attention they appeared suddenly to strike her. They had\r\n",

      "She listened to this account of the matter as she might have gazed,\r\n",
      "from afar, at some queer object that was scarce distinguishable. It\r\n",
      "left her a moment in the deepest thought, but she presently recovered\r\n",
      "her tone. \"Let me then congratulate you on at last knowing what you\r\n",
      "want!\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He had such an air of proposing a bargain, of making the wait a\r\n",
      "condition, that she had to look it well in the face. The result of\r\n",
      "her doing so, however, was apparently a strong sense that she could\r\n",
      "give him no pledge. Her silence, after a moment, expressed that; but,\r\n",
      "for a further emphasis, moving away, she sank suddenly into the chair\r\n",
      "she had already occupied and in which, serious again and very upright,\r\n",
      "she continued to withhold her promise. \"Go up to him!\" she simply\r\n",
      "repeated. He obeyed, with an abrupt turn, mounting briskly enough\r\n",
      "several steps, but pausing midway and looking back at her as if he were\r\n",
      "after all irresolute. He was in fact so much so that, at the sight of\r\n",
      "her still in her chair and alone by his cold hearth, he descended a\r\n",
      "few steps again and seemed, with too much decidedly on his mind, on the\r\n",
      "point of breaking out. She had sat a minute in such thought, figuring\r\n",
      "him clearly as gone, that at the sound of his return she sprang up\r\n",
      "with a protest. This checked him afresh, and he remained where he had\r\n",
      "paused, still on the ascent and exchanging with her a look to which\r\n",
      "neither party was inspired, oddly enough, to contribute a word. It\r\n",
      "struck him, without words, at all events, as enough, and he now took\r\n",
      "his upward course at such a pace that he presently disappeared. She\r\n",
      "listened awhile to his retreating tread; then her own, on the old flags\r\n",
      "of the hall, became rapid, though, it may perhaps be added, directed\r\n",
      "to no visible end. It conveyed her, in the great space, from point to\r\n",
      "point, but she now for the first time moved there without attention and\r\n",
      "without joy, her course determined by a series of such inward throbs as\r\n",
      "might have been the suppressed beats of a speech. A real observer, had\r\n",
      "such a monster been present, would have followed this tacit evolution\r\n",
      "from sign to sign and from shade to shade. \"Why didn't he tell me\r\n",

      "the open doorway. Mrs. Gracedew's was a thought, however, that, even\r\n",
      "when desperate, was never quite vanquished, and it found a presentable\r\n",
      "public solution in the pieces of the vase smashed by Chivers and just\r\n",

      "he suddenly turned up there, and I took a little quiet walk with him\r\n",
      "which gave you time to get here before me and of which my father is in\r\n",
      "a state of ignorance that I don't know whether to regard as desirable\r\n",
      "or dreadful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, attentive and wise, might have been, for her face, the\r\n",
      "old family solicitor. \"You want me then to _inform_ your father?\"\r\n",
      "It was a wonderful intonation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Cora, for that matter too, might suddenly have become under this\r\n",
      "touch the prodigal with a list of debts. She seemed an instant to look\r\n",
      "out of a blurred office window-pane at a grey London sky; then she\r\n",
      "broke away. \"I really don't know _what_ I want. I think,\" she\r\n",
      "honestly admitted, \"I just want kindness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew's expression might have hinted--but not for too\r\n",
      "long--that Bedford Row was an odd place to apply for it; she appeared\r\n",
      "for an instant to make the revolving office-chair creak. \"What do you\r\n",
      "mean by kindness?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora was a model client--she perfectly knew. \"I mean help.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew closed an inkstand with a clap and locked a couple of\r\n",
      "drawers. \"What do you mean by help?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The client's inevitable answer seemed to perch on the girl's lips:\r\n",
      "\"A thousand pounds.\" But it came out in another, in a much more\r\n",
      "charming form. \"I mean that I love him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The family solicitor got up: it was a high figure. \"And does he love\r\n",
      "_you_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora hesitated. \"Ask _him_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew weighed the necessity. \"Where is he?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Waiting.\" And the girl's glance, removed from her companion and\r\n",
      "wandering aloft and through space, gave the scale of his patience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her adviser, however, required the detail. \"But _where_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora briefly demurred again. \"In that funny old grotto.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew thought. \"Funny?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Half-way from the park gate. It's very _nice_!\" Cora more\r\n",
      "eagerly added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew continued to reflect. \"Oh, I know it!\" She spoke as\r\n",
      "if she had known it most of her life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her tone encouraged her client. \"Then will you see him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\" This time it was almost dry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. If you want help----\" Mrs. Gracedew, still musing, explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--you want a great deal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, so much!\"--Cora but too woefully took it in. \"I want,\" she\r\n",
      "quavered, \"all there is!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--you shall have it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All there is?\"--she convulsively held her to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew had finally mastered it. \"I'll see your father.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You dear, delicious lady!\" Her young friend had again encompassed\r\n",
      "her; but, passive and preoccupied, she showed some of the chill of\r\n",
      "apprehension. It was indeed as if to meet this that Cora went earnestly\r\n",
      "on: \"He's intensely sympathetic!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your father?\" Mrs. Gracedew had her reserves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, no--the other person. I so believe in him!\" Cora cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew looked at her a moment. \"Then so do I--and I like him\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, he does that,\" the girl hurried on, \"far more than Captain\r\n",
      "Yule--I could see just with one glance that _he_ doesn't at all. Papa\r\n",
      "has of course seen the young man I mean, but we've been so sure\r\n",
      "papa would hate it that we've had to be awfully careful. He's the\r\n",
      "son of the richest man at Bellborough, he's Granny's godson, and\r\n",
      "he'll inherit his father's business, which is simply immense. Oh,\r\n",
      "from the point of view of the things he's _in_\"--and Cora found\r\n",
      "herself sharp on this--\"he's quite as good as papa himself. He\r\n",
      "has been away for three days, and if he met me at the station, where,\r\n",
      "on his way back, he has to change, it was by the merest chance in the\r\n",
      "world. I wouldn't love him,\" she brilliantly wound up, \"if he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"A man's always nice if you _will_ love him!\" Mrs. Gracedew\r\n",

      "\"As sure as that the other one doesn't.\"\r\n",

      "too late.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Yes, but----\" Cora's eyes rolled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion invitingly laughed. \"But it's enough?\"\r\n",

      "\"Not a letter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hall Pegg?\" Mrs. Gracedew had winced, but she quickly recovered\r\n",
      "herself, and, for a further articulation, appeared, from delicacy, to\r\n",
      "form the sound only with her mind. The sound she formed with her lips\r\n",
      "was, after an instant, simply \"Oh!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was to the combination of the spoken and the unspoken that Cora\r\n",
      "desperately replied. \"It sounds like a hat-rack!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Hall Pegg'? 'Hall Pegg'?\" Mrs. Gracedew now made it, like\r\n",
      "a questionable coin, ring upon the counter. But it lay there as lead\r\n",
      "and without, for a moment, her taking it up again. \"How many has your\r\n",
      "father?\" she inquired instead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How many names?\" Miss Prodmore seemed dimly to see that there was\r\n",
      "no hope in that. \"He somehow makes out five.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, that's _too_ many!\" Mrs. Gracedew jeeringly declared.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, all sorts. 'Marmaduke Clement----'\" Cora tried to recall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, however, had already checked her. \"I see--'Marmaduke\r\n",
      "Clement' will do.\" She appeared for a minute intent, but, as with\r\n",
      "an energetic stoop, she picked up Mr. Pegg. \"But so will yours,\"\r\n",
      "she said, with decision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It fell a little flat in the noble space, but Mrs. Gracedew's manner\r\n",
      "quickly covered it. \"It won't make you a bit less charming.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora wondered--she hoped. \"Only for papa.\"\r\n",

      "ask. \"Never for _me_!\" she soothingly declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora took this in with deep thanks that gripped and patted her\r\n",
      "companion's hand. \"You accept it more than gracefully. But if you\r\n",
      "could only make _him_----!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "light. \"Well, it will be difficult--but I will.\"\r\n",

      "Doubt paled before it. \"Oh, you heavenly thing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew after an instant, sustained by this appreciation, went a\r\n",
      "step further. \"And I'll make him _say_ he does!\"\r\n",

      "Cora closed her eyes with the dream of it. \"Oh, if I could only hear\r\n",
      "him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "_I_ do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora quickly considered; then, with prompt accommodation, gave the\r\n",
      "comfortable measure of her faith. \"Yes--I think it will.\" She was\r\n",
      "quite ready to retire. \"I'll give you time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Gracedew; \"but before you give me time\r\n",
      "give me something better.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But how?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By a clear assurance.\" The charming woman's fine face now gave\r\n",
      "the real example of clearness. \"That if Captain Yule should propose\r\n",
      "to you, you would unconditionally refuse him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora flushed with the surprise of its being only that. \"With my dying\r\n",
      "breath!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew scanned her robust vitality. \"Will you make it even\r\n",
      "a promise?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl looked about her in solid certainty. \"Do you want me to\r\n",
      "sign----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "again. \"Kiss me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cora flew to her arms, and the compact had scarce been sealed\r\n",
      "before the younger of the parties was already at the passage to the\r\n",
      "front. \"We meet of course at the station.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her confederate had no need to think. \"Can't you guess?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bang of the house-door, the next minute, so helped the answer to\r\n",
      "the riddle as fairly to force it, when she found herself alone, from\r\n",
      "her lips. \"At that funny old grotto? Well,\" she sighed, \"I _like_\r\n",
      "funny old grottos!\" She found herself alone, however, only for a\r\n",
      "minute; Mr. Prodmore's formidable presence had darkened the door from\r\n",
      "the court.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My daughter's not here?\" he demanded from the threshold.\r\n",

      "\"Your daughter's not here.\" She had rapidly got under arms.\r\n",
      "\"But it's a convenience to me, Mr. Prodmore, that _you_ are,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her interlocutor crossed straight to the morning-room. \"I shall be\r\n",
      "delighted to answer your question, but I must first put my hand on Miss\r\n",
      "Prodmore.\" This hand the next instant stayed itself on the latch, and\r\n",
      "he appealed to the amiable visitor. \"Unless indeed she's occupied\r\n",
      "in there with Captain Yule?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The amiable visitor met the appeal. \"I don't think she's\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore came straight away from the door. \"Then where the deuce\r\n",
      "_is_ Captain Yule?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The amiable visitor turned a trifle less direct. \"His absence, for\r\n",
      "which I'm responsible, is just what renders the inquiry I speak of\r\n",
      "to you possible.\" She had already assumed a most inquiring air, yet\r\n",
      "it was soon clear that she needed every advantage her manner could give\r\n",
      "her. \"What will you take----? what will you take----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had the sound, as she faltered, of a general question, and\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore raised his eyebrows. \"Take? Nothing, thank you--I've\r\n",
      "just had a cup of tea.\" Then suddenly, as if on the broad hint:\r\n",
      "\"Won't _you_ have one?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, with pleasure--but not yet.\" She looked about her again; she\r\n",
      "was now at close quarters and, concentrated, anxious, pressed her hand\r\n",
      "a moment to her brow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\" She was positive. \"No.\" Her eyes consciously wandered.\r\n",
      "\"I want to know how you'd value----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took her, as his own followed them, more quickly up, expanding in\r\n",
      "the presence of such a tribute from a real connoisseur. \"One of these\r\n",
      "charming old things that take your fancy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked at him straight now. \"They _all_ take my fancy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All?\" He enjoyed it as the joke of a rich person--the kind of joke\r\n",
      "he sometimes made himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Every single one!\" said Mrs. Gracedew. Then with still a finer\r\n",
      "shade of the familiar: \"Should you be willing to treat, Mr. Prodmore,\r\n",
      "for your interest in this property?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He threw back his head: she had scattered over the word \"interest\"\r\n",
      "such a friendly, faded colour. She was either _not_ joking or was rich\r\n",
      "indeed; and there was a place always kept in his conversation for the\r\n",
      "arrival of money, as there is always a box in a well-appointed theatre\r\n",
      "for that of royalty. \"Am I to take it from you then that you _know_\r\n",
      "about my interest----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everything!\" said Mrs. Gracedew with a world of wit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Excuse me, madam!\"--he himself was now more reserved. \"You\r\n",
      "don't know everything if you don't know that my interest--considerable\r\n",
      "as it might well have struck you--has just ceased to exist.\r\n",
      "I've given it up\"--Mr. Prodmore softened the blow--\"for\r\n",
      "a handsome equivalent.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The blow fell indeed light enough. \"You mean for a handsome\r\n",
      "son-in-law?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It will be by some such description as the term you use that I\r\n",
      "shall doubtless, in the future, permit myself, in the common course,\r\n",
      "to allude to Captain Yule. Unless indeed I call him----\" But\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore dropped the bolder thought. \"It will depend on what he\r\n",
      "calls _me_.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew covered him a moment with the largeness of her\r\n",
      "charity. \"Won't it depend a little on what your daughter herself\r\n",
      "calls him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore seriously considered. \"No. That,\" he declared with\r\n",
      "delicacy, \"will be between the happy pair.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Am I to take it from you then--I adopt your excellent phrase,\"\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew said--\"that Miss Prodmore has already accepted him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion, with his head still in the air, seemed to signify that\r\n",
      "he simply put it down on the table and that she could take it or not\r\n",
      "as she liked. \"Her character--formed by my assiduous care--enables me\r\n",
      "to locate her, I may say even to _time_ her, from moment to moment.\"\r\n",
      "His massive watch, as he opened it, further sustained him in this\r\n",
      "process. \"It's my assured conviction that she's accepting him\r\n",
      "while we stand here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew was so affected by his assured conviction that, with\r\n",
      "an odd, inarticulate sound, she forbore to stand longer--she rapidly\r\n",
      "moved away, taking one of the brief excursions of step and sense that\r\n",
      "had been for her, from the first, under the noble roof, so many dumb\r\n",
      "but decisive communions. But it was soon over, and she floated back on\r\n",
      "a wave that showed her to be, since she had let herself go, by this\r\n",
      "time quite in the swing and describing a considerable curve. \"Dear\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, why are you so imprudent as to make your daughter\r\n",
      "afraid of you? You should have taught her to confide in you. She has\r\n",
      "clearly shown me,\" she almost soothingly pursued, \"that she _can_\r\n",
      "confide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore, however, suddenly starting, looked far from\r\n",
      "soothed. \"She confides in _you_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You may take it from me!\" Mrs. Gracedew laughed. \"Let me suggest\r\n",
      "that, as fortune has thrown us together a minute, you follow her good\r\n",
      "example.\" She put out a reassuring hand--she could perfectly show\r\n",
      "him the way. \"Tell me, for instance, the ground of your objection\r\n",
      "to poor Mr. Pegg. I mean Mr. Pegg of Bellborough, Mr. Hall Pegg, the\r\n",
      "godson of your daughter's grandmother and the associate of his father\r\n",
      "in their flourishing house; to whom (as _he_ is to _it_ and to _her_)\r\n",
      "Miss Prodmore's devotedly attached.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore had in the course of this speech availed himself of the\r\n",
      "support of the nearest chair, where, in spite of his subsidence, he\r\n",
      "appeared in his amazement twice his natural size. \"It has gone so far\r\n",
      "as _that_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She rose before him as if in triumph. \"It has gone so far that you\r\n",
      "had better let it go the rest of the way!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had lost breath, but he had positively gained dignity. \"It's too\r\n",
      "monstrous, to have plotted to keep me in the dark!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, it's only when you're kept in the dark that your daughter's\r\n",
      "kept in the light!\" She argued it with a candour that might\r\n",
      "have served for brilliancy. \"It's at her own earnest request\r\n",
      "that I plead to you for her liberty of choice. She's an honest\r\n",
      "girl--perhaps even a peculiar girl; and she's not a baby. You\r\n",
      "over-do, I think, the nursing. She has a perfect right to her\r\n",
      "preference.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Mr. Prodmore couldn't help taking it from her, and, this being\r\n",
      "the case, he still took it in the most convenient way. \"And pray\r\n",
      "haven't I a perfect right to mine?\" he asked from his chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She fairly seemed to serve it up to him--to put down the dish with a\r\n",
      "flourish. \"Not at her expense. You expect her to give up too much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what has she,\" he appealed, \"expected _me_ to give up? What\r\n",
      "but the desire of my heart and the dream of my life? Captain Yule\r\n",
      "announced to me but a few minutes since his intention to offer her his\r\n",
      "hand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She faced him on it as over the table. \"Well, if he does, I think\r\n",
      "he'll simply find----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Find what?\" They looked at each other hard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, that she won't have it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, Mr. Prodmore now sprang up. \"She _will_!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She won't!\" Mrs. Gracedew more distinctly repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She _shall_!\" returned her adversary, making for the staircase\r\n",
      "with the evident sense of where reinforcement might be most required.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, however, with a spring, was well before him. \"She\r\n",
      "shan't!\" She spoke with positive passion and practically so barred\r\n",
      "the way that he stood arrested and bewildered, and they faced each\r\n",
      "other, for a flash, like enemies. But it all went out, on her part, in\r\n",
      "a flash too--in a sudden wonderful smile. \"Now tell me how much!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore continued to glare--the sweat was on his brow. But while\r\n",
      "he slowly wiped it with a pocket-handkerchief of splendid scarlet\r\n",
      "silk, he remained so silent that he would have had for a spectator the\r\n",
      "effect of meeting in a manner her question. More formally to answer\r\n",
      "it he had at last to turn away. \"How can I tell you anything so\r\n",
      "preposterous?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was all ready to inform him. \"Simply by computing the total\r\n",
      "amount to which, for your benefit, this unhappy estate is burdened.\"\r\n",
      "He listened with his back presented, but that appeared to strike her,\r\n",
      "as she fixed this expanse, as an encouragement to proceed. \"If\r\n",
      "I've troubled you by showing you that your speculation is built on\r\n",
      "the sand, let me atone for it by my eagerness to take off your hands an\r\n",
      "investment from which you derive so little profit.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He at last gave her his attention, but quite as if there were nothing\r\n",
      "in it. \"And pray what profit will _you_ derive----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, that's my own secret!\" She would show him as well no glimpse\r\n",
      "of it--her laugh but rattled the box. \"I want this house!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So do I, damn me!\" he roundly returned; \"and that's why I've\r\n",
      "practically paid for it!\" He stuffed away his pocket-handkerchief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nevertheless something in her that could hold him, and it\r\n",
      "came out, after an instant, quietly and reasonably enough. \"I'll\r\n",
      "practically pay for it, Mr. Prodmore--if you'll only tell me your\r\n",
      "figure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My figure?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your figure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore waited--then removed his eyes from her face. He appeared\r\n",
      "to have waited on purpose to let her hope of a soft answer fall from a\r\n",
      "greater height. \"My figure would be quite my own!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then it will match, in that respect,\" Mrs. Gracedew laughed,\r\n",
      "\"this overture, which is quite _my_ own! As soon as you've let me\r\n",
      "know it I cable to Missoura Top to have the money sent right out to\r\n",
      "you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore surveyed in a superior manner this artless picture of a\r\n",
      "stroke of business. \"You imagine that having the money sent right out\r\n",
      "to me will make you owner of this place?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She herself, with her head on one side, studied her sketch and seemed\r\n",
      "to twirl her pencil. \"No--not quite. But I'll settle the rest with\r\n",
      "Captain Yule.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her companion looked, over his white waistcoat, at his large tense\r\n",
      "shoes, the patent-leather shine of which so flashed propriety back at\r\n",
      "him that he became, the next moment, doubly erect on it. \"Captain\r\n",
      "Yule has nothing to sell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She received the remark with surprise. \"Then what have you been\r\n",
      "trying to buy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had touched in himself even a sharper spring. \"Do you mean to\r\n",
      "say,\" he cried, \"you want to buy _that_?\" She stared at his\r\n",
      "queer emphasis, which was intensified by a queer grimace; then she\r\n",
      "turned from him with a change of colour and an ejaculation that led to\r\n",
      "nothing more, after a few seconds, than a somewhat conscious silence--a\r\n",
      "silence of which Mr. Prodmore made use to follow up his unanswered\r\n",
      "question with another. \"Is your proposal that I should transfer my\r\n",
      "investment to you for the mere net amount of it your conception of a\r\n",
      "fair bargain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This second inquiry, however, she could, as she slowly came round,\r\n",
      "substantially meet. \"Pray, then, what is yours?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mine would be, not that I should simply get my money back, but that\r\n",
      "I should get the effective value of the house.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew considered it. \"But isn't the effective value of the\r\n",
      "house just what your money expresses?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lid of his hard left eye, the harder of the two, just dipped\r\n",
      "with the effect of a wink. \"No, madam. It's just what _yours_\r\n",
      "does. It's moreover just what your lips have already expressed so\r\n",
      "distinctly!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She clearly did her best to follow him. \"To those people--when I\r\n",
      "showed the place off?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore laughed. \"You seemed to be _taking_ bids then!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was candid, but earnest. \"Taking them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, like an auctioneer! You ran it up high!\" And Mr. Prodmore\r\n",
      "laughed again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned a little pale, but it added to her brightness. \"I\r\n",
      "certainly did, if saying it was charming----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Charming?\" Mr. Prodmore broke in. \"You said it was magnificent.\r\n",
      "You said it was unique. That was your very word. You said\r\n",
      "it was the _perfect_ specimen of its class in England.\" He was more\r\n",
      "than accusatory, he was really crushing. \"Oh, you got in deep!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was indeed an indictment, and her smile was perhaps now rather\r\n",
      "set. \"Possibly. But taunting me with my absurd high spirits and\r\n",
      "the dreadful liberties I took doesn't in the least tell me how deep\r\n",
      "_you're_ in!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For you, Mrs. Gracedew?\" He took a few steps, looking at his\r\n",
      "shoes again and as if to give her time to plead--since he wished to be\r\n",
      "quite fair--that it was _not_ for her. \"I'm in to the tune of fifty\r\n",
      "thousand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was silent, on this announcement, so long that he once more faced\r\n",
      "her; but if what he showed her in doing so at last made her speak, it\r\n",
      "also took the life from her tone. \"That's a great deal of money,\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tone didn't matter, but only the truth it expressed, which he\r\n",
      "so thoroughly liked to hear. \"So I've often had occasion to say to\r\n",
      "myself!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If it's a large sum for you, then,\" said Mrs. Gracedew,\r\n",
      "\"it's a still larger one for me.\" She sank into a chair with\r\n",
      "a vague melancholy; such a mass loomed huge, and she sat down before\r\n",
      "it as a solitary herald, resigning himself with a sigh to wait, might\r\n",
      "have leaned against a tree before a besieged city. \"We women\"--she\r\n",
      "wished to conciliate--\"have more modest ideas.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Prodmore would scarce condescend to parley. \"Is it\r\n",
      "as a 'modest idea' that you describe your extraordinary\r\n",
      "intrusion----?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His question scarce reached her; she was so lost for the moment in the\r\n",
      "sense of innocent community with her sex. \"I mean I think we measure\r\n",
      "things often rather more exactly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There would have been no doubt of Mr. Prodmore's very different\r\n",
      "community as he rudely replied: \"Then you measured _this_ thing\r\n",
      "exactly half an hour ago!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a long way to go back, but Mrs. Gracedew, in her seat, musingly\r\n",
      "made the journey, from which she then suddenly returned with a\r\n",
      "harmless, indeed quite a happy, memento. \"Was I _very_ grotesque?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He demurred. \"Grotesque?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean--_did_ I go on about it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore would have no general descriptions; he was specific, he\r\n",
      "was vivid. \"You banged the desk. You raved. You shrieked.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a note she appeared indulgently, almost tenderly, to\r\n",
      "recognise. \"We _do_ shriek at Missoura Top!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know what you do at Missoura Top, but I know what you did\r\n",
      "at Covering End!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She warmed at last to his tone. \"So do _I_ then! I surprised you. You\r\n",
      "weren't at all prepared----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took her briskly up. \"No--and I'm not prepared yet!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew could quite see it. \"Yes, you're too astonished.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My astonishment's my own affair,\" he retorted--\"not less so\r\n",
      "than my memory!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I yield to your memory,\" said the charming woman, \"and I\r\n",
      "confess my extravagance. But quite, you know, _as_ extravagance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't at all know,\"--Mr. Prodmore shook it off,--\"nor what\r\n",
      "you _call_ extravagance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, banging the desk. Raving. Shrieking. I over-did it,\" she\r\n",
      "exclaimed; \"I wanted to please you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had too happy a beauty, as she sat in her high-backed chair,\r\n",
      "to have been condemned to say that to any man without a certain\r\n",
      "effect. The effect on Mr. Prodmore was striking. \"So you said,\" he\r\n",
      "sternly inquired, \"what you didn't believe?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She flushed with the avowal. \"Yes--for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at her hard. \"For _me_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under his eye--for her flush continued--she slowly got up. \"And for\r\n",
      "those good people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\"--he sounded most sarcastic. \"Should you like me to call\r\n",
      "them back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\" She was still gay enough, but very decided. \"I took them\r\n",
      "in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And now you want to take _me_?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Prodmore!\" she almost pitifully, but not quite adequately,\r\n",
      "moaned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He appeared to feel he had gone a little far. \"Well, if we're not\r\n",
      "what you say----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes?\"--she looked up askance at the stroke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why the devil do you want us?\" The question rang out and was\r\n",
      "truly for the poor lady, as the quick suffusion of her eyes showed,\r\n",
      "a challenge it would take more time than he left her properly to pick\r\n",
      "up. He left her in fact no time at all before he went on: \"Why the\r\n",
      "devil did you say you'd offer fifty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked quite wan and seemed to wonder. \"_Did_ I say that?\" She\r\n",
      "could only let his challenge lie. \"It was a figure of speech!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then that's the kind of figure we're talking about!\" Mr.\r\n",
      "Prodmore's sharpness would have struck an auditor as the more\r\n",
      "effective that, on the heels of this thrust, seeing the ancient butler\r\n",
      "reappear, he dropped the victim of it as comparatively unimportant and\r\n",
      "directed his fierceness instantly to Chivers, who mildly gaped at him\r\n",
      "from the threshold of the court. \"Have you seen Miss Prodmore? If you\r\n",
      "haven't, find her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew addressed their visitor in a very different tone, though\r\n",
      "with the full authority of her benevolence. \"You won't, my dear\r\n",
      "man.\" To Mr. Prodmore also she continued bland. \"I happen to know\r\n",
      "she has gone for a walk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A walk--alone?\" Mr. Prodmore gasped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--not alone.\" Mrs. Gracedew looked at Chivers with a vague\r\n",
      "smile of appeal for help, but he could only give her, from under his\r\n",
      "bent old brow, the blank decency of his wonder. It seemed to make her\r\n",
      "feel afresh that she was, after all, alone--so that in her loneliness,\r\n",
      "which had also its fine sad charm, she risked another brush with their\r\n",
      "formidable friend. \"Cora has gone with Mr. Pegg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pegg has _been_ here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was like a splash in a full basin, but she launched the whole\r\n",
      "craft. \"He walked with her from the station.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When she arrived?\" Mr. Prodmore rose like outraged Neptune.\r\n",
      "\"That's why she was so late?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew assented. \"Why I got here first. I get everywhere\r\n",
      "first!\" she bravely laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Prodmore looked round him in purple dismay--it was so clearly a\r\n",
      "question for him where _he_ should get, and what! \"In which direction\r\n",
      "did they go?\" he imperiously asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His rudeness was too evident to be more than lightly recognised. \"I\r\n",
      "think I must let you ascertain for yourself!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All he could do then was to shout it to Chivers. \"Call my carriage,\r\n",
      "you ass!\" After which, as the old man melted into the vestibule,\r\n",
      "he dashed about blindly for his hat, pounced upon it and seemed,\r\n",
      "furious but helpless, on the point of hurling it at his contradictress\r\n",
      "as a gage of battle. \"So you abetted and protected this wicked, low\r\n",
      "intrigue?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had something in her face now that was indifferent to any\r\n",
      "violence. \"You're too disappointed to see your real interest:\r\n",
      "oughtn't I therefore in common charity to point it out to you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He faced her question so far as to treat it as one. \"What do _you_\r\n",
      "know of my disappointment?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was something in his very harshness that even helped her, for it\r\n",
      "added at this moment to her sense of making out in his narrowed glare a\r\n",
      "couple of tears of rage. \"I know everything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you know of my real interest?\" he went on as if he had not\r\n",
      "heard her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know enough for my purpose--which is to offer you a handsome\r\n",
      "condition. I think it's not I who have protected the happy\r\n",
      "understanding that you call by so ugly a name; it's the happy\r\n",
      "understanding that has put me\"--she gained confidence--\"well, in a\r\n",
      "position. Do drive after them, if you like--but catch up with them only\r\n",
      "to forgive them. If you'll do that, I'll pay your price.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The particular air with which, a minute after Mrs. Gracedew had spoken\r\n",
      "these words, Mr. Prodmore achieved a transfer of his attention to the\r\n",
      "inside of his hat--this special shade of majesty would have taxed\r\n",
      "the descriptive resources of the most accomplished reporter. It is\r\n",
      "none the less certain that he appeared for some time absorbed in that\r\n",
      "receptacle--appeared at last to breathe into it hard. \"What do you\r\n",
      "call my price?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, the sum you just mentioned--fifty thousand!\" Mrs. Gracedew\r\n",
      "feverishly quavered.\r\n",

      "He appeared to consider it. \"To Missoura Top?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Not a bit!\" she returned, with equal passion--\"I was only too\r\n",

      "pour out money, you move a mountain, and to let you 'go,' to\r\n",
      "close the door fast behind you, is all I can figure out to do for\r\n",
      "you?\" His emotion trembled out of him with the stammer of a new\r\n",
      "language, but it was as if in a minute or two he had thrown over all\r\n",
      "consciousness. \"You're the most generous--you're the noblest of\r\n",

      "wonderful chance. \"It brought _you_ at the same happy hour! I've\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You've done it for a proud, poor man\"--his answer was quite\r\n",

      "of her now, and it broke, as he pressed her, as he pleaded, the\r\n",
      "helpless fall of his eloquence. \"Mrs. Gracedew--don't leave me.\"\r\n",
      "He jerked his head passionately at the whole place and the yellow\r\n",
      "afternoon. \"If you made me care----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was surely that you had made _me_ first!\" She laughed, and her\r\n",
      "laugh disengaged her, so that before he could reply she had again put\r\n",
      "space between them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He accepted the space now--he appeared so sure of his point. \"Then\r\n",
      "let me go on caring. When I asked you awhile back for some possible\r\n",
      "adjustment to my new source of credit, you simply put off the\r\n",
      "question--told me I must trust to time for it. Well,\" said Clement\r\n",
      "Yule, \"I've trusted to time so effectually that ten little minutes\r\n",

      "my life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She held him off, across the hall, for a time almost out of proportion\r\n",
      "to the previous wait he had just made so little of. Then at last\r\n",
      "also, when she answered, it might have passed for a plea for further\r\n",
      "postponement, even for a plea for mercy. \"Ah, Captain Yule----!\"\r\n",
      "But she turned suddenly off: the flower had been nipped in the bud by\r\n",
      "the re-entrance of Chivers, at whom his master veritably glowered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What the devil is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man showed the shock, but he had his duty. \"Another party.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gracedew, at this, wheeled round. \"The 'party up'!\" It\r\n",
      "brought back her voice--indeed, all her gaiety. And her gaiety was\r\n",
      "always determinant. \"Show them in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clement Yule's face fell while Chivers proceeded to obey. \"You'll\r\n",
      "_have_ them?\" he wailed across the hall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah! mayn't I be proud of my house?\" she tossed back at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her raised hand checked him. \"Hush!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fell back--the party was there. Chivers ushered it as he had ushered\r\n",
      "the other, making the most, this time, of more scanty material--four\r\n",
      "persons so spectacled, satchelled, shawled, and handbooked that they\r\n",
      "testified on the spot to a particular foreign origin and presented\r\n",
      "themselves indeed very much as tourists who, at an hotel, casting up\r\n",
      "the promise of comfort or the portent of cost, take possession, while\r\n",
      "they wait for their keys, with expert looks and free sounds. Clement\r\n",
      "Yule, who had receded, effacing himself, to the quarter opposed\r\n",
      "to that of his companion, addressed to their visitors a covert but\r\n",
      "dismayed stare and then, edging round, in his agitation, to the rear,\r\n",
      "instinctively sought relief by escape through the open passage. One of\r\n",
      "the invaders meanwhile--a broad-faced gentleman with long hair tucked\r\n",
      "behind his ears and a ring on each forefinger--had lost no time in\r\n",
      "showing he knew where to begin. He began at the top--the proper place,\r\n",
      "and took in the dark pictures ranged above the tapestry. \"Olt vamily\r\n",
      "bortraits?\"--he appealed to Chivers and spoke very loud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chivers rose to the occasion and, gracefully pawing the air, began\r\n",
      "also at the beginning. \"Dame Dorothy Yule--who lived to a hundred\r\n",
      "and one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A hundred and one--ach _so_!\" broke, with a resigned absence of\r\n",
      "criticism, from each of the interested group; another member of which,\r\n",
      "however, indicated with a somewhat fatigued skip the central figure of\r\n",
      "the series, the personage with the long white legs that Mrs. Gracedew\r\n",
      "had invited the previous inquirers to remark. \"Who's dis?\" the\r\n",
      "present inquirer asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question affected the lovely lady over by the fireplace as the\r\n",
      "trumpet of battle affects a generous steed. She flashed on the instant\r\n",
      "into the middle of the hall and into the friendliest and most familiar\r\n",
      "relation with everyone and with everything. \"John Anthony Yule,\r\n",
      "sir,--who passed away, poor duck, in his flower!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They met her with low salutations, a sweep of ugly shawls, and a brush\r\n",
      "of queer German hats: she had issued, to their glazed convergence,\r\n",
      "from the dusk of the Middle Ages and the shade of high pieces, and\r\n",
      "now stood there, beautiful and human and happy, in a light that,\r\n",
      "whatever it was for themselves, the very breadth of their attention,\r\n",
      "the expression of their serious faces, converted straightway for her\r\n",
      "into a new, and oh! into the right, one. To a detached observer of\r\n",
      "the whole it would have been promptly clear that she found herself\r\n",
      "striking these good people very much as the lawful heir had, half an\r\n",
      "hour before, struck another stranger--that she produced in them, in\r\n",
      "her setting of assured antiquity, quite the romantic vibration that\r\n",
      "she had responded to in the presence of that personage. They read\r\n",
      "her as she read _him_, and a bright and deepening cheer, reflected\r\n",
      "dimly in their thick thoroughness, went out from her as she accepted\r\n",
      "their reading. An impression was exchanged, for the minute, from side\r\n",
      "to side--their grave admiration of the finest feature of the curious\r\n",
      "house and the deep free radiance of her silent, grateful \"Why not?\"\r\n",
      "It made a passage of some intensity and some duration, of which the\r\n",
      "effect, indeed, the next minute, was to cause the only lady of the\r\n",
      "party--a matron of rich Jewish type, with small nippers on a huge nose\r\n",
      "and a face out of proportion to her little Freischuetz hat--to break\r\n",

      "Clement Yule, already fidgeting in his impatience back from the\r\n",
      "front, just occupied the arch, completed her thought, and filled her\r\n",
      "vision. \"Oh, that's my future husband!\" He caught the words,\r\n",
      "but answered them only by a long look at her as he moved, with a\r\n",
      "checked wildness of which she alone, of all the spectators, had a\r\n",
      "sense, straight across the hall again and to the other opening. He\r\n",
      "paused there as he had done before, then with a last dumb appeal to\r\n",

      "The critic's first duty in the presence of an\r\n",
      "author's collective works is to seek out some\r\n",

      "In some cases the critic will find express declarations;\r\n",
      "in other cases he will have to content himself\r\n",

      "of digressions as George Eliot, he has reason to\r\n",

      "homes with their tin cans, their brown\r\n",
      "pitchers, their rough curs, and their clusters of\r\n",
      "onions. In this world there are so many of these\r\n",
      "common, coarse people, who have no picturesque,\r\n",
      "sentimental wretchedness. It is so needful we\r\n",
      "should remember their existence, else we may happen\r\n",

      "I have come to the conclusion that human nature\r\n",
      "is loveable--the way I have learnt something of\r\n",
      "its deep pathos, its sublime mysteries--has been\r\n",
      "by living a great deal among people more or less\r\n",

      "But even in the absence of any such avowed\r\n",
      "predilections as these, a brief glance over the principal\r\n",
      "figures of her different works would assure\r\n",
      "us that our author's sympathies are with common\r\n",
      "people. Silas Marner is a linen-weaver, Adam\r\n",
      "Bede is a carpenter, Maggie Tulliver is a miller's\r\n",
      "daughter, Felix Holt is a watchmaker, Dinah Morris\r\n",
      "works in a factory, and Hetty Sorrel is a dairy-maid.\r\n",
      "Esther Lyon, indeed, is a daily governess;\r\n",
      "but Tito Melema alone is a scholar. In the _Scenes\r\n",
      "of Clerical Life_, the author is constantly slipping\r\n",
      "down from the clergymen, her heroes, to the most\r\n",
      "ignorant and obscure of their parishioners. Even\r\n",
      "in _Romola_ she consecrates page after page to the\r\n",
      "conversation of the Florentine populace. She is as\r\n",
      "unmistakably a painter of _bourgeois_ life as Thackeray\r\n",
      "was a painter of the life of drawing-rooms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her opportunities for the study of the manners\r\n",
      "of the solid lower classes have evidently been very\r\n",
      "great. We have her word for it that she has lived\r\n",
      "much among the farmers, mechanics, and small\r\n",
      "traders of that central region of England which\r\n",
      "she has made known to us under the name of Loamshire.\r\n",

      "she refers the action of most of her stories--the\r\n",
      "end of the last century and the beginning of the\r\n",
      "present--were so different from any that have been\r\n",
      "seen in America, that an American, in treating\r\n",
      "of her books, must be satisfied not to touch upon\r\n",
      "the question of their accuracy and fidelity as pictures\r\n",
      "of manners and customs. He can only say\r\n",

      "If he is a great admirer of George Eliot, he\r\n",
      "will indeed be tempted to affirm that they must\r\n",
      "be true. They offer a completeness, a rich density\r\n",
      "of detail, which could be the fruit only of a long\r\n",
      "term of conscious contact,--such as would make\r\n",
      "it much more difficult for the author to fall into\r\n",
      "the perversion and suppression of facts, than to\r\n",
      "set them down literally. It is very probable that\r\n",
      "her colours are a little too bright, and her shadows\r\n",
      "of too mild a gray, that the sky of her landscapes\r\n",
      "is too sunny, and their atmosphere too redolent of\r\n",
      "peace and abundance. Local affection may be accountable\r\n",
      "for half of this excess of brilliancy; the\r\n",

      "I do not remember, in all her novels, an instance\r\n",
      "of gross misery of any kind not directly\r\n",
      "caused by the folly of the sufferer. There are no\r\n",
      "pictures of vice or poverty or squalor. There are\r\n",
      "no rags, no gin, no brutal passions. That average\r\n",
      "humanity which she favours is very _borne_ in intellect,\r\n",

      "with avowedly no qualification for his profession,\r\n",

      "assuredly, has a right to claim dramatic pre-eminence.\r\n",
      "The one person for whom an approach to\r\n",
      "equality may be claimed is, not Adam Bede, but\r\n",
      "Arthur Donnithorne. If the story had ended, as\r\n",
      "I should have infinitely preferred to see it end,\r\n",

      "fatal to him. His sorrow at Hetty's misfortune\r\n",
      "is not a _sufficient_ sorrow for the situation. That\r\n",

      "to undertake, or even to conceive, in its\r\n",
      "completeness, a new tale, in which Adam, healed\r\n",
      "of his wound by time, should address himself to\r\n",

      "close of the tale which we are supposing to end\r\n",
      "with Hetty's death,--to make it the logical consequence\r\n",
      "of Adam's final state of mind. Of course\r\n",
      "circumstances would have much to do with bringing\r\n",
      "it to pass, and these circumstances could not\r\n",

      "reader at a stand-point to deduce for himself. In\r\n",
      "every novel the work is divided between the writer\r\n",

      "reader does quite half the labour. In making such\r\n",
      "a deduction as I have just indicated, the reader\r\n",
      "would be doing but his share of the task; the grand\r\n",
      "point is to get him to make it. I hold that there\r\n",
      "is a way. It is perhaps a secret; but until it is\r\n",

      "The part of the story which concerns her is\r\n",
      "much the most forcible; and there is something infinitely\r\n",
      "tragic in the reader's sense of the contrast\r\n",
      "between the sternly prosaic life of the good people\r\n",
      "about her, their wholesome decency and their noon-day\r\n",
      "probity, and the dusky sylvan path along which\r\n",
      "poor Hetty is tripping, light-footed, to her ruin.\r\n",
      "Hetty's conduct throughout seems to me to be\r\n",

      "young gentleman; but the author has in\r\n",
      "his case committed the error which in Hetty's she\r\n",
      "avoided,--the error of showing him as redeemed by\r\n",
      "suffering. I cannot but think that he was as weak\r\n",
      "as she. A weak woman, indeed, is weaker than a\r\n",
      "weak man; but Arthur Donnithorne was a superficial\r\n",
      "fellow, a person emphatically not to be moved\r\n",
      "by a shock of conscience into a really interesting\r\n",
      "and dignified attitude, such as he is made to assume\r\n",
      "at the close of the book. Why not see things\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It is as a picture, or rather as a series of pictures,\r\n",
      "that I find _Adam Bede_ most valuable. The\r\n",
      "author succeeds better in drawing attitudes of feeling\r\n",
      "than in drawing movements of feeling. Indeed,\r\n",
      "the only attempt at development of character\r\n",
      "or of purpose in the book occurs in the case of\r\n",
      "Arthur Donnithorne, where the materials are of\r\n",
      "the simplest kind. Hetty's lapse into disgrace is\r\n",
      "not gradual, it is immediate: it is without struggle\r\n",
      "and without passion. Adam himself has arrived\r\n",
      "at perfect righteousness when the book opens; and\r\n",
      "it is impossible to go beyond that. In his case too,\r\n",
      "therefore, there is no dramatic progression. The\r\n",
      "same remark applies to Dinah Morris.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not in her conceptions nor her composition\r\n",
      "that George Eliot is strongest: it is in her _touches_.\r\n",
      "In these she is quite original. She is a good deal\r\n",
      "of a humourist, and something of a satirist; but she\r\n",
      "is neither Dickens nor Thackeray. She has over\r\n",
      "them the great advantage that she is also a good\r\n",
      "deal of a philosopher; and it is to this union of\r\n",
      "the keenest observation with the ripest reflection,\r\n",
      "that her style owes its essential force. She is a\r\n",
      "thinker,--not, perhaps, a passionate thinker, but\r\n",
      "at least a serious one; and the term can be applied\r\n",
      "with either adjective neither to Dickens nor\r\n",
      "Thackeray. The constant play of lively and vigourous\r\n",
      "thought about the objects furnished by her\r\n",
      "observation animates these latter with a surprising\r\n",
      "richness of colour and a truly human interest. It\r\n",
      "gives to the author's style, moreover, that lingering,\r\n",
      "affectionate, comprehensive quality which\r\n",
      "is its chief distinction; and perhaps occasionally it\r\n",
      "makes her tedious. George Eliot is so little tedious,\r\n",
      "however, because, if, on the one hand, her reflection\r\n",
      "never flags, so, on the other, her observation never\r\n",
      "ceases to supply it with material. Her observation,\r\n",
      "I think, is decidedly of the feminine kind: it deals,\r\n",
      "in preference, with small things. This fact may\r\n",
      "be held to explain the excellence of what I have\r\n",
      "called her pictures, and the comparative feebleness\r\n",
      "of her dramatic movement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The contrast here indicated, strong in _Adam\r\n",
      "Bede_, is most striking in _Felix Holt, the Radical_.\r\n",
      "The latter work is an admirable tissue of details;\r\n",
      "but it seems to me quite without character as a\r\n",
      "composition. It leaves upon the mind no single\r\n",
      "impression. Felix Holt's radicalism, the pretended\r\n",
      "motive of the story, is utterly choked\r\n",
      "amidst a mass of subordinate interests. No representation\r\n",
      "is attempted of the growth of his opinions,\r\n",
      "or of their action upon his character; he is\r\n",
      "marked by the same singular rigidity of outline\r\n",
      "and fixedness of posture which characterized Adam\r\n",
      "Bede,--except, perhaps, that there is a certain inclination\r\n",
      "towards poetry in Holt's attitude. But\r\n",
      "if the general outline is timid and undecided in\r\n",
      "_Felix Holt_, the different parts are even richer than\r\n",
      "in former works. There is no person in the book\r\n",
      "who attains to triumphant vitality; but there is\r\n",
      "not a single figure, of however little importance,\r\n",
      "that has not caught from without a certain reflection\r\n",
      "of life. There is a little old waiting-woman\r\n",
      "to a great lady,--Mrs. Denner by name,--who does\r\n",
      "not occupy five pages in the story, but who leaves\r\n",

      "the story drags and halts,--the setting is too large\r\n",

      "time I read it, I declared to myself that much\r\n",

      "feeling and its elevated morality. I still recognize\r\n",
      "this latter fact, but I think I find it more on a\r\n",

      "A man has no associate so intimate as his own\r\n",
      "character, his own career,--his present and his past;\r\n",
      "and if he builds up his career of timid and base\r\n",
      "actions, they cling to him like evil companions,\r\n",

      "in Maggie Tulliver we had a picture of the elevation\r\n",

      "so that when the mind found itself face to face\r\n",
      "with the need for a strong muscular effort, it was\r\n",
      "competent to perform it; so in Tito we have a picture\r\n",
      "of that depression of the moral tone by falsity\r\n",
      "and self-indulgence, which gradually evokes on\r\n",
      "every side of the subject some implacable claim,\r\n",
      "to be avoided or propitiated. At last all his unpaid\r\n",

      "path of life a hideous blind alley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Can any argument be more plain? Can any\r\n",
      "lesson be more salutary? \"Under every guilty\r\n",

      "\"there is a hidden brood of guilty wishes, whose\r\n",
      "unwholesome, infecting life is cherished by the\r\n",
      "darkness. The contaminating effect of deeds often\r\n",
      "lies less in the commission than in the consequent\r\n",
      "adjustment of our desires,--the enlistment of self-interest\r\n",
      "on the side of falsity; as, on the other hand,\r\n",
      "the purifying influence of public confession springs\r\n",
      "from the fact, that by it the hope in lies is forever\r\n",
      "swept away, _and the soul recovers the noble attitude\r\n",
      "of simplicity_.\" And again: \"Tito was experiencing\r\n",
      "that inexorable law of human souls, that\r\n",
      "we prepare ourselves for sudden deeds by the reiterated\r\n",
      "choice of good or evil that gradually determines\r\n",

      "equality between the worth of _Romola_\r\n",
      "as a moral argument and its value as a work of\r\n",
      "art, is the fact that in each character it seems\r\n",
      "to me essentially prosaic. The excellence both of\r\n",
      "the spirit and of the execution of the book is emphatically\r\n",
      "an obvious excellence. They make no\r\n",
      "demand upon the imagination of the reader. It\r\n",
      "is true of both of them that he who runs may read\r\n",
      "them. It may excite surprise that I should intimate\r\n",
      "that George Eliot is deficient in imagination;\r\n",
      "but I believe that I am right in so doing. Very\r\n",
      "readable novels have been written without imagination;\r\n",
      "and as compared with writers who, like Mr.\r\n",
      "Trollope, are totally destitute of the faculty,\r\n",
      "George Eliot may be said to be richly endowed\r\n",
      "with it. But as compared with writers whom we\r\n",

      "must, in my opinion, content herself with the very\r\n",
      "solid distinction of being exclusively an observer.\r\n",
      "In confirmation of this I would suggest a comparison\r\n",
      "of those chapters in _Adam Bede_ which treat\r\n",
      "of Hetty's flight and wanderings, and those of\r\n",
      "Miss Bronte's _Jane Eyre_ which describe the heroine's\r\n",

      "One word more. Of all the impressions--and\r\n",
      "they are numerous--which a reperusal of George\r\n",

      "to be this: that (with all deference to _Felix Holt,\r\n",

      "most is the idea of a conscience harassed by the\r\n",
      "memory of slighted obligations. Unless in the case\r\n",
      "of Savonarola, she has made no attempt to depict\r\n",
      "a conscience taking upon itself great and novel\r\n",

      "every year for Mr. Browning's old friends to fight\r\n",
      "his battles for him, and many of them will feel that\r\n",

      "no need for criticism; there would be nothing in\r\n",
      "the way of matter to criticise, and old readers\r\n",
      "would have no heart to reproach. But it may be\r\n",

      "than thin, and he need claim none of the tenderness\r\n",
      "granted to those who have used themselves up\r\n",
      "in the service of their admirers. He is robust and\r\n",
      "vigorous; more so now, even, than heretofore, and\r\n",
      "he is more prolific than in the earlier part of his\r\n",
      "career. But his wantonness, his wilfulness, his\r\n",
      "crudity, his inexplicable want of secondary thought,\r\n",
      "as we may call it, of the stage of reflection that\r\n",
      "follows upon the first outburst of the idea, and\r\n",

      "common in Browning, that the talk of the women is even more rugged and\r\n",
      "insoluble than that of the men, is here greatly exaggerated. We are\r\n",

      "tolerably vivid image of his literary personality. His line is a\r\n",
      "definite one; his note is familiar, and we know what to expect from him.\r\n",
      "He was at pains, indeed, a year ago to quicken the apprehension of\r\n",
      "American readers by an effusion directed more or less explicitly to\r\n",
      "themselves. This piece of literature was brief, but it was very\r\n",
      "remarkable. Mr. Emerson had had occasion to speak of Mr. Swinburne with\r\n",
      "qualified admiration and this circumstance, coming to Mr. Swinburne's\r\n",
      "ears, had prompted him to uncork on the spot the vials of his wrath. He\r\n",
      "addressed to a newspaper a letter of which it is but a colourless\r\n",
      "account to say that it embodied the very hysterics of gross\r\n",
      "vituperation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Swinburne has some extremely just remarks about Byron's\r\n",
      "unamenableness to quotation, his having to be taken in the gross. This\r\n",
      "is almost equally true of our author himself; he must be judged by all\r\n",
      "he has done, and we must allow, in our judgment, the weight he would\r\n",
      "obviously claim for it to his elaborate tribute to the genius of Mr.\r\n",
      "Emerson. His tone has two distinct notes--the note of measureless praise\r\n",
      "and the note of furious denunciation. Each is in need of a correction,\r\n",
      "but we confess that, with all its faults, we prefer the former. That Mr.\r\n",
      "Swinburne has a kindness for his more restrictive strain is, however,\r\n",
      "very obvious. He is over-ready to sound it, and he is not particular\r\n",
      "about his pretext.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some people, he says, for instance, affirm that a writer may have a very\r\n",
      "effective style, yet have nothing of value to express with it. Mr.\r\n",
      "Swinburne demands that they prove their assertion. \"This flattering\r\n",
      "unction the very foolishest of malignants will hardly, in this case\r\n",
      "(that of Mr. D. G. Rossetti), be able to lay upon the corrosive sore\r\n",

      "responsible; for its adoption he is. A thousand years of purgatorial\r\n",
      "fire would be insufficient expiation for the criminal on whose deaf and\r\n",

      "old masters at Florence and the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1868. Mr.\r\n",
      "Swinburne, in writing of poets, cannot fail to say a great many\r\n",
      "felicitous things. His own insight into the poetic mystery is so deep,\r\n",
      "his perception in matters of language so refined, his power of\r\n",
      "appreciation so large and active, his imagination, especially, so\r\n",
      "sympathetic and flexible, that we constantly feel him to be one who has\r\n",
      "a valid right to judge and pass sentence. The variety of his sympathies\r\n",
      "in poetry is especially remarkable, and is in itself a pledge of\r\n",
      "criticism of a liberal kind. Victor Hugo is his divinity--a divinity\r\n",
      "whom indeed, to our sense, he effectually conceals and obliterates in\r\n",
      "the suffocating fumes of his rhetoric. On the other hand, one of the\r\n",
      "best papers in the volume is a disquisition on the poetry of Mr. Matthew\r\n",
      "Arnold, of which his relish seems hardly less intense and for whom he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Matthew Arnold's canons of style, we should have said, are a positive\r\n",
      "negation of those of Mr. Swinburne's, and it is to the credit of the\r\n",
      "latter's breadth of taste that he should have entered into an\r\n",
      "intellectual temperament which is so little his own. The other articles\r\n",
      "contain similar examples of his vivacity and energy of perception, and\r\n",
      "offer a number of happy judgments and suggestive observations. His\r\n",
      "estimate of Byron as a poet (not in the least as a man--on this point\r\n",
      "his utterances are consummately futile) is singularly discriminating;\r\n",
      "his measurement of Shelley's lyric force is eloquently adequate; his\r\n",
      "closing words upon John Ford are worth quoting as a specimen of strong\r\n",
      "apprehension and solid statement. Mr. Swinburne is by no means always\r\n",
      "solid, and this passage represents him at his best:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No poet is less forgettable than Ford; none fastens (as it were) the\r\n",

      "out again at pleasure; if he touch you once he takes you, and what he\r\n",
      "takes he keeps his hold of; his work becomes a part of your thought and\r\n",
      "parcel of your spiritual furniture for ever; he signs himself upon you\r\n",
      "as with a seal of deliberate and decisive power. His force is never the\r\n",
      "force of accident; the casual divinity of beauty which falls, as though\r\n",
      "direct from heaven, upon stray lines and phrases of some poets, fails\r\n",
      "never by any such heavenly chance on his; his strength of impulse is\r\n",
      "matched by his strength of will; he never works more by instinct than by\r\n",
      "resolution; he knows what he would have and what he will do, and gains\r\n",
      "his end and does his work with full conscience of purpose and insistence\r\n",
      "of design. By the might of a great will seconded by the force of a\r\n",
      "great hand he won the place he holds against all odds of rivalry in a\r\n",
      "race of rival giants.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the other hand, Mr. Swinburne is constantly liable on this same line\r\n",
      "to lapse into flagrant levity and perversity of taste; as in saying that\r\n",
      "he cannot consider Wordsworth \"as mere poet\" equal to Coleridge as mere\r\n",
      "poet; in speaking of Alfred de Musset as \"the female page or attendant\r\n",
      "dwarf\" of Byron, and his poems as \"decoctions of watered Byronism\"; or\r\n",
      "in alluding jauntily and _en passant_ to Gautier's _Mademoiselle de\r\n",
      "Maupin_ as \"the most perfect and exquisite book of modern times.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To note, however, the points at which Mr. Swinburne's judgment hits the\r\n",
      "mark, or the points at which it misses it, is comparatively superfluous,\r\n",
      "inasmuch as both of these cases seem to us essentially accidental. His\r\n",
      "book is not at all a book of judgment; it is a book of pure imagination.\r\n",
      "His genius is for style simply, and not in the least for thought nor for\r\n",
      "real analysis; he goes through the motions of criticism, and makes a\r\n",
      "considerable show of logic and philosophy, but with deep appreciation\r\n",
      "his writing seems to us to have very little to do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He is an imaginative commentator, often of a very splendid kind, but he\r\n",
      "is never a real interpreter and rarely a trustworthy guide. He is a\r\n",
      "writer, and a writer in constant quest of a theme. He has an inordinate\r\n",
      "sense of the picturesque, and he finds his theme in those subjects and\r\n",
      "those writers which gratify it. When they gratify it highly, he\r\n",
      "conceives a boundless relish for them; they give him his chance, and he\r\n",
      "turns-on the deluge of his exorbitant homage. His imagination kindles,\r\n",
      "he abounds in their own sense, when they give him an inch he takes an\r\n",
      "ell, and quite loses sight of the subject in the entertainment he finds\r\n",
      "in his own word-spinning. In this respect he is extraordinarily\r\n",
      "accomplished: he very narrowly misses having a magnificent style. On the\r\n",
      "imaginative side, his style is almost complete, and seems capable of\r\n",
      "doing everything that picturesqueness demands. There are few writers of\r\n",
      "our day who could have produced this description of a thunderstorm at\r\n",
      "sea. Mr. Swinburne gives it to us as the likeness of Victor Hugo's\r\n",
      "genius:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About midnight, the thundercloud was full overhead, full of incessant\r\n",
      "sound and fire, lightening and darkening so rapidly that it seemed to\r\n",
      "have life, and a delight in its life. At the same hour, the sky was\r\n",
      "clear to the west, and all along the sea-line there sprang and sank as\r\n",
      "to music a restless dance or chase of summer lightnings across the lower\r\n",
      "sky: a race and riot of lights, beautiful and rapid as a course of\r\n",
      "shining Oceanides along the tremulous floor of the sea. Eastward, at the\r\n",
      "same moment, the space of clear sky was higher and wider, a splendid\r\n",
      "semicircle of too intense purity to be called blue; it was of no colour\r\n",
      "nameable by man; and midway in it, between the stars and the sea, hung\r\n",
      "the motionless full moon; Artemis watching with serene splendour of\r\n",
      "scorn the battle of Titans and the revel of nymphs from her stainless\r\n",
      "and Olympian summit of divine indifferent light. Underneath and about\r\n",
      "us, the sea was paved with flame; the whole water trembled and hissed\r\n",
      "with phosphoric fire; even through the wind and thunder I could hear the\r\n",
      "crackling and sputtering of the water-sparks. In the same heaven and in\r\n",
      "the same hour there shone at once the three contrasted glories, golden\r\n",
      "and fiery and white, of moonlight, and of the double lightning, forked\r\n",
      "and sheet; and under all this miraculous heaven lay a flaming floor of\r\n",

      "commensurate development either of the reason or of the moral sense. One\r\n",
      "of these defects is, to our mind, fatal to Mr. Swinburne's style; the\r\n",
      "other is fatal to his tone, to his temper, to his critical pretensions.\r\n",
      "His style is without measure, without discretion, without sense of what\r\n",
      "to take and what to leave; after a few pages, it becomes intolerably\r\n",
      "fatiguing. It is always listening to itself--always turning its head\r\n",
      "over its shoulders to see its train flowing behind it. The train\r\n",
      "shimmers and tumbles in a very gorgeous fashion, but the rustle of its\r\n",
      "embroidery is fatally importunate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Swinburne is a dozen times too verbose; at least one-half of his\r\n",
      "phrases are what the French call phrases in the air. One-half of his\r\n",
      "sentence is always a repetition, for mere fancy's sake and nothing more,\r\n",
      "of the meaning of the other half--a play upon its words, an echo, a\r\n",
      "reflection, a duplication. This trick, of course, makes a writer\r\n",
      "formidably prolix. What we have called the absence of the moral sense of\r\n",
      "the writer of these essays is, however, their most disagreeable feature.\r\n",
      "By this we do not mean that Mr. Swinburne is not didactic, nor edifying,\r\n",
      "nor devoted to pleading the cause of virtue. We mean simply that his\r\n",
      "moral plummet does not sink at all, and that when he pretends to drop it\r\n",
      "he is simply dabbling in the relatively very shallow pool of the\r\n",
      "picturesque.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A sense of the picturesque so refined as Mr. Swinburne's will take one a\r\n",
      "great way, but it will by no means, in dealing with things whose great\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We do not remember in this whole volume a single instance of delicate\r\n",
      "moral discrimination--a single case in which the moral note has been\r\n",

      "In this poetical history of the fortunate--the unfortunate--Jason, Mr.\r\n",
      "Morris has written a book of real value. It is some time since we have\r\n",
      "met with a work of imagination of so thoroughly satisfactory a\r\n",
      "character,--a work read with an enjoyment so unalloyed and so untempered\r\n",
      "by the desire to protest and to criticise. The poetical firmament within\r\n",
      "these recent years has been all alive with unprophesied comets and\r\n",
      "meteors, many of them of extraordinary brilliancy, but most of them very\r\n",
      "rapid in their passage. Mr. Morris gives us the comfort of feeling that\r\n",
      "he is a fixed star, and that his radiance is not likely to be\r\n",
      "extinguished in a draught of wind,--after the fashion of Mr. Alexander\r\n",

      "speech from the pen of the author of the too famous _Poems and\r\n",
      "Ballads_,--a circumstance, we apprehend, in no small degree prejudicial\r\n",
      "to its success. But we hasten to assure all persons whom the knowledge\r\n",
      "of Mr. Swinburne's enthusiasm may have led to mistrust the character of\r\n",
      "the work, that it has to our perception nothing in common with this\r\n",
      "gentleman's own productions, and that his article proves very little\r\n",
      "more than that his sympathies are wiser than his performance. If Mr.\r\n",
      "Morris's poem may be said to remind us of the manner of any other\r\n",

      "_The Life and Death of Jason_, then, is a narrative poem on a Greek\r\n",
      "subject, written in a genuine English style. With the subject all\r\n",
      "reading people are familiar, and we have no need to retrace its details.\r\n",
      "But it is perhaps not amiss to transcribe the few pregnant lines of\r\n",
      "prose into which, at the outset, Mr. Morris has condensed the argument\r\n",
      "of his poem:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Jason the son of AEson, king of Iolchos, having come to man's estate,\r\n",
      "demanded of Pelias his father's kingdom, which he held wrongfully. But\r\n",
      "Pelias answered, that if he would bring from Colchis the golden fleece\r\n",
      "of the ram that had carried Phryxus thither, he would yield him his\r\n",
      "right. Whereon Jason sailed to Colchis in the ship Argo, with other\r\n",
      "heroes, and by means of Medea, the king's daughter, won the fleece; and\r\n",
      "carried off also Medea; and so, after many troubles, came back to\r\n",
      "Iolchos again. There, by Medea's wiles, was Pelias slain; but Jason went\r\n",
      "to Corinth, and lived with Medea happily, till he was taken with the\r\n",
      "love of Glauce, the king's daughter of Corinth, and must needs wed her;\r\n",
      "whom also Medea destroyed, and fled to AEgeus at Athens; and not long\r\n",
      "after Jason died strangely.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The style of this little fragment of prose is not an unapt measure of\r\n",
      "the author's poetical style,--quaint, but not too quaint, more\r\n",
      "Anglo-Saxon than Latin, and decidedly laconic. For in spite of the great\r\n",
      "length of his work, his manner is by no means diffuse. His story is a\r\n",
      "long one, and he wishes to do it justice; but the movement is rapid and\r\n",
      "business-like, and the poet is quite guiltless of any wanton lingering\r\n",
      "along the margin of the subject matter,--after the manner, for instance,\r\n",
      "of Keats,--to whom, individually, however, we make this tendency no\r\n",
      "reproach. Mr. Morris's subject is immensely rich,--heavy with its\r\n",
      "richness,--and in the highest degree romantic and poetical. For the most\r\n",
      "part, of course, he found not only the great _contours_, but the various\r\n",
      "incidents and episodes, ready drawn to his hand; but still there was\r\n",
      "enough wanting to make a most exhaustive drain upon his ingenuity and\r\n",
      "his imagination. And not only these faculties have been brought into\r\n",
      "severe exercise, but the strictest good taste and good sense were called\r\n",
      "into play, together with a certain final gift which we hardly know how\r\n",
      "to name, and which is by no means common, even among very clever\r\n",
      "poets,--a comprehensive sense of form, of proportion, and of real\r\n",
      "completeness, without which the most brilliant efforts of the\r\n",
      "imagination are a mere agglomeration of ill-reconciled beauties. The\r\n",
      "legend of Jason is full of strangely constructed marvels and elaborate\r\n",
      "prodigies and horrors, calculated to task heavily an author's\r\n",
      "adroitness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We have so pampered and petted our sense of the ludicrous of late years,\r\n",
      "that it is quite the spoiled child of the house, and without its leave\r\n",
      "no guest can be honourably entertained. It is very true that the\r\n",
      "atmosphere of Grecian mythology is so entirely an artificial one, that\r\n",
      "we are seldom tempted to refer its weird anomalous denizens to our\r\n",
      "standard of truth and beauty. Truth, indeed, is at once put out of the\r\n",
      "question; but one would say beforehand, that many of the creations of\r\n",
      "Greek fancy were wanting even in beauty, or at least in that ease and\r\n",
      "simplicity which has been acquired in modern times by force of culture.\r\n",
      "But habit and tradition have reconciled us to these things in their\r\n",
      "native forms, and Mr. Morris's skill reconciles us to them in his modern\r\n",
      "and composite English.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The idea, for instance, of a _flying ram_, seems, to an undisciplined\r\n",
      "fancy, a not especially happy creation, nor a very promising theme for\r\n",
      "poetry; but Mr. Morris, without diminishing its native oddity, has given\r\n",
      "it an ample romantic dignity. So, again, the sowing of the dragon's\r\n",
      "teeth at Colchis, and the springing up of mutually opposed armed men,\r\n",
      "seems too complex and recondite a scene to be vividly and gracefully\r\n",
      "realized; but as it stands, it is one of the finest passages in Mr.\r\n",
      "Morris's poem. His great stumbling-block, however, we take it, was the\r\n",
      "necessity of maintaining throughout the dignity and prominence of his\r\n",
      "hero. From the moment that Medea comes into the poem, Jason falls into\r\n",
      "the second place, and keeps it to the end. She is the all-wise and\r\n",
      "all-brave helper and counsellor at Colchis, and the guardian angel of\r\n",
      "the returning journey. She saves her companions from the Circean\r\n",
      "enchantments, and she withholds them from the embraces of the Sirens.\r\n",
      "She effects the death of Pelias, and assures the successful return of\r\n",
      "the Argonauts. And finally--as a last claim upon her interest--she is\r\n",
      "slighted and abandoned by the man of her love. Without question, then,\r\n",
      "she is the central figure of the poem,--a powerful and enchanting\r\n",
      "figure,--a creature of barbarous arts, and of exquisite human passions.\r\n",
      "Jason accordingly possesses only that indirect hold upon our attention\r\n",
      "which belongs to the Virgilian AEneas; although Mr. Morris has avoided\r\n",
      "Virgil's error of now and then allowing his hero to be contemptible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A large number, however, of far greater drawbacks than any we are able\r\n",
      "to mention could not materially diminish the powerful beauty of this\r\n",
      "fantastic legend. It is as rich in adventure as the Odyssey, and very\r\n",
      "much simpler. Its prime elements are of the most poetical and delightful\r\n",
      "kind. What can be more thrilling than the idea of a great boatful of\r\n",
      "warriors embarking upon dreadful seas, not for pleasure, nor for\r\n",
      "conquest, nor for any material advantage, but for the simple discovery\r\n",
      "of a jealously watched, magically guarded relic? There is in the\r\n",
      "character of the object of their quest something heroically\r\n",
      "unmarketable, or at least unavailable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But of course the story owes a vast deal to its episodes, and these have\r\n",
      "lost nothing in Mr. Morris's hands. One of the most beautiful--the well\r\n",
      "known adventure of Hylas--occurs at the very outset. The beautiful young\r\n",
      "man, during a halt of the ship, wanders inland through the forest, and,\r\n",
      "passing beside a sylvan stream, is espied and incontinently loved by the\r\n",
      "water nymphs, who forthwith \"detach\" one of their number to work his\r\n",
      "seduction. This young lady assumes the disguise and speech of a Northern\r\n",
      "princess, clad in furs, and in this character sings to her victim \"a\r\n",
      "sweet song, sung not yet to any man.\" Very sweet and truly lyrical it is\r\n",
      "like all the songs scattered through Mr. Morris's narrative. We are,\r\n",
      "indeed, almost in doubt whether the most beautiful passages in the poem\r\n",
      "do not occur in the series of songs in the fourteenth book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ship has already touched at the island of Circe, and the sailors,\r\n",
      "thanks to the earnest warnings of Medea, have abstained from setting\r\n",
      "foot on the fatal shore; while Medea has, in turn, been warned by the\r\n",
      "enchantress against the allurements of the Sirens. As soon as the ship\r\n",
      "draws nigh, these fair beings begin to utter their irresistible notes.\r\n",
      "All eyes are turned lovingly on the shore, the rowers' charmed muscles\r\n",
      "relax, and the ship drifts landward. But Medea exhorts and entreats her\r\n",
      "companions to preserve their course. Jason himself is not untouched, as\r\n",
      "Mr. Morris delicately tells us,--\"a moment Jason gazed.\" But Orpheus\r\n",
      "smites his lyre before it is too late, and stirs the languid blood of\r\n",
      "his comrades. The Sirens strike their harps amain, and a conflict of\r\n",
      "song arises. The Sirens sing of the cold, the glittering, the idle\r\n",
      "delights of their submarine homes; while Orpheus tells of the warm and\r\n",
      "pastoral landscapes of Greece. We have no space for quotation; of course\r\n",
      "Orpheus carries the day. But the finest and most delicate practical\r\n",
      "sense is shown in the alternation of the two lyrical arguments,--the\r\n",
      "soulless sweetness of the one, and the deep human richness of the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is throughout Mr. Morris's poem a great unity and evenness of\r\n",
      "excellence, which make selection and quotation difficult; but of\r\n",
      "impressive touches in our reading we noticed a very great number. We\r\n",
      "content ourselves with mentioning a single one. When Jason has sown his\r\n",
      "bag of dragon's teeth at Colchis, and the armed fighters have sprung up\r\n",
      "along the furrows, and under the spell contrived by Medea have torn each\r\n",
      "other to death:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"One man was left alive, but wounded sore,\r\n",
      "    Who, staring round about and seeing no more\r\n",
      "    His brothers' spears against him, fixed his eyes\r\n",
      "    Upon the queller of those mysteries.\r\n",
      "    Then dreadfully they gleamed, and with no word,\r\n",
      "    He tottered towards him with uplifted sword.\r\n",
      "    But scarce he made three paces down the field,\r\n",
      "    Ere chill death seized his heart, and on his shield\r\n",
      "    Clattering he fell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We have not spoken of Mr. Morris's versification nor of his vocabulary.\r\n",
      "We have only room to say that, to our perception, the first in its\r\n",
      "facility and harmony, and the second in its abundance and studied\r\n",
      "simplicity, leave nothing to be desired. There are of course faults and\r\n",
      "errors in his poem, but there are none that are not trivial and easily\r\n",
      "pardoned in the light of the fact that he has given us a work of\r\n",
      "consummate art and of genuine beauty. He has foraged in a\r\n",
      "treasure-house; he has visited the ancient world, and come back with a\r\n",
      "massive cup of living Greek wine. His project was no light task, but he\r\n",
      "has honourably fulfilled it. He has enriched the language with a\r\n",
      "narrative poem which we are sure that the public will not suffer to fall\r\n",
      "into the ranks of honoured but uncherished works,--objects of vague and\r\n",
      "sapient reference,--but will continue to read and to enjoy. In spite of\r\n",
      "its length, the interest of the story never flags, and as a work of art\r\n",
      "it never ceases to be pure. To the jaded intellects of the present\r\n",
      "moment, distracted with the strife of creeds and the conflict of\r\n",
      "theories, it opens a glimpse into a world where they will be called upon\r\n",
      "neither to choose, to criticise, nor to believe, but simply to feel, to\r\n",
      "look, and to listen.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This new volume of Mr. Morris is, we think, a book for all time; but it\r\n",
      "is especially a book for these ripening summer days. To sit in the open\r\n",
      "shade, inhaling the heated air, and, while you read these perfect fairy\r\n",
      "tales, these rich and pathetic human traditions to glance up from your\r\n",
      "page at the clouds and the trees, is to do as pleasant a thing as the\r\n",
      "heart of man can desire. Mr. Morris's book abounds in all the sounds and\r\n",
      "sights and sensations of nature, in the warmth of the sunshine, the\r\n",
      "murmur of forests, and the breath of ocean-scented breezes. The fullness\r\n",
      "of physical existence which belongs to climates where life is spent in\r\n",
      "the open air, is largely diffused through its pages:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      ... \"Hot July was drawing to an end,\r\n",
      "      And August came the fainting year to mend\r\n",
      "    With fruit and grain; so 'neath the trellises,\r\n",
      "      Nigh blossomless, did they lie well at ease,\r\n",
      "      And watched the poppies burn across the grass,\r\n",
      "    And o'er the bindweed's bells the brown bee pass,\r\n",
      "      Still murmuring of his gains: windless and bright\r\n",
      "      The morn had been, to help their dear delight.\r\n",
      "    ... Then a light wind arose\r\n",
      "      That shook the light stems of that flowery close,\r\n",
      "    And made men sigh for pleasure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is a random specimen. As you read, the fictitious universe of the\r\n",
      "poem seems to expand and advance out of its remoteness, to surge\r\n",
      "musically about your senses, and merge itself utterly in the universe\r\n",
      "which surrounds you. The summer brightness of the real world goes\r\n",
      "halfway to meet it; and the beautiful figures which throb with life in\r\n",
      "Mr. Morris's stories pass lightly to and fro between the realm of poetry\r\n",
      "and the mild atmosphere of fact. This quality was half the charm of the\r\n",
      "author's former poem, _The Life and Death of Jason_, published last\r\n",
      "summer. We seemed really to follow, beneath the changing sky, the\r\n",
      "fantastic boatload of wanderers in their circuit of the ancient world.\r\n",
      "For people compelled to stay at home, the perusal of the book in a\r\n",
      "couple of mornings was very nearly as good as a fortnight's holiday. The\r\n",
      "poem appeared to reflect so clearly and forcibly the poet's natural\r\n",
      "sympathies with the external world, and his joy in personal contact with\r\n",
      "it, that the reader obtained something very like a sense of physical\r\n",
      "transposition, without either physical or intellectual weariness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This ample and direct presentment of the joys of action and locomotion\r\n",
      "seems to us to impart to these two works a truly national and English\r\n",
      "tone. They taste not perhaps of the English soil, but of those strong\r\n",
      "English sensibilities which the great insular race carry with them\r\n",
      "through their wanderings, which they preserve and apply with such energy\r\n",
      "in every terrestrial clime, and which make them such incomparable\r\n",
      "travellers. We heartily recommend such persons as have a desire to\r\n",
      "accommodate their reading to the season--as are vexed with a delicate\r\n",

      "of the summer--to take this _Earthly Paradise_ with them to the country.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The book is a collection of tales in verse--found, without exception, we\r\n",
      "take it, rather than imagined, and linked together, somewhat loosely, by\r\n",
      "a narrative prologue. The following is the \"argument\" of the\r\n",
      "prologue--already often enough quoted, but pretty enough, in its\r\n",
      "ingenious prose, to quote again:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certain gentlemen and mariners of Norway, having considered all that\r\n",

      "many troubles and the lapse of many years, came old men to some western\r\n",
      "land, of which they had never before heard: there they died, when they\r\n",

      "considerable length, and of a beauty superior perhaps to that of the\r\n",
      "succeeding tales. An admirable romance of adventure has Mr. Morris\r\n",
      "unfolded in the melodious energy of this half-hurrying, half-lingering\r\n",

      "longing for transmarine mysteries, and to plunge boys themselves into a\r\n",
      "delicious agony of unrest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story is a tragedy, or very near it--as what story of the search for\r\n",
      "an Earthly Paradise could fail to be? Fate reserves for the poor\r\n",
      "storm-tossed adventurers a sort of fantastic compromise between their\r\n",
      "actual misery and their ideal bliss, whereby a kindly warmth is infused\r\n",
      "into the autumn of their days, and to the reader, at least, a very\r\n",
      "tolerable Earthly Paradise is laid open. The elders and civic worthies\r\n",

      "give us the stories rehearsed at the winter fireside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Greek stories are the various histories of Atalanta, of Perseus, of\r\n",
      "Cupid and Psyche, of Alcestis, of Atys, the hapless son of Croesus,\r\n",
      "and of Pygmalion. The companion pieces, which always serve excellently\r\n",
      "well to place in relief the perfect pagan character of their elder\r\n",
      "mates, deal of course with elements less generally known.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Atalanta's Race,\" the first of Mr. Morris's Greek legends, is to our\r\n",
      "mind almost the best. There is something wonderfully simple and\r\n",
      "childlike in the story, and the author has given it ample dignity, at\r\n",
      "the same time that he has preserved this quality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most vividly does he present the mild invincibility of his fleet-footed\r\n",
      "heroine and the half-boyish simplicity of her demeanour--a perfect model\r\n",
      "of a _belle inhumaine_. But the most beautiful passage in the poem is\r\n",
      "the description of the vigil of the love-sick Milanion in the lonely\r\n",
      "sea-side temple of Venus. The author has conveyed with exquisite art\r\n",
      "the sense of devout stillness and of pagan sanctity which invests this\r\n",
      "remote and prayerful spot. The yellow torch-light,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"Wherein with fluttering gown and half-bared limb\r\n",

      "the sound of the shallow flowing sea without, the young man's restless\r\n",
      "sleep on the pavement, besprinkled with the ocean spray, the apparition\r\n",
      "of the goddess with the early dawn, bearing the golden apple--all these\r\n",
      "delicate points are presented in the light of true poetry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The narrative of the adventures of Danae and of Perseus and Andromeda\r\n",
      "is, with the exception of the tale of Cupid and Psyche which follows it,\r\n",
      "the longest piece in the volume. Of the two, we think we prefer the\r\n",
      "latter. Unutterably touching is the career of the tender and helpless\r\n",
      "Psyche, and most impressive the terrible hostility of Venus. The author,\r\n",
      "we think, throughout manages this lady extremely well. She appears to us\r\n",
      "in a sort of rosy dimness, through which she looms as formidable as she\r\n",
      "is beautiful, and gazing with \"gentle eyes and unmoved smiles,\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"Such as in Cyprus, the fair blossomed isle,\r\n",
      "    When on the altar in the summer night\r\n",
      "    They pile the roses up for her delight,\r\n",
      "    Men see within their hearts.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The Love of Alcestis\" is the beautiful story of the excellent wife who,\r\n",
      "when her husband was ill, gave up her life, so that he might recover and\r\n",
      "live for ever. Half the interest here, however, lies in the servitude of\r\n",
      "Apollo in disguise, and in the touching picture of the radiant god doing\r\n",
      "in perfection the homely work of his office, and yet from time to time\r\n",
      "emitting flashes, as it were, of genius and deity, while the good\r\n",
      "Admetus observes him half in kindness and half in awe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of the \"Son of Croesus,\" the poor young man who is slain by\r\n",
      "his best friend because the gods had foredoomed it, is simple, pathetic,\r\n",
      "and brief. The finest and sweetest poem in the volume, to our taste, is\r\n",
      "the tale of \"Pygmalion and the Image.\" The merit of execution is perhaps\r\n",
      "not appreciably greater here than in the other pieces, but the legend is\r\n",
      "so unutterably charming that it claims precedence of its companions. As\r\n",
      "beautiful as anything in all our later poetry, we think, is the\r\n",
      "description of the growth and dominance in the poor sculptor's heart of\r\n",
      "his marvellous passion for the stony daughter of his hands. Borne along\r\n",
      "on the steady, changing flow of his large and limpid verse, the author\r\n",
      "glides into the situation with an ease and grace and fullness of\r\n",
      "sympathy worthy of a great master. Here, as elsewhere, there is no sign\r\n",
      "of effort or of strain. In spite of the studied and _recherche_\r\n",
      "character of his diction, there is not a symptom of affectation in\r\n",
      "thought or speech. We seem in this tale of \"Pygmalion\" truly to inhabit\r\n",
      "the bright and silent workroom of a great Greek artist, and, standing\r\n",
      "among shapes and forms of perfect beauty, to breathe the incense-tainted\r\n",
      "air in which lovely statues were conceived and shining stones chiselled\r\n",
      "into immortality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Morris is indubitably a sensuous poet, to his credit be it said; his\r\n",
      "senses are constantly proffering their testimony and crying out their\r\n",
      "delight. But while they take their freedom, they employ it in no degree\r\n",
      "to their own debasement. Just as there is modesty of temperament we\r\n",
      "conceive there is modesty of imagination, and Mr. Morris possesses the\r\n",
      "latter distinction. The total absence of it is, doubtless, the long and\r\n",
      "short of Mr. Swinburne's various troubles. We may imagine Mr. Swinburne\r\n",
      "making a very clever poem of this story of \"Pygmalion,\" but we cannot\r\n",
      "fancy him making it anything less than utterly disagreeable. The\r\n",
      "thoroughly agreeable way in which Mr. Morris tells it is what especially\r\n",
      "strikes us. We feel that his imagination is equally fearless and\r\n",
      "irreproachable, and that while he tells us what we may call a sensuous\r\n",
      "story in all its breadth, he likewise tells it in all its purity. It\r\n",
      "has, doubtless, an impure side; but of the two he prefers the other.\r\n",
      "While Pygmalion is all aglow with his unanswered passion, he one day\r\n",
      "sits down before his image:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"And at the last drew forth a book of rhymes,\r\n",
      "    Wherein were writ the tales of many climes,\r\n",

      "    Of lovers' sorrows and their tangled sin.\"\r\n",

      "these romantic modern stories the same easy power is revealed, the same\r\n",
      "admirable union of natural gifts and cultivated perceptions. Mr. Morris\r\n",
      "is evidently a poet in the broad sense of the word--a singer of human\r\n",
      "joys and sorrows, whenever and wherever found. His somewhat artificial\r\n",
      "diction, which would seem to militate against our claim that his genius\r\n",
      "is of the general and comprehensive order, is, we imagine, simply an\r\n",
      "achievement of his own. It is not imposed from without, but developed\r\n",
      "from within. Whatever may be said of it, it certainly will not be\r\n",

      "and irregularity, an adaptability to the movements of the author's mind,\r\n",
      "which make it an ample vehicle of poetical utterance. He says in this\r\n",
      "language of his own the most various and the most truthful things; he\r\n",
      "moves, melts, and delights. Such at least, is our own experience. Other\r\n",
      "persons, we know, find it difficult to take him entirely _au serieux_.\r\n",
      "But we, taking him--and our critical duties too--in the most serious\r\n",
      "manner our mind permits of, feel strongly impelled, both by gratitude\r\n",
      "and by reflection, to pronounce him a noble and delightful poet. To call\r\n",
      "a man healthy nowadays is almost an insult--invalids learn so many\r\n",
      "secrets. But the health of the intellect is often promoted by physical\r\n",
      "disability. We say therefore, finally, that however the faculty may have\r\n",
      "been promoted--with the minimum of suffering, we certainly hope--Mr.\r\n",
      "Morris is a supremely healthy writer. This poem is marked by all that is\r\n",

      "     A review of _Essays in Criticism_. By Matthew Arnold, Professor of\r\n",
      "     Poetry in the University of Oxford. Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n",
      "     1865. Originally published in _North American Review_, July, 1865.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "MATTHEW ARNOLD'S ESSAYS\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Arnold's _Essays in Criticism_ come to American readers with a\r\n",
      "reputation already made,--the reputation of a charming style, a great\r\n",
      "deal of excellent feeling, and an almost equal amount of questionable\r\n",
      "reasoning. It is for us either to confirm the verdict passed in the\r\n",
      "author's own country, or to judge his work afresh. It is often the\r\n",
      "fortune of English writers to find mitigation of sentence in the United\r\n",
      "States.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Essays contained in this volume are on purely literary subjects;\r\n",
      "which is for us, by itself, a strong recommendation. English literature,\r\n",
      "especially contemporary literature, is, compared with that of France and\r\n",
      "Germany, very poor in collections of this sort. A great deal of\r\n",
      "criticism is written, but little of it is kept; little of it is deemed\r\n",
      "to contain any permanent application. Mr. Arnold will doubtless find in\r\n",
      "this fact--if indeed he has not already signalized it--but another proof\r\n",
      "of the inferiority of the English to the Continental school of\r\n",
      "criticism, and point to it as a baleful effect of the narrow practical\r\n",
      "spirit which animates, or, as he would probably say, paralyzes, the\r\n",
      "former. But not only is his book attractive as a whole, from its\r\n",
      "exclusively literary character; the subject of each essay is moreover\r\n",
      "particularly interesting. The first paper is on the function of\r\n",
      "Criticism at the present time; a question, if not more important,\r\n",
      "perhaps more directly pertinent here than in England. The second,\r\n",
      "discussing the literary influence of Academies, contains a great deal of\r\n",
      "valuable observation and reflection in a small compass and under an\r\n",
      "inadequate title. The other essays are upon the two De Guerins, Heinrich\r\n",
      "Heine, Pagan and Mediaeval Religious Sentiment, Joubert, Spinoza, and\r\n",
      "Marcus Aurelius. The first two articles are, to our mind, much the best;\r\n",
      "the next in order of excellence is the paper on Joubert; while the\r\n",
      "others, with the exception, perhaps, of that on Spinoza, are of about\r\n",
      "equal merit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Arnold's style has been praised at once too much and too little. Its\r\n",
      "resources are decidedly limited; but if the word had not become so\r\n",
      "cheap, we should nevertheless call it fascinating. This quality implies\r\n",
      "no especial force; it rests in this case on the fact that, whether or\r\n",
      "not you agree with the matter beneath it, the manner inspires you with a\r\n",
      "personal affection for the author. It expresses great sensibility, and\r\n",
      "at the same time great good-nature; it indicates a mind both susceptible\r\n",
      "and healthy. With the former element alone it would savour of\r\n",
      "affectation; with the latter, it would be coarse. As it stands, it\r\n",
      "represents a spirit both sensitive and generous. We can best describe\r\n",
      "it, perhaps, by the word sympathetic. It exhibits frankly, and without\r\n",
      "detriment to its national character, a decided French influence. Mr.\r\n",
      "Arnold is too wise to attempt to write French English; he probably knows\r\n",
      "that a language can only be indirectly enriched; but as nationality is\r\n",
      "eminently a matter of form, he knows too that he can really violate\r\n",
      "nothing so long as he adheres to the English letter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His Preface is a striking example of the intelligent amiability which\r\n",
      "animates his style. His two leading Essays were, on their first\r\n",
      "appearance, made the subject of much violent contention, their moral\r\n",
      "being deemed little else than a wholesale schooling of the English press\r\n",
      "by the French programme. Nothing could have better proved the justice of\r\n",
      "Mr. Arnold's remarks upon the \"provincial\" character of the English\r\n",
      "critical method than the reception which they provoked. He now\r\n",
      "acknowledges this reception in a short introduction, which admirably\r\n",
      "reconciles smoothness of temper with sharpness of wit. The taste of this\r\n",
      "performance has been questioned; but wherever it may err, it is\r\n",
      "assuredly not in being provincial; it is essentially civil. Mr. Arnold's\r\n",
      "amiability is, in our eye, a strong proof of his wisdom. If he were a\r\n",
      "few degrees more short-sighted, he might have less equanimity at his\r\n",
      "command. Those who sympathise with him warmly will probably like him\r\n",
      "best as he is; but with such as are only half his friends, this freedom\r\n",
      "from party passion, from what is after all but a lawful professional\r\n",
      "emotion, will argue against his sincerity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For ourselves, we doubt not that Mr. Arnold possesses thoroughly what\r\n",
      "the French call the courage of his opinions. When you lay down a\r\n",
      "proposition which is forthwith controverted, it is of course optional\r\n",
      "with you to take up the cudgels in its defence. If you are deeply\r\n",
      "convinced of its truth, you will perhaps be content to leave it to take\r\n",
      "care of itself; or, at all events, you will not go out of your way to\r\n",
      "push its fortunes; for you will reflect that in the long run an opinion\r\n",
      "often borrows credit from the forbearance of its patrons. In the long\r\n",
      "run, we say; it will meanwhile cost you an occasional pang to see your\r\n",
      "cherished theory turned into a football by the critics. A football is\r\n",
      "not, as such, a very respectable object, and the more numerous the\r\n",
      "players, the more ridiculous it becomes. Unless, therefore, you are very\r\n",
      "confident of your ability to rescue it from the chaos of kicks, you will\r\n",
      "best consult its interests by not mingling in the game. Such has been\r\n",
      "Mr. Arnold's choice. His opponents say that he is too much of a poet to\r\n",
      "be a critic; he is certainly too much of a poet to be a disputant. In\r\n",
      "the Preface in question he has abstained from reiterating any of the\r\n",
      "views put forth in the two offensive Essays; he has simply taken a\r\n",
      "delicate literary vengeance upon his adversaries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For Mr. Arnold's critical feeling and observation, used independently of\r\n",
      "his judgment, we profess a keen relish. He has these qualities, at any\r\n",
      "rate, of a good critic, whether or not he have the others,--the science\r\n",
      "and the logic. It is hard to say whether the literary critic is more\r\n",
      "called upon to understand or to feel. It is certain that he will\r\n",
      "accomplish little unless he can feel acutely; although it is perhaps\r\n",
      "equally certain that he will become weak the moment that he begins to\r\n",
      "\"work,\" as we may say, his natural sensibilities. The best critic is\r\n",
      "probably he who leaves his feelings out of account, and relies upon\r\n",
      "reason for success. If he actually possesses delicacy of feeling, his\r\n",
      "work will be delicate without detriment to its solidity. The complaint\r\n",
      "of Mr. Arnold's critics is that his arguments are too sentimental.\r\n",
      "Whether this complaint is well founded, we shall hereafter inquire; let\r\n",
      "us determine first what sentiment has done for him. It has given him, in\r\n",
      "our opinion, his greatest charm and his greatest worth. Hundreds of\r\n",
      "other critics have stronger heads; few, in England at least, have more\r\n",
      "delicate perceptions. We regret that we have not the space to confirm\r\n",
      "this assertion by extracts. We must refer the reader to the book\r\n",
      "itself, where he will find on every page an illustration of our meaning.\r\n",
      "He will find one, first of all, in the apostrophe to the University of\r\n",
      "Oxford, at the close of the Preface,--\"home of lost causes and forsaken\r\n",
      "beliefs and unpopular names and impossible loyalties.\" This is doubtless\r\n",
      "nothing but sentiment, but it seizes a shade of truth, and conveys it\r\n",
      "with a directness which is not at the command of logical demonstration.\r\n",
      "Such a process might readily prove, with the aid of a host of facts,\r\n",
      "that the University is actually the abode of much retarding\r\n",
      "conservatism; a fine critical instinct alone, and the measure of\r\n",
      "audacity which accompanies such an instinct, could succeed in placing\r\n",
      "her on the side of progress by boldly saluting her as the Queen of\r\n",
      "Romance: romance being the deadly enemy of the commonplace; the\r\n",
      "commonplace being the fast ally of Philistinism, and Philistinism the\r\n",
      "heaviest drag upon the march of civilisation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Arnold is very fond of quoting Goethe's eulogy upon Schiller, to the\r\n",
      "effect that his friend's greatest glory was to have left so far behind\r\n",
      "him _was uns alle baendigt, das Gemeine_, that bane of mankind, the\r\n",
      "common. Exactly how much the inscrutable Goethe made of this fact, it is\r\n",
      "hard at this day to determine; but it will seem to many readers that Mr.\r\n",
      "Arnold makes too much of it. Perhaps he does, for himself; but for the\r\n",
      "public in general he decidedly does not. One of the chief duties of\r\n",
      "criticism is to exalt the importance of the ideal; and Goethe's speech\r\n",
      "has a long career in prospect before we can say with the vulgar that it\r\n",
      "is \"played out.\" Its repeated occurrence in Mr. Arnold's pages is but\r\n",
      "another instance of poetic feeling subserving the ends of criticism.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The famous comment upon the girl Wragg, over which the author's\r\n",
      "opponents made so merry, we likewise owe--we do not hesitate to declare\r\n",
      "it--to this same poetic feeling. Why cast discredit upon so valuable an\r\n",
      "instrument of truth? Why not wait at least until it is used in the\r\n",
      "service of error? The worst that can be said of the paragraph in\r\n",
      "question is, that it is a great ado about nothing. All thanks, say we,\r\n",
      "to the critic who will pick up such nothings as these; for if he\r\n",
      "neglects them, they are blindly trodden under foot. They may not be\r\n",
      "especially valuable, but they are for that very reason the critic's\r\n",
      "particular care. Great truths take care of themselves; great truths are\r\n",
      "carried aloft by philosophers and poets; the critic deals in\r\n",
      "contributions to truth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another illustration of the nicety of Mr. Arnold's feeling is furnished\r\n",
      "by his remarks upon the quality of _distinction_ as exhibited in Maurice\r\n",
      "and Eugenie de Guerin, \"that quality which at last inexorably corrects\r\n",
      "the world's blunders and fixes the world's ideals, [which] procures that\r\n",
      "the popular poet shall not pass for a Pindar, the popular historian for\r\n",
      "a Tacitus, nor the popular preacher for a Bossuet.\" Another is offered\r\n",
      "by his incidental remarks upon Coleridge, in the article on Joubert;\r\n",
      "another, by the remarkable felicity with which he has translated Maurice\r\n",
      "de Guerin's _Centaur_; and another, by the whole body of citations with\r\n",
      "which, in his second Essay, he fortifies his proposition that the\r\n",
      "establishment in England of an authority answering to the French Academy\r\n",
      "would have arrested certain evil tendencies of English literature,--for\r\n",
      "to nothing more offensive than this, as far as we can see, does this\r\n",
      "argument amount.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the first and most important of his Essays Mr. Arnold puts forth his\r\n",
      "views upon the actual duty of criticism. They may be summed up as\r\n",
      "follows. Criticism has no concern with the practical; its function is\r\n",
      "simply to get at the best thought which is current,--to see things in\r\n",
      "themselves as they are,--to be disinterested. Criticism can be\r\n",
      "disinterested, says Mr. Arnold,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     \"by keeping from practice; by resolutely following the law of its\r\n",
      "     own nature, which is to be a free play of the mind on all subjects\r\n",
      "     which it touches, by steadily refusing to lend itself to any of\r\n",
      "     those ulterior political, practical considerations about ideas\r\n",

      "_Philistine_. The term is of German origin, and has no English synonyme.\r\n",
      "\"At Soli,\" remarks Mr. Arnold, \"I imagined they did not talk of\r\n",
      "solecisms; and here, at the very head-quarters of Goliath, nobody talks\r\n",
      "of Philistinism.\" The word _epicier_, used by Mr. Arnold as a French\r\n",
      "synonyme, is not so good as _bourgeois_, and to those who know that\r\n",
      "_bourgeois_ means a citizen, and who reflect that a citizen is a person\r\n",
      "seriously interested in the maintenance of order, the German term may\r\n",
      "now assume a more special significance. An English review briefly\r\n",
      "defines it by saying that \"it applies to the fat-headed respectable\r\n",
      "public in general.\" This definition must satisfy us here. The Philistine\r\n",
      "portion of the English press, by which we mean the considerably larger\r\n",
      "portion, received Mr. Arnold's novel programme of criticism with the\r\n",
      "uncompromising disapprobation which was to be expected from a literary\r\n",
      "body, the principle of whose influence, or indeed of whose being is its\r\n",
      "subservience, through its various members, to certain political and\r\n",
      "religious interests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Arnold's general theory was offensive enough; but the conclusions\r\n",
      "drawn by him from the fact that English practice has been so long and so\r\n",
      "directly at variance with it, were such as to excite the strongest\r\n",
      "animosity. Chief among these was the conclusion that this fact has\r\n",
      "retarded the development and vulgarised the character of the English\r\n",
      "mind, as compared with the French and the German mind. This rational\r\n",
      "inference may be nothing but a poet's flight; but for ourselves, we\r\n",
      "assent to it. It reaches us too. The facts collected by Mr. Arnold on\r\n",
      "this point have long wanted a voice. It has long seemed to us that, as a\r\n",
      "nation, the English are singularly incapable of large, of high, of\r\n",
      "general views. They are indifferent to pure truth, to _la verite vraie_.\r\n",
      "Their views are almost exclusively practical, and it is in the nature of\r\n",
      "practical views to be narrow. They seldom indeed admit a fact but on\r\n",
      "compulsion; they demand of an idea some better recommendation, some\r\n",
      "longer pedigree, than that it is true. That this lack of spontaneity in\r\n",
      "the English intellect is caused by the tendency of English criticism, or\r\n",
      "that it is to be corrected by a diversion, or even by a complete\r\n",
      "reversion, of this tendency, neither Mr. Arnold nor ourselves suppose,\r\n",
      "nor do we look upon such a result as desirable. The part which Mr.\r\n",
      "Arnold assigns to his reformed method of criticism is a purely tributary\r\n",
      "part. Its indirect result will be to quicken the naturally irrational\r\n",
      "action of the English mind; its direct result will be to furnish that\r\n",
      "mind with a larger stock of ideas than it has enjoyed under the\r\n",
      "time-honoured _regime_ of Whig and Tory, High-Church and Low-Church\r\n",
      "organs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We may here remark, that Mr. Arnold's statement of his principles is\r\n",
      "open to some misinterpretation,--an accident against which he has,\r\n",
      "perhaps, not sufficiently guarded it. For many persons the word\r\n",
      "_practical_ is almost identical with the word _useful_, against which,\r\n",
      "on the other hand, they erect the word _ornamental_. Persons who are\r\n",
      "fond of regarding these two terms as irreconcilable, will have little\r\n",
      "patience with Mr. Arnold's scheme of criticism. They will look upon it\r\n",
      "as an organised preference of unprofitable speculation to common sense.\r\n",
      "But the great beauty of the critical movement advocated by Mr. Arnold is\r\n",
      "that in either direction its range of action is unlimited. It deals with\r\n",
      "plain facts as well as with the most exalted fancies; but it deals with\r\n",
      "them only for the sake of the truth which is in them, and not for _your_\r\n",
      "sake, reader, and that of your party. It takes _high ground_, which is\r\n",
      "the ground of theory. It does not busy itself with consequences, which\r\n",
      "are all in all to you. Do not suppose that it for this reason pretends\r\n",
      "to ignore or to undervalue consequences; on the contrary, it is because\r\n",
      "it knows that consequences are inevitable that it leaves them alone. It\r\n",
      "cannot do two things at once; it cannot serve two masters. Its business\r\n",
      "is to make truth generally accessible, and not to apply it. It is only\r\n",
      "on condition of having its hands free, that it can make truth generally\r\n",
      "accessible. We said just now that its duty was, among other things, to\r\n",
      "exalt, if possible, the importance of the ideal. We should perhaps have\r\n",
      "said the intellectual; that is, of the principle of understanding\r\n",
      "things. Its business is to urge the claims of all things to be\r\n",
      "understood. If this is its function in England, as Mr. Arnold\r\n",
      "represents, it seems to us that it is doubly its function in this\r\n",
      "country. Here is no lack of votaries of the practical, of\r\n",
      "experimentalists, of empirics. The tendencies of our civilisation are\r\n",
      "certainly not such as foster a preponderance of morbid speculation. Our\r\n",
      "national genius inclines yearly more and more to resolve itself into a\r\n",
      "vast machine for sifting, in all things, the wheat from the chaff.\r\n",
      "American society is so shrewd, that we may safely allow it to make\r\n",
      "application of the truths of the study. Only let us keep it supplied\r\n",
      "with the truths of the study, and not with the half-truths of the forum.\r\n",
      "Let criticism take the stream of truth at its source, and then practice\r\n",
      "can take it half-way down. When criticism takes it half-way down,\r\n",
      "practice will come poorly off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If we have not touched upon the faults of Mr. Arnold's volume, it is\r\n",
      "because they are faults of detail, and because, when, as a whole, a book\r\n",
      "commands our assent, we do not incline to quarrel with its parts. Some\r\n",
      "of the parts in these Essays are weak, others are strong; but the\r\n",
      "impression which they all combine to leave is one of such beauty as to\r\n",
      "make us forget, not only their particular faults, but their particular\r\n",
      "merits. If we were asked what is the particular merit of a given essay,\r\n",
      "we should reply that it is a merit much less common at the present day\r\n",
      "than is generally supposed,--the merit which pre-eminently characterises\r\n",
      "Mr. Arnold's poems, the merit, namely, of having a _subject_. Each essay\r\n",
      "is _about_ something. If a literary work now-a-days start with a certain\r\n",
      "topic, that is all that is required of it; and yet it is a work of art\r\n",
      "only on condition of ending with that topic, on condition of being\r\n",
      "written, not from it, but to it. If the average modern essay or poem\r\n",
      "were to wear its title at the close, and not at the beginning, we wonder\r\n",
      "in how many cases the reader would fail to be surprised by it. A book\r\n",
      "or an article is looked upon as a kind of Staubbach waterfall,\r\n",
      "discharging itself into infinite space.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If we were questioned as to the merit of Mr. Arnold's book as a whole,\r\n",
      "we should say that it lay in the fact that the author takes high ground.\r\n",
      "The manner of his Essays is a model of what criticisms should be. The\r\n",
      "foremost English critical journal, the Saturday Review, recently\r\n",
      "disposed of a famous writer by saying, in a parenthesis, that he had\r\n",
      "done nothing but write nonsense all his life. Mr. Arnold does not pass\r\n",
      "judgment in parenthesis. He is too much of an artist to use leading\r\n",
      "propositions for merely literary purposes. The consequence is, that he\r\n",
      "says a few things in such a way as that almost in spite of ourselves we\r\n",
      "remember them, instead of a number of things which we cannot for the\r\n",
      "life of us remember. There are many things which we wish he had said\r\n",
      "better. It is to be regretted, for instance, that, when Heine is for\r\n",
      "once in a way seriously spoken of, he should not be spoken of more as\r\n",
      "the great poet which he is, and which even in New England he will one\r\n",
      "day be admitted to be, than with reference to the great moralist which\r\n",
      "he is not, and which he never claimed to be. But here, as in other\r\n",
      "places, Mr. Arnold's excellent spirit reconciles us with his\r\n",
      "shortcomings. If he has not spoken of Heine exhaustively, he has at all\r\n",
      "events spoken of him seriously, which for an Englishman is a good deal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Arnold's supreme virtue is that he speaks of all things seriously,\r\n",
      "or, in other words, that he is not offensively clever. The writers who\r\n",
      "are willing to resign themselves to this obscure distinction are in our\r\n",
      "opinion the only writers who understand their time. That Mr. Arnold\r\n",
      "thoroughly understands his time we do not mean to say, for this is the\r\n",
      "privilege of a very select few; but he is, at any rate, profoundly\r\n",
      "conscious of his time. This fact was clearly apparent in his poems, and\r\n",
      "it is even more apparent in these Essays. It gives them a peculiar\r\n",
      "character of melancholy,--that melancholy which arises from the\r\n",
      "spectacle of the old-fashioned instinct of enthusiasm in conflict (or at\r\n",
      "all events in contact) with the modern desire to be fair,--the\r\n",
      "melancholy of an age which not only has lost its _naivete_, but which\r\n",

      "and sufferings of our soldiers, and of admiration for our national\r\n",
      "energy, together with a ready command of picturesque language, are\r\n",
      "sufficient inspiration for a poet. If this were the case, we had been a\r\n",
      "nation of poets. The constant developments of the war moved us\r\n",

      "incidentally masters, grasps, and uses the superficial traits of his\r\n",
      "theme, is really a poet only in so far as he extracts its latent meaning\r\n",

      "style, I have been very near preferring the author of _Silas Marner_ and\r\n",

      "her unexpected assumption of the poetical function, I find it hard at\r\n",
      "times not to mistrust my impression. I like George Eliot well enough, in\r\n",
      "fact, to admit, for the time, that I might have been in the wrong. If I\r\n",
      "had liked her less, if I had rated lower the quality of her prose, I\r\n",

      "carpenters and weavers and millers' daughters no legitimate subject for\r\n",

      "work ceases to be a novelty, objections, exceptions, and protests\r\n",
      "multiply. This is quite logical. Not only does it take a much longer\r\n",
      "time than the reviewer on a weekly journal has at his command to\r\n",
      "properly appreciate a work of the importance of _The Spanish Gypsy_, but\r\n",

      "dazzling new half to the old one, readers constructed for the moment a\r\n",
      "really splendid literary figure. But gradually the old half began to\r\n",
      "absorb the new, and to assimilate its virtues and failings, and critics\r\n",
      "finally remembered that the cleverest writer in the world is after all\r\n",
      "nothing and no one but himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The most striking quality in _The Spanish Gypsy_, on a first reading, I\r\n",
      "think, is its extraordinary rhetorical energy and elegance. The richness\r\n",
      "of the author's style in her novels gives but an inadequate idea of the\r\n",
      "splendid generosity of diction displayed in the poem. She is so much of\r\n",
      "a thinker and an observer that she draws very heavily on her powers of\r\n",
      "expression, and one may certainly say that they not only never fail her,\r\n",
      "but that verbal utterance almost always bestows upon her ideas a\r\n",
      "peculiar beauty and fullness, apart from their significance. The result\r\n",
      "produced in this manner, the reader will see, may come very near being\r\n",
      "poetry; it is assuredly eloquence. The faults in the present work are\r\n",
      "very seldom faults of weakness, except in so far as it is weak to lack\r\n",
      "an absolute mastery of one's powers; they arise rather from an excess of\r\n",
      "rhetorical energy, from a desire to attain to perfect fullness and\r\n",
      "roundness of utterance; they are faults of overstatement. It is by no\r\n",
      "means uncommon to find a really fine passage injured by the addition of\r\n",
      "a clause which dilutes the idea under pretence of completing it. The\r\n",

      "criticising _The Spanish Gypsy_ we must not cease to bear in mind, the\r\n",
      "fact that the work is emphatically a _romance_. We may contest its being\r\n",
      "a poem, but we must admit that it is a romance in the fullest sense of\r\n",
      "the word. Whether the term may be absolutely defined I know not; but we\r\n",
      "may say of it, comparing it with the novel, that it carries much farther\r\n",
      "that compromise with reality which is the basis of all imaginative\r\n",
      "writing. In the romance this principle of compromise pervades the\r\n",
      "superstructure as well as the basis. The most that we exact is that the\r\n",

      "conviction is strong in the reader's mind that a genuine Spanish Zincala\r\n",

      "of a strong mental desire for creatures well rounded in their elevation\r\n",
      "and heroism,--creatures who should illustrate the nobleness of human\r\n",
      "nature divorced from its smallness. Don Silva has decidedly more of the\r\n",
      "common stuff of human feeling, more charming natural passion and\r\n",

      "actual or possible fact,--that the action goes on in an artificial\r\n",

      "noble_ in perfection. His speeches have an exquisite eloquence. In\r\n",
      "strictness, he is to the last degree unreal, illogical, and rhetorical;\r\n",
      "but a certain dramatic unity is diffused through his character by the\r\n",
      "depth and energy of the colours in which he is painted. With a little\r\n",

      "exhibits a perfect aristocratic nature (born and bred at a time when\r\n",
      "democratic aspirations were quite irrelevant to happiness), dragged down\r\n",
      "by no fault of its own into the vulgar mire of error and expiation. The\r\n",
      "interest which attaches to Don Silva's character revolves about its\r\n",
      "exquisite human weakness, its manly scepticism, its antipathy to the\r\n",
      "trenchant, the absolute, and arbitrary. At the opening of the book, the\r\n",

      "that should have been, has evaporated. Wrayburn lounges about with his\r\n",

      "the surface of things. If we might hazard a definition of his literary\r\n",
      "character, we should, accordingly, call him the greatest of superficial\r\n",

      "against humanity to place Mr. Dickens among the greatest novelists. For,\r\n",
      "to repeat what we have already intimated, he has created nothing but\r\n",
      "figure. He has added nothing to our understanding of human character. He\r\n",
      "is master of but two alternatives: he reconciles us to what is\r\n",
      "commonplace, and he reconciles us to what is odd. The value of the\r\n",
      "former service is questionable; and the manner in which Mr. Dickens\r\n",
      "performs it sometimes conveys a certain impression of charlatanism. The\r\n",
      "value of the latter service is incontestable, and here Mr. Dickens is an\r\n",
      "honest, an admirable artist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what is the condition of the truly great novelist? For him there are\r\n",
      "no alternatives, for him there are no oddities, for him there is nothing\r\n",

      "him alone, therefore, there is a true and a false; for him alone, it is\r\n",
      "possible to be right, because it is possible to be wrong. Mr. Dickens is\r\n",
      "a great observer and a great humourist, but he is nothing of a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Some people may hereupon say, so much the better; we say, so much the\r\n",

      "can, indeed, dispense with it, for this--we say it with all\r\n",
      "deference--is not serious writing. But when he comes to tell the story\r\n",
      "of a passion, a story like that of Headstone and Wrayburn, he becomes a\r\n",
      "moralist as well as an artist. He must know _man_ as well as _men_, and\r\n",

      "essentially picturesque poet, his picturesqueness is of an infinitely\r\n",
      "milder type than that of Victor Hugo; the one ends where the other\r\n",
      "begins. With Victor Hugo the horrible is always the main element of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It is singular how soon the public gets used to unfamiliar notions. By\r\n",

      "properly. He must compare the author of \"Maud\" and the earlier _Idyls_\r\n",
      "with the great poets, and not with the small. _Harold_ would be a\r\n",
      "respectable production for a writer who had spent his career in\r\n",
      "producing the same sort of thing, but it is a somewhat graceless anomaly\r\n",

      "roughly speaking, is to _Queen Mary_ what that work is to the author's\r\n",
      "earlier masterpieces. _Harold_ is not in the least bad: it contains\r\n",
      "nothing ridiculous, unreasonable, or disagreeable; it is only decidedly\r\n",
      "weak, decidedly colourless, and tame. The author's inspiration is like a\r\n",
      "fire which is quietly and contentedly burning low. The analogy is\r\n",
      "perfectly complete. The hearth is clean swept and the chimney-side is\r\n",

      "damages brought against Mr. Ruskin by Mr. James Whistler, the American\r\n",

      "London world, and his conspicuity, combined with the renown of the\r\n",
      "defendant and the nature of the case, made the affair the talk of the\r\n",
      "moment. All the newspapers have had leading articles upon it, and people\r\n",

      "long time addressed to a partly edified, partly irritated, and greatly\r\n",
      "amused public. Mr. Ruskin spoke at some length of the pictures at the\r\n",

      "from a critic of Mr. Ruskin's eminence, they had done him,\r\n",
      "professionally, serious injury; and he asked for L1,000 damage. The case\r\n",
      "had a two days' hearing, and it was a singular and most regrettable\r\n",

      "singular canvases were handed about in court, and the counsel for the\r\n",
      "defence, holding one of them up, called upon the jury to pronounce\r\n",

      "character of the process to which he had been summoned (by the defence)\r\n",
      "to contribute, and who spoke of Mr. Whistler's performance as only in a\r\n",

      "indicating an extraordinary power of representing the atmosphere, but as\r\n",
      "being also hardly more than beginnings, and fatally deficient in finish.\r\n",
      "For the rest the crudity and levity of the whole affair were decidedly\r\n",

      "to have done, while--putting aside the degree of one's appreciation of\r\n",
      "his works--I quite understand his resentment. Mr. Ruskin's language\r\n",
      "quite transgresses the decencies of criticism, and he has been laying\r\n",
      "about him for some years past with such promiscuous violence that it\r\n",
      "gratifies one's sense of justice to see him brought up as a disorderly\r\n",
      "character. On the other hand, he is a chartered libertine--he has\r\n",
      "possessed himself by prescription of the function of a general scold.\r\n",
      "His literary bad manners are recognised, and many of his contemporaries\r\n",
      "have suffered from them without complaining. It would very possibly,\r\n",
      "therefore, have been much wiser on Mr. Whistler's part to feign\r\n",
      "indifference. Unfortunately, Mr. Whistler's productions are so very\r\n",
      "eccentric and imperfect (I speak here of his paintings only; his\r\n",

      "confirmed by a style sometimes indeed idiomatic and unfinished to a\r\n",

      "a meadow near Stratford, stops her and talks with her, and finds an\r\n",
      "ineffable delight in \"the sweet and novel twang of her words. Her family\r\n",

      "lakes\" in Hyde Park, and affirms that the English rural landscape does\r\n",
      "not, in comparison with the American, appear highly populated. This\r\n",
      "latter statement is apparently made apropos of that long stretch of\r\n",
      "suburban scenery, pure and simple, which extends from Liverpool to\r\n",
      "London. It does not strike us as felicitous, either, to say that women\r\n",
      "are more kindly treated in England than in the United States, and\r\n",
      "especially that they are less \"leered at.\" \"Leering\" at women is happily\r\n",
      "less common all the world over than it is sometimes made to appear for\r\n",
      "picturesque purposes in the magazines; but we should say that if there\r\n",

      "enviable as the tale is startling that his productions tell of his being\r\n",
      "at home, domesticated and initiated, in this wicked and weary world. At\r\n",
      "times he strikes us as shockingly precocious, at others as serenely\r\n",

      "can command so much of both kinds. It is still as one of the morbid, no\r\n",
      "doubt--that is, as one of those who are capable of sitting up all night\r\n",
      "for a new impression of talent, of scouring the trodden field for one\r\n",

      "of knowing his way about life. Curious in the highest degree and well\r\n",
      "worth attention is such an idiosyncrasy as this in a young Anglo-Saxon.\r\n",
      "We meet it with familiar frequency in the budding talents of France, and\r\n",
      "it startles and haunts us for an hour. After an hour, however, the\r\n",
      "mystery is apt to fade, for we find that the wondrous initiation is not\r\n",
      "in the least general, is only exceedingly special, and is, even with\r\n",
      "this limitation, very often rather conventional. In a word, it is with\r\n",
      "the ladies that the young Frenchman takes his ease, and more\r\n",
      "particularly with the ladies selected expressly to make this attitude\r\n",
      "convincing. When they have let him off, the dimnesses too often\r\n",
      "encompass him. But for Mr. Kipling there are no dimnesses anywhere, and\r\n",
      "if the ladies are indeed violently distinct they are not only strong\r\n",
      "notes in a universal loudness. This loudness fills the ears of Mr.\r\n",
      "Kipling's admirers (it lacks sweetness, no doubt, for those who are not\r\n",
      "of the number), and there is really only one strain that is absent from\r\n",
      "it--the voice, as it were, of the civilised man; in whom I of course\r\n",
      "also include the civilised woman. But this is an element that for the\r\n",
      "present one does not miss--every other note is so articulate and direct.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a part of the satisfaction the author gives us that he can make us\r\n",
      "speculate as to whether he will be able to complete his picture\r\n",
      "altogether (this is as far as we presume to go in meddling with the\r\n",
      "question of his future) without bringing in the complicated soul. On the\r\n",
      "day he does so, if he handles it with anything like the cleverness he\r\n",
      "has already shown, the expectation of his friends will take a great\r\n",
      "bound. Meanwhile, at any rate, we have Mulvaney, and Mulvaney is after\r\n",
      "all tolerably complicated. He is only a six-foot saturated Irish\r\n",
      "private, but he is a considerable pledge of more to come. Hasn't he, for\r\n",
      "that matter, the tongue of a hoarse siren, and hasn't he also mysteries\r\n",
      "and infinitudes almost Carlylese? Since I am speaking of him I may as\r\n",
      "well say that, as an evocation, he has probably led captive those of\r\n",
      "Mr. Kipling's readers who have most given up resistance. He is a piece\r\n",
      "of portraiture of the largest, vividest kind, growing and growing on the\r\n",
      "painter's hands without ever outgrowing them. I can't help regarding\r\n",
      "him, in a certain sense, as Mr. Kipling's tutelary deity--a landmark in\r\n",
      "the direction in which it is open to him to look furthest. If the author\r\n",
      "will only go as far in this direction as Mulvaney is capable of taking\r\n",
      "him (and the inimitable Irishman is like Voltaire's Habakkuk, _capable\r\n",
      "de tout_) he may still discover a treasure and find a reward for the\r\n",
      "services he has rendered the winner of Dinah Shadd. I hasten to add that\r\n",
      "the truly appreciative reader should surely have no quarrel with the\r\n",
      "primitive element in Mr. Kipling's subject-matter, or with what, for\r\n",
      "want of a better name, I may call his love of low life. What is that but\r\n",
      "essentially a part of his freshness? And for what part of his freshness\r\n",
      "are we exactly more thankful than for just this smart jostle that he\r\n",
      "gives the old stupid superstition that the amiability of a story-teller\r\n",
      "is the amiability of the people he represents--that their vulgarity, or\r\n",
      "depravity, or gentility, or fatuity are tantamount to the same qualities\r\n",
      "in the painter itself? A blow from which, apparently, it will not easily\r\n",
      "recover is dealt this infantine philosophy by Mr. Howells when, with the\r\n",
      "most distinguished dexterity and all the detachment of a master, he\r\n",
      "handles some of the clumsiest, crudest, most human things in\r\n",
      "life--answering surely thereby the play-goers in the sixpenny gallery\r\n",
      "who howl at the representative of the villain when he comes before the\r\n",
      "curtain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing is more refreshing than this active, disinterested sense of the\r\n",
      "real; it is doubtless the quality for the want of more of which our\r\n",
      "English and American fiction has turned so wofully stale. We are ridden\r\n",
      "by the old conventionalities of type and small proprieties of\r\n",
      "observance--by the foolish baby-formula (to put it sketchily) of the\r\n",
      "picture and the subject. Mr. Kipling has all the air of being disposed\r\n",
      "to lift the whole business off the nursery carpet, and of being perhaps\r\n",
      "even more able than he is disposed. One must hasten of course to\r\n",
      "parenthesise that there is not, intrinsically, a bit more luminosity in\r\n",
      "treating of low life and of primitive man than of those whom\r\n",
      "civilisation has kneaded to a finer paste: the only luminosity in either\r\n",
      "case is in the intelligence with which the thing is done. But it so\r\n",
      "happens that, among ourselves, the frank, capable outlook, when turned\r\n",
      "upon the vulgar majority, the coarse, receding edges of the social\r\n",
      "perspective, borrows a charm from being new; such a charm as, for\r\n",
      "instance, repetition has already despoiled it of among the French--the\r\n",
      "hapless French who pay the penalty as well as enjoy the glow of living\r\n",
      "intellectually so much faster than we. It is the most inexorable part\r\n",
      "of our fate that we grow tired of everything, and of course in due time\r\n",
      "we may grow tired even of what explorers shall come back to tell us\r\n",
      "about the great grimy condition, or, with unprecedented items and\r\n",
      "details, about the gray middle state which darkens into it. But the\r\n",
      "explorers, bless them! may have a long day before that; it is early to\r\n",
      "trouble about reactions, so that we must give them the benefit of every\r\n",
      "presumption. We are thankful for any boldness and any sharp curiosity,\r\n",
      "and that is why we are thankful for Mr. Kipling's general spirit and for\r\n",
      "most of his excursions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many of these, certainly, are into a region not to be designated as\r\n",
      "superficially dim, though indeed the author always reminds us that India\r\n",
      "is above all the land of mystery. A large part of his high spirits, and\r\n",
      "of ours, comes doubtless from the amusement of such vivid, heterogeneous\r\n",
      "material, from the irresistible magic of scorching suns, subject\r\n",
      "empires, uncanny religions, uneasy garrisons and smothered-up\r\n",
      "women--from heat and colour and danger and dust. India is a portentous\r\n",
      "image, and we are duly awed by the familiarities it undergoes at Mr.\r\n",
      "Kipling's hand and by the fine impunity, the sort of fortune that\r\n",
      "favours the brave, of _his_ want of awe. An abject humility is not his\r\n",
      "strong point, but he gives us something instead of it--vividness and\r\n",
      "drollery, the vision and the thrill of many things, the misery and\r\n",
      "strangeness of most, the personal sense of a hundred queer contacts and\r\n",
      "risks. And then in the absence of respect he has plenty of knowledge,\r\n",
      "and if knowledge should fail him he would have plenty of invention.\r\n",
      "Moreover, if invention should ever fail him, he would still have the\r\n",
      "lyric string and the patriotic chord, on which he plays admirably; so\r\n",
      "that it may be said he is a man of resources. What he gives us, above\r\n",
      "all, is the feeling of the English manner and the English blood in\r\n",
      "conditions they have made at once so much and so little their own; with\r\n",
      "manifestations grotesque enough in some of his satiric sketches and\r\n",
      "deeply impressive in some of his anecdotes of individual responsibility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His Indian impressions divide themselves into three groups, one of\r\n",
      "which, I think, very much outshines the others. First to be mentioned\r\n",
      "are the tales of native life, curious glimpses of custom and\r\n",
      "superstition, dusky matters not beholden of the many, for which the\r\n",
      "author has a remarkable _flair_. Then comes the social, the Anglo-Indian\r\n",
      "episode, the study of administrative and military types, and of the\r\n",
      "wonderful rattling, riding ladies who, at Simla and more desperate\r\n",
      "stations, look out for husbands and lovers; often, it would seem, and\r\n",
      "husbands and lovers of others. The most brilliant group is devoted\r\n",
      "wholly to the common soldier, and of this series it appears to me that\r\n",
      "too much good is hardly to be said. Here Mr. Kipling, with all his\r\n",
      "off-handedness, is a master; for we are held not so much by the greater\r\n",
      "or less oddity of the particular yarn--sometimes it is scarcely a yarn\r\n",
      "at all, but something much less artificial--as by the robust attitude of\r\n",
      "the narrator, who never arranges or glosses or falsifies, but makes\r\n",
      "straight for the common and the characteristic. I have mentioned the\r\n",
      "great esteem in which I hold Mulvaney--surely a charming man and one\r\n",
      "qualified to adorn a higher sphere. Mulvaney is a creation to be proud\r\n",
      "of, and his two comrades stand as firm on their legs. In spite of\r\n",
      "Mulvaney's social possibilities, they are all three finished brutes; but\r\n",
      "it is precisely in the finish that we delight. Whatever Mr. Kipling may\r\n",
      "relate about them forever will encounter readers equally fascinated and\r\n",
      "unable fully to justify their faith.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Are not those literary pleasures after all the most intense which are\r\n",
      "the most perverse and whimsical, and even indefensible? There is a logic\r\n",
      "in them somewhere, but it often lies below the plummet of criticism. The\r\n",
      "spell may be weak in a writer who has every reasonable and regular\r\n",
      "claim, and it may be irresistible in one who presents himself with a\r\n",
      "style corresponding to a bad hat. A good hat is better than a bad one,\r\n",
      "but a conjuror may wear either. Many a reader will never be able to say\r\n",
      "what secret human force lays its hand upon him when Private Ortheris,\r\n",
      "having sworn \"quietly into the blue sky,\" goes mad with homesickness by\r\n",
      "the yellow river and raves for the basest sights and sounds of London. I\r\n",
      "can scarcely tell why I think \"The Courting of Dinah Shadd\" a\r\n",
      "masterpiece (though, indeed, I can make a shrewd guess at one of the\r\n",
      "reasons), nor would it be worth while perhaps to attempt to defend the\r\n",
      "same pretension in regard to \"On Greenhow Hill\"--much less to trouble\r\n",
      "the tolerant reader of these remarks with a statement of how many more\r\n",
      "performances in the nature of \"The End of the Passage\" (quite admitting\r\n",
      "even that they might not represent Mr. Kipling at his best) I am\r\n",
      "conscious of a latent relish for. One might as well admit while one is\r\n",
      "about it that one has wept profusely over \"The Drums of the Fore and\r\n",
      "Aft,\" the history of the \"Dutch courage\" of two dreadful dirty little\r\n",
      "boys, who, in the face of Afghans scarcely more dreadful, saved the\r\n",
      "reputation of their regiment and perished, the least mawkishly in the\r\n",
      "world, in a squalor of battle incomparably expressed. People who know\r\n",
      "how peaceful they are themselves and have no bloodshed to reproach\r\n",
      "themselves with needn't scruple to mention the glamour that Mr.\r\n",
      "Kipling's intense militarism has for them, and how astonishing and\r\n",
      "contagious they find it, in spite of the unromantic complexion of\r\n",
      "it--the way it bristles with all sorts of ugliness and technicalities.\r\n",
      "Perhaps that is why I go all the way even with \"The Gadsbys\"--the\r\n",
      "Gadsbys were so connected (uncomfortably, it is true) with the army.\r\n",
      "There is fearful fighting--or a fearful danger of it--in \"The Man Who\r\n",
      "Would be King\"; is that the reason we are deeply affected by this\r\n",
      "extraordinary tale? It is one of them, doubtless, for Mr. Kipling has\r\n",
      "many reasons, after all, on his side, though they don't equally call\r\n",
      "aloud to be uttered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One more of them, at any rate, I must add to these unsystematised\r\n",
      "remarks--it is the one I spoke of a shrewd guess at in alluding to \"The\r\n",
      "Courting of Dinah Shadd.\" The talent that produces such a tale is a\r\n",
      "talent eminently in harmony with the short story, and the short story\r\n",
      "is, on our side of the Channel and of the Atlantic, a mine which will\r\n",
      "take a great deal of working. Admirable is the clearness with which Mr.\r\n",
      "Kipling perceives this--perceives what innumerable chances it gives,\r\n",
      "chances of touching life in a thousand different places, taking it up in\r\n",
      "innumerable pieces, each a specimen and an illustration. In a word, he\r\n",
      "appreciates the episode, and there are signs to show that this\r\n",
      "shrewdness will, in general, have long innings. It will find the\r\n",
      "detachable, compressible \"case\" an admirable, flexible form; the\r\n",
      "cultivation of which may well add to the mistrust already entertained\r\n",
      "by Mr. Kipling, if his manner does not betray him, for what is clumsy\r\n",
      "and tasteless in the time-honoured practice of the \"plot.\" It will\r\n",
      "fortify him in the conviction that the vivid picture has a greater\r\n",
      "communicative value than the Chinese puzzle. There is little enough\r\n",
      "\"plot\" in such a perfect little piece of hard representation as \"The End\r\n",
      "of the Passage,\" to cite again only the most salient of twenty examples.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I am speaking of our author's future, which is the luxury that I\r\n",
      "meant to forbid myself--precisely because the subject is so tempting.\r\n",
      "There is nothing in the world (for the prophet) so charming as to\r\n",
      "prophesy, and as there is nothing so inconclusive the tendency should be\r\n",
      "repressed in proportion as the opportunity is good. There is a certain\r\n",
      "want of courtesy to a peculiarly contemporaneous present even in\r\n",

      "what will become in the later hours of the day of a talent that has got\r\n",
      "up so early. Mr. Kipling's actual performance is like a tremendous walk\r\n",
      "before breakfast, making one welcome the idea of the meal, but consider\r\n",
      "with some alarm the hours still to be traversed. Yet if his breakfast is\r\n",
      "all to come, the indications are that he will be more active than ever\r\n",
      "after he has had it. Among these indications are the unflagging\r\n",
      "character of his pace and the excellent form, as they say in athletic\r\n",
      "circles, in which he gets over the ground. We don't detect him\r\n",
      "stumbling; on the contrary, he steps out quite as briskly as at first,\r\n",
      "and still more firmly. There is something zealous and craftsman-like in\r\n",
      "him which shows that he feels both joy and responsibility. A whimsical,\r\n",
